Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Washington Homeland Security Roundtable Launches Office of Security Capabilities Engagement Group as Part of Its WHSR / Transportation Security Administration Industry Forum
<p>WHSR to Host Office of Security Capabilities Engagement Group on Tuesday, November 27th, 2012</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Washington Homeland Security Roundtable (WHSR) today announced creation of the Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) Engagement Group, in collaboration with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), as part of its on-going WHSR / TSA Industry Forum and outreach initiative which was launched on June 5th.</p>
<p>The first OSC Engagement Group will be held on Thursday, November 27th from 10:00am to 12:00pm at TSA's Transportation Security Integration Facility, located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Registration for the OSC Engagement Group is limited to 40 companies (1 representative each only) and open to both WHSR members and non-members.</p>
<p>As part of the ongoing industry outreach initiative, WHSR, in conjunction with TSA, announced a series of focus groups - the first of which was the Contracting / Acquisition Policy Focus Group and held its first meeting in October 2012. Additional focus groups will be announced over the next few weeks and will concentrate on areas such as small business and industry engagement among others.</p>
<p>TSA's OSC oversees security screening capabilities and technology field at airports nationwide and is responsible for the operational testing and evaluation, procurement, deployment, installation and maintenance of those capabilities. The main objective of the OSC Engagement Group is to collaborate with industry, specifically focusing on incorporating participants' input on OSC's strategic plan and other areas of strategic importance. The OSC Engagement Group has been invited to provide a representative to a larger stakeholder group to represent the industry perspective in developing an OSC Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>To register for the OSC Engagement Group, please visit www.whsroundtable.org/OSCEngagement. Participation is limited to 40 companies (1 representative each only) and open to both WHSR members and non-members.
