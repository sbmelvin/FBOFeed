<SUBJECT>B--Researching Technical Dialogue With Alaskan Coastal Communities:  Analysis of the Social, Cultural, Linguistic, and Institutional Parameters of Public/Agency Communication Patterns

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This announcement is in response to the original Request for Information (RFI) posted April 1, 2004.  This project is no longer set aside for Small Business.  This is a Full and Open Competition, Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Abstract of Study:  Since U.S. Government decision-makers rely intrinsically upon effective communication with an informed public, this study aims to improve the ongoing technical dialogue between local citizens and the Alaska Regional Office of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Offshore Program.  For this study, technical dialogue refers to the formal written process of two-way communication between local citizens and the agency concerning information about (or from) the MMS and its administrative activities with regard to resource evaluation, leasing, regulating industry, conducting environmental studies, and producing environmental assessments or impact statements in the Alaska region.  This study will investigate the effects and dynamics of written communication efforts in Cook Inlet and North Slope Borough planning areas as manifested by the medium of an Environmental Impact Statement.  It will seek to enrich the exchange of pertinent information and the pursuit of mutual understanding with diverse stakeholder groups by systematically identifying and analyzing communication methods and potential problems within a specific socio-cultural and politico-institutional context.  The study will also explore possible improvements through pilot-testing a series of experimental newsletters on targeted focus groups.  If significant communication obstacles can be identified and reduced through controlled testing, the study would then formulate plausible recommendations to help shape future agency interactions with the public.  In general terms, the study seeks to provide some fresh insight into the following types of questions:  Is the MMS successfully communicating the messages that it intends to communicate?  Are unintended messages being communicated?  Do local citizens feel adequately informed about the matters they deem pertinent?  How can the transmission of unintended messages be avoided?  How can the MMS enhance public opportunities to respond to agency messages in technically rich and precise language?  Are some stakeholder concerns inadvertently overlooked through the exiting NEPA process?  Are recent attempts to translate the EIS into minority languages effective?  Should the MMS supplement broadcast public documents with narrow-cast newsletter formats?  Can the MMS improve communication techniques through cost efficient measures?  By seeking to improve technical dialogue and reduce areas of miscommunication, this study will enhance opportunities for citizens of Alaskan coastal communities to participate more fully in the NEPA decision-making process.  It will further involve subjecting a series of draft newsletter communications to rigorous evaluation by a sample of community residents.  Throughout, the primary orientation will be focused on conducting appropriate social research rather than on implementing "outreach" or public relations.  These overarching goals will be accomplished through the following intermediary objectives:  1.  Conduct a literature search (and key informant review) to document and assess alternative models of federal agency written communication efforts with local residents that are relevant to the goals of this study and related processes in the Alaska region; the review will specifically encompass appropriate linguistic considerations that may influence the effectiveness of technical dialogue;  2.  Sample and analyze the record of public comments from MMS planning activities in the Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea to assess the range of communication issues and stakeholder perspectives specific to technical dialogue in the Alaska region;  3.  Interview appropriate MMS technical staff and management to identify and clarify the institutional parameters of potential communication obstacles with various stakeholders which reduce effective technical dialogue;  4.  Document key findings about technical dialogue and significant communication challenges in the Alaska region;  5.  Identify appropriate samples of study participants in communities on the North Slope and on the Kenai Peninsula and organize them into focus groups;  6.  Conduct a series of focus group meetings to assess public knowledge and attitudes about the OCS regulatory environment, the communication of scientific and technical information, and the scoping process in general;  7.  Collaborate with MMS management and staff to prepare experimental newsletters that will allow for testing the effectiveness of key agency technical messages across a range of social variables;  8.  Conduct a second series of focus group meetings to test a variety of newsletter messages against the baseline reactions; monitor changes in understanding, perceptions of technical information, and durability of opinions among study participants associated with new materials;  9.  Continue to test and monitor technical communication efforts in a limited and controlled newsletter format until a model based upon "lessons learned" can be implemented;  10.  Analyze and report the results of the focus group sessions in a final project report; report summary findings back to host communities; submit first draft of a scholarly publication. The period of performance for this project is 16 months.  The total value of this procurement is estimated not to exceed $320,000.00.  Deliverables include periodic progress reports; report of literature search; report of public testimony analysis; report of MMS staff interviews; interim research report; experimental newsletters; draft and final report; draft of journal article.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NFEC), Southwest Division, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Environmental Remediation Services at various locations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  Resulting Contract’s will be fixed price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Environment Multiple Award Contract’s (EMAC).

This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business (See Note 1).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility of a small business.  NFEC Southwest intends to award more than two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity small business contracts.  

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contracts include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants may include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $60,000,000.

Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 4 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.  

A pre-proposal site visit/meeting will be at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California for the proposed Task Order 0001 project.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate and award a noncompetitive purchase order to Keith A. Horvath, M.D., 1735 North Winchester Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, 60614, to provide consultation services to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI),  Division of Intramural Research (DIR),  in their efforts to reestablish its Cardiothoracic Surgery Branch (CTSB).   Specifically, the tasks to be performed by Dr. Horvath for this requirement are program planning, program development, marketing, public relations, and general administrative services to assure the successful development of the CTSB.   The NHLBI planned approach for the CTSB is to first establish clinical excellence, and then follow by pursuing mutually beneficial collaborations.  NIH offers links between basic science and clinical investigations, relative swiftness in translating basic science to clinical usage, access to state-of the art animal facilities, presence multi disciplinary research teams, capability to focus on selected science and health problems, support of a centralized coordinating facility, organization of a center of excellence in clinical research and ability to provide integrated service delivery.  Dr. Horvath is Board Certified in Surgery and in Thoracic Surgery.   Dr. Horvath possesses a vast knowledge and background in Cardiothoracic surgery and has the administrative skills to effectively develop the CTSB.  The determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is based upon Dr. Horvath background, knowledge, and research in Cardiothoracic surgery and administrative skills.  The period of performance for this project is not expected to exceed four (4) months from the award date of the contract.    Responses will be evaluated based upon their demonstrated past experience, knowledge, skills and abilities in cardiac thoracic surgery and successful development and implementation of a Cardiothoracic surgery  research program.    The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An award to any other source would affect the NHLBI’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Horvath’s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and commercial item procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number “NHLBI-PS-2004-086,” may be submitted to the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20814-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for DREP Solicitation Number RFP-4200059942-GBR for industry comment.  NASA GSFC, in support to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires a contractor to perform the formulation and implementation activities for the Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS) for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R series project.  The development of the SEISS will provide measurements of the proton, electron, and heavy ion fluxes at geosynchronous orbit, which will replace and augment the current GOES N Series Energetic Particle Sensors. The acquisition of the SESS will follow a phased development strategy that will include two major phases, Formulation and Implementation.  The Formulation Phase shall serve as the foundation for the implementation contract.  Two firm-fixed price contracts will be awarded for the Formulation Phase, and one cost-plus-award-fee contract for the Implementation Phase. Therefore, the issuance of DRFP RFP-4200059942-GBR is for the Formulation Phase only.  This Formulation Phase of the SEISS development includes system requirements analyses that evaluate all requirements, identify those requirements that drive risk, cost, or spacecraft resources, and identify any requirement that may be improved with minimal or no impact on risk, cost, or spacecraft resources. The Formulation Phase requires both technical as well as program management effort that will result in a final definition of requirements, and the submission of a concept design that may be the basis of the contractor's implementation proposal. The Contractor shall conduct trade studies, trade-off analyses, risk analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses to ensure that a thorough and comprehensive set of options and alternatives is considered and analyzed for design, with consideration for all aspects of the system life cycle and all aspects of system life cycle cost. This DRFP is for information and planning purposes. No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this DRFP. Potential Offerors are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation, including the requirements, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach. If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions. NASA anticipates issuance of the DRFP during the month of June 2004 with industry comments due approximately 15 days from the date the DRFP is first made available. Monitor the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page Internet site for the release of the DRFP and subsequent RFP. NASA anticipates issuance of the final RFP approximately 30 days after DRFP comments are received with proposals due 30 days later. This effort will be full and open competition with separate awards for the two distinct phases, Phase 1 - Formulation, and Phase 2 - Implementation.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51	  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Prospective offerors are requested to notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the draft and final solicitation and amendments (if any). Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.  All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or FAX).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. For the past three years, EPA stakeholders have requested a higher quality roads database than the current TIGER database made freely available by the US census Bureau. This request is a result of growing concern about the relative positional accuracy of  facilities and places of interest to EPA. Higher quality roads data is critical for maintaining accurate and authoritative facility identification records in FRS and in EPA's expanding role in providing emergency response capabilities. Collectively, this has led to a decision to expand on a license  currently to an enterprise-wide level of distribution for map-based environmental analysis. This request for quotation (RFQ), RFQ-DC-04-00191 number is for the procurement of Enterprise-Wide Deployment of Roads Data through a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-perpetual Grant of License to 1) use  the data for its own internal purposes by any authorized EPA user who may use, copy, and distribute the data for internal EPA use, 2) use the data in any EPA sponsored intranet application, 3) use the data for "web locator" purposes, where the general public may enter a single address in order to  locate themselves, or the nearest object of interest.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(B)(1), with Coherent Laser Group, Santa Clara, CA 95054  for the purchase of a TI:TUNE/BREAK-FREE BRF SET.  

The required equipment is an add on function to an existing instrumentation system.  The combined set is offered to continuously tune the 899-01 laser.  Set includes cavity optics, three output couplers, and a bread-free birefringent filter.  Since the existing instrumentation is proprietary no other source is available for the required application module.  The existing instrumentation was originally supplied by Coherent Laser Group, therefore proprietary and no other supplier can offer TI:TUNE/BREAK-FREE BRF SET.

Delivery shall be FOB origin, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 4-6 weeks after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees. 
 
No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 1, 2004.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Any questions/concerns regarding this notice should be forwarded in writing via e-mail to the Purchasing Agent, A. Barbara Guise @ Barbara.guise@nist.gov.

<DESC>This is a draft RFI being posted to alert industry to a solicitation that will be issued in the future and to obtain comment from industry on a draft of the performance work statement intended to be used for the procurement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The U.S. Department of State intends to procure services to support the Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement in the accomplishment of its Humanitarian Mine Action and Small Arms/Light Weapons Removal and Destruction mission.  The types of services to be included in this procurement are: Program Planning and Management Support, Program Administration Support, Information Management Support, Program Review, Quality Oversight Support, and Program Awareness and Outreach Support.  A  SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of a contract.  A DRAFT copy of the performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis.  The Government intends to award to small business.  The Department anticipates the award of one or more indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, with Task Orders being issued to subsequently authorize the work.  It is anticipated that cost-reimbursable and firm fixed price elements will be used for this procurement. Any task orders awarded under the contract may be a combination of firm fixed price and cost reimbursable elements depending on the nature of the work.  At least one yet to be determined task order will be competed at time of contract award. The RFP is not complete but a draft of the performance work statement (PWS) is enclosed for comment.  A Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (developed by and implemented by the Government) and incentive plan have not been written yet and we welcome comments from industry in these areas.  ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  In accordance with FAR 15.201, this DRAFT RFI is an "exchange with industry before receipt of proposals".  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  There is no FAR requirement for a reply to the questions or comments received from posting a draft PWS.  The Department may choose to answer the questions received but there is no duty to do so.  The Draft PWS may be amended based on feedback provided by industry if warranted.  The final PWS will be incorporated into and issued as part of an RFP on or about June 23, 2004.  The solicitation will be posted on FEDBIZZOPPS on or about June 23, 2004.  PLEASE DO NOT CALL THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR STATUS OF THE RELASE OF THE SOLITATION.  It is anticipated that there will be a down-select based on technical experience on contracts of similar size with those most qualified providing full proposals, including oral proposals, with pricing on at least one task order.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  The closing date for the receipt of offers will be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.  Questions or comments on our anticipated methods and on the draft PWS should be submitted by email only to the contracting specialist, Kelly Bracey (BraceyKM@state.gov), no later than June 8, 2004.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE RETURNED.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Introduction:

The U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) collects detailed population and housing data to produce estimates of socioeconomic characteristics.  The data provided by the ACS throughout the decade corresponds to the data that the U.S. Census Bureau historically collected once every ten years during the decennial census. The Census Bureau began a full operational test of the ACS in four counties in October 1995 and added new counties each year through 2000.  Beginning in July 2004, we plan to expand the ACS by selecting an independent sample of approximately 240,000 addresses each month from all counties in the United States.  

Synopsis of Requirement:

The Census Bureau has a requirement for a contractor to use Census Bureau-provided rules to match approximately 240,000 sample addresses provided by the Census Bureau against the contractor=s address database to obtain a published telephone number for as many of the sample addresses as possible.  The contractor will be required to perform an exact match on basic street address, and, where present, on unit designation. The Census Bureau may require more than one contractor to match the same set of addresses because a second contractor may successfully match an address that the first contractor could not.  

The contractor will be required to provide the Census Bureau with a file in ASCII format of addresses (including ZIP+4) and matching current telephone numbers. The Census Bureau will determine the monthly file delivery schedule. 

Title 13 of the United States Code protects the confidentiality of the address information provided by the Census Bureau. Therefore, the contractor must perform the match in a pre-approved secured computer environment and return the original Census Bureau files. The contractor cannot retain a copy of the Census Bureau file or the information it contains. 

The solicitation is scheduled for release on May 28, 2004.  See the solicitation for further details, including additional IT security requirements.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer contractor questions.  The date for submission of proposals is not extended.  QUESTION 1.  The solicitation outlines numerous vehicle requirements.  Are SUVs required for the off road training portions while sedans are required for the collision avoidance, decision making drills, braking techniques, etc?   ANSWER: Off-road driving training portions require SUVs to replicate driving scenarios that my unit members typically face in rural environments.  Training exercises must include: evaluation of terrain, driving techniques in four-wheel drive vehicles such as SUVs or pick-up trucks in varying terrain and surface conditions.  Operators must size-up and plan hasty routes through terrain, then navigate through the terrain.  They must also learn how to recover vehicles that get stuck in sand or mud.  QUESTION 2. Are the sedans crash vehicles?  ANSWER: Crash vehicles are preferred to exercise realistic counter-ambush techniques, ramming techniques, and escape countermeasures.  These techniques and procedures require operable vehicles that can be crashed in real world ambush, chase, and IED scenarios.  The exercises also require fully capable excellent condition Sedans for the initial evasive driving course. For this portion of the training, crash vehicles will not suffice.  QUESTION 3.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is only open to 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide Washington State office.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.  Note, an additional Large 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.

If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) as soon as possible.  It is also recommended that the agreement be submitted as soon as practicable to ensure compliance with established regulations.

WIRING OF 10Mbp INTERNET CONNECTION AND SERVICES


Statement of Work

Phase I

The contractor shall provide and install 2 pair of single mode fiber (“the spare dark fiber”) from the telecommunications room, 3rd floor, South Building, 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, to the computer room in the East Building Basement, 4th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.   

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary Right-of-Ways and for the success of the overall installation of the spare dark fiber.  

NOTE TO OFFERORS:
Currently, all existing communications facilities use Verizon conduit through manhole number 3374.  The National Gallery of Art (NGA) desires to establish a diverse, redundant network path between the South Building at 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW and the East and West NGA Buildings.  However, the NGA will consider proposals using the Verizon manhole system.  The PEPCO manhole system and the Verizon manhole system are the entry points for communications services of which the Gallery is aware.  Other options may be proposed if they are available.

The following applies for vendors entering the Gallery using the Pepco manhole system.  Vendors choosing to propose an alternate path must submit a schematic detailing the path through the gallery as well as a written narrative describing the proposed installation.  Gallery staff will be available for a walk-though at 10:30 am on May 26th and May 27th.  

The contractor shall furnish and install all fiber in 3” EMT conduit with two inner ducts from the East Building entrance to the Telecommunications pull box 1 as shown on the two-sheet illustration provided upon request to b-manley@nga.gov.  The Contractor must use steel compression coupling.  The contractor shall support all conduits in accordance with BICSI installation standards. 
 
The Contractor shall enter the side of the pull box 1 and continue to pull fiber through entire conduit to room SC-8.  The Contractor shall install the fiber optic cable from pull box 1 to SC8.   The contractor will remove an abandoned cable from the 4” conduit between pull box 1 and SC-8 and install (2) two new inner ducts in its place.  The Contractor shall then cut the removed cables to the extent necessary to dispose of them in a Gallery-furnished dumpster outside the East Building.

The Contractor shall terminate all fiber in an LIU provided by the contractor on the back board in room SC-11.  Fiber shall be patched through to existing single mode fiber.  Contractor shall label, tag, and install fiber in a professional manner as per BICSI cabling installation standards for fiber.  


The Contractor’s completed installation must be approved by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), Katherine Green.

Phase II

The Contractor shall provide monthly 10Mbps connection internet access services in room CLA 6A in the connecting link between the NGA East and West Buildings with the use of installed fiber optics only.  No substitution is allowed.  The contractor shall provide primary DNS services for the NGA.  NOTE:  The offeror must specify the 10Mbps transmission protocol (i.e. Ethernet, ATM, or other) in their response to this solicitation. The implementation of these services must be approved by the COTR, Katherine Green.

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary Right-of-Ways and for the success of the overall installation and the 10Mbp INTERNET CONNECTION.


WORK HOURS AND PARKING

The Contractor shall perform all Phase I work on-site at the National Gallery of Art on Monday through Friday, excluding Holidays, from 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM, unless otherwise agreed to with the Contracting Officer.

Approval is not guaranteed. 


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The Contractor shall complete all work described above for Phase I within eight (10) weeks following contract award.  The National Gallery of Art will order monthly 10Mbp connection internet access service from the date beginning with completion of Phase I and ending on September 30, 2004.

4. Phase II OPTION TO EXTEND for monthly 10Mbp connection internet access service from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006.

The TOTAL EVALUATED PRICE shall be the sum of the offered prices for a BASE CONTRACT PERIOD if Phase I only and for a BASE CONTRACT PERIOD and all OPTIONS TO EXTEND if Phase II only.  The NGA will evaluate the total overall price to the NGA for all work in comparing offers received.

 

CONTRACT AWARD

The National Galley of Art will make a contractor selection based on the response(s) to this solicitation determined to be the most advantageous in terms of the three evaluation criteria stated above.	The NGA may select one contractor for Phase I , a separate contractor for Phase II, or one contractor for Phases I and II,  subject to offers received and determination of those that are most advantageous.  The NGA may decide to award a contract for Phase II only.

SECURITY

1.  Security Clearances

Security clearances are required for all contractor personnel working in the Gallery.   Immediately upon contract award, the contractor is to submit to the COTR the documentation for requests for security clearances for contractor personnel proposed to work on the contract.  The Gallery’s security office will perform a background security check on each proposed worker.  Because of the mission of the Gallery, and the potential for risk in permitting access to secured areas, there is no guarantee that a security clearance will be issued to any proposed employee.  The Gallery reserves the right to deny access to the Gallery areas during times when the Gallery is closed, and to deny access to non-public areas.   

1.1.  Documentation for Requests for Security Clearances

1.1.1  The request package must include the following completed documents, for each proposed employee.

The National Gallery of Art Authorization for Release of Information

The National Gallery of Art Contractor ID Request Form

(Copies of the blank documents follow this section.)

A clear photocopy of proposed employee’s driver’s license must be included in the package.  

1.1.2  The request package for permanent badges must include the following.

Optional Form 306-0182 Declaration for Federal Employment

The contractor shall submit request packages for all employees expected to work on site at the Gallery.  Obtaining security clearances is costly.  Therefore, the Gallery will not accept packages of requests that appear to be the contractor’s company roster.  Every effort will be made to complete security clearance checks quickly, however, the contractor shall plan for a seven work day processing period, for both initial requests and subsequent requests.  

The security staff will notify the COTR of the results of the security clearance check.  The COTR will immediately notify the contractor of the results.   In the event a proposed employee in not cleared for work at the Gallery, the contractor shall immediately – and within three work days, submit a request package for a substitute employee.  



1.2.  Badges

The Gallery issues two types of badges to contractor employees:  Permanent (“hard”) badges and temporary (paper) badges.  Each type has certain responsibilities and privileges.  It is completely at the Gallery’s discretion as to which type of badge is issued to contractors’ employees.   Each employee must wear the badge is a visible manner at all times when on Gallery property.  

Security Clauses (Continued)

All contractor employees who are issued temporary must sign-in and sign-out with the Gallery’s security staff, each time they enter/exit the Gallery.   Employees who have been issued permanent badges must scan the badge at each entry and exit.  
 
The permanent badge permits unaccompanied access to most Gallery areas.   The permanent badge is issued for a stated period of time, and is held by the employee until the expiration date or the time when the Gallery requests return.   

The temporary badge is issued on a daily basis and must be returned the security staff when exiting the Gallery.  Employees with temporary badges must be escorted when in the Gallery while the Gallery is closed to the public and when in non-public areas.  

The COTR will provide precise direction about Gallery access, at time of contract award. 

The contractor is responsible for immediately report any lost or misplaced badges to the COTR and the security staff.   The contractor is responsible for immediately returning any badges that where issued to employees who are no longer working on the contract.    

1.3  Access Hours

Generally, contractors will be permitted entry to the Gallery during the hours of 6:00AM and 6:00PM, Monday through Friday.  However, if a contract or task order requires different hours, those hours will be stated in the contract or task order.  

Work outside the normal contractor work hours or the hours required in a particular contract require prior COTR approval.  The contractor shall submit requests for different work hours to the COTR at least three business days before proposed change.  

Providing escorts for contractor employees is costly.  In order to contain costs, the contractor is responsible to notify the COTR if any employees will be arriving later than scheduled.  If the COTR is not available at the time of notification, the contractor shall notify the security staff of the proposed late arrival.  
   
1.4.   The designated point of entry to, and exit from, the Gallery, for contractor staff, is the West Building Service Entrance.   The Service Entrance is on Constitution Avenue, south of the Mellon Fountain and east of the Gallery’s 6th Street entrance.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

Currently, Cytyc Corporation’s ThinPrep Systems resides in many of the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  The ThinPrep Pap Test provides the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved option for MTFs to perform Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing after receiving an ASCUS (positive) result, out of the ThinPrep vial.  During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using Cytyc’s automated screening equipment, which read the slides automatically and will be procured under this solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- MUE Phase B Sources Sought Synopsis
<SOLNBR>FA8807-04-R-0005
<RESPDATE>060404
<ARCHDATE>06192004

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify potential sources capable of executing the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Program Phase B effort. System Description:  MUE is part of the overall GPS Modernization Effort (Space/Control/User Segment).  The Modernization upgrades will result in the addition of several new Civil Signals as well as a new military signal and security architecture.  The MUE program is the user segment component of the GPS Modernization program and is to validate that user equipment can be developed that effectively interoperate and exploit the capabilities of the modernized constellation. The MUE Program is nearing completion of Phase A and is preparing to enter Phase B. Phase A activities consist of government development and assessment of MUE technical requirements, alternative acquisition strategies, and preliminary cost estimates.  Additionally, four PRDA contracts were awarded to reduce program risk. Contract tasks included contractor assessment of key technical and design issues related to security architecture, receiver design, and the inclusion of multiple signal processing, YMCA.  Phase A activities are now sufficiently mature to enter into Phase B. The MUE Phase B program is a development program with the objective of demonstrating Y-code/M-code/Course Acquisition-code (CA)-(YMCA) receiving and processing capability using the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) Security Architecture.  The MUE Program is not a production program and will not directly result in the procurement of MUE under the anticipated Phase B contract effort. The primary products of the development will be validated Government controlled, non-proprietary, specifications (specs) and Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for the GPS Receiver Application Module Standard Electronic Module type E Modernized (GRAM-S/M) receiver card and Ground-based GPS Receiver Application Module-Modernized Small Serial Interface (SSI) (GB-GRAM-M SSI) receiver card.  The GRAM S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI cards will be developed to validate that operationally relevant cards can be developed based on the Government specs and ICDs and to provide an initial industrial base to support further development and procurement. The GPS JPO will not procure MUE unless directed and funded to do so by the Services.  It is anticipated that MUE procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service wide needs. To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following contract objectives are provided as reference: (a) Develop and deliver production representative YMCA GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI receiver cards in accordance with GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI Technical Requirements Documents (TRDs); (b) Develop and deliver non-proprietary draft GPS Engine specifications and ICDs; (c)	Recommend modifications to GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI specifications and ICDs; (d) Demonstrate compliance with the security functional requirements and the security assurance requirements in the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI protection profile;
(e) Execute the MUE information assurance security certification plan and recommend appropriate changesSupport integration and test of the GRAM S/M receiver card into a MAGR-2K; (g) Support integration and test of the GB-GRAM-M SSI receiver card into an Army application; (h) Support the update of other MUE and M-code related documents as directed; (i) Establish a strong, near real-time dialog and feedback structure with the GPS JPO to provide government insight, achieve quick issue resolution, and respond to government direction; (j) Develop capability to conduct MUE cryptographic initialization functionality and provide tracking of MUE configurations. GPS user equipment is an important element across the DOD force structure and represents a significant cost for the DOD. Accordingly a major emphasis in this development will be to implement mechanisms that will reduce the cost of non-recurring engineering (NRE) development across all future MUE procurements.  The government recognizes that the GPS Engine represents substantial development costs that are unique to MUE because of the new security architecture and security methods inherent to the M-Code signal and PRONAV.  The government seeks means to ensure that these and other NRE costs do not act as a barrier preventing potential suppliers and developers from entering the MUE market. Specifically, the government is currently investigating third party licensing agreements and data rights. The government intent is that the data rights or third party licensing agreement would allow a third party not currently familiar with the MUE security architecture and security requirements to successfully compete for future MUE developments. Accordingly, respondents to this announcement are encouraged to provide in addition to their capabilities statements information regarding their assessment of the value of data rights and/or licensing agreement and any other suggestions to assist the government in achieving its objective of reducing non-recurring engineering costs for the GPS Engine or MUE as a whole. Respondents are requested to identify any previous applicable experiences in supporting reduction of government NRE costs. After the receiver cards have been developed and delivered to the government the GRAM S/M will be integrated under separate contract into the MAGR-2K to validate the GRAM S/M ICD.  The card developer will supply technical support under an associate contractor agreement during the integration effort. The government currently anticipates that the GB GRAM-M will be integrated into a yet to be selected Army platform. Scope of effort: The MUE Phase B effort is anticipated to have a duration of 48 months, anticipated period of performance is April 2005–April 2009. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the MUE Phase B program objectives within acceptable risks and costs.  Respondents are required to submit a current statement of capability, if they have not already done so.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience. In addition, a Request for Information was published on 10 May 2004, in Federal Business Opportunities soliciting for potential sources of commercially available signal simulators to support the execution of Phase B of MUE Program.  See Special Notice, Solicitation Number: Reference-Number-43-MUE. Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor, subcontractor, or interest in using data rights/third party licensing to become a MUE developer and supplier.  All responses are to be unclassified.  Respondents interested in being a prime contractor should not exceed five (5) one sided pages. Respondents interested in being a subcontractor should not exceed two (2) one sided pages and should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise. Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary or competition sensitive data, they must request additional directions from Ms. Iris Green. Provide your statement of capability or contact Ms Iris Green at email Iris.Green@losangeles.af.mil. This synopsis is for planning purposes only any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover, the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions. All questions will be considered in future program planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. In addition, the government is interested in receiving industry views regarding the ongoing government acquisition planning efforts. The government intends to post draft and planning documents in the GPS Bidder's Library as they become available to allow industry to view and make comments.  Parties need to register with the GPS Bidder's Library, to obtain access.  Please submit a letter listing all of the individuals requiring access, and justification for access, and all contact information inclusive of email address.  Please submit requests to Lt Richard Kniseley at 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245, Phone: 310-363-5390, Fax: 310-363-3844;  email:  Richard.Kniseley@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to increase the number of compounds to be acquired to 10,000 per year, increase the libraries from 1-2 per year and increase the number of laboratories to which the contractor will supply compounds for evaluation of the biological effects to its seven (7) year contract N01-AI-95364 with Southern Research Institute (Southern). The contract provides for the selective acquisition of synthetic and pure natural product compounds from a wide variety of sources and within a wide variety of chemical classes, including libraries of compounds. The contract’s title is the Antimicrobial Acquisition and Coordinating Facility. The Statement of Work includes the following activities: receiving and storing chemical compounds, verifying purity, maintaining a computerized registry of unique structures, obtaining screening agreements, providing secure and safe facilities and resources, executing confidentiality agreements, distributing specific aliquots of compounds to contract laboratories for biological testing against infectious agents, recording data from other laboratories, and maintaining correspondence associated with testing. The contract initially set a target of approximately 4,000 compounds per year and focused on tuberculosis, including drug resistant tuberculosis.  Multiple Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an NIH Bio-terrorism Category C agent. The planned expansion will include increasing the number of compounds to be acquired to 10,000 per year, increase the number of libraries from 1-2 per year and to increase the number of laboratories to which the contractor will supply compounds for evaluation of the biological effects. The biological testing will include new microbes; especially organisms considered agents of bioterrorism (Categories A though C) which have the potential to cause emerging and re-emerging diseases. This expansion is expected to be accomplished within the contract’s current performance period ending September 29, 2006. See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is conducting a public-private competition to procure the services and support required to develop and operate the NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC). Under the rules of OMB Circular A-76, the Government will submit a proposal for a civil-servant led team or “Most Efficient Organization” (MEO) to perform this work. The MEO, known as QUESTeam, is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate in developing the QUESTeam proposal and, if selected, provide services to the NSSC. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential partners to perform the required tasks.  Synopsis:  NASA intends to consolidate selected business and technical services that currently are performed across the Agency, into a single shared services center to increase operational efficiency and improve overall customer service.  By consolidating services, NASA expects to achieve synergy within and across functions that will reduce resource requirements for institutional support areas and position the Agency for further business process improvements and innovation.  In general, the selected business and technical services under study are as follows: (1) Human Resources Services; (2) Financial Management Services; (3) Procurement Services, and (4) Information Technology Services.  The study may be expanded to include additional services/functions as necessary. The work is currently performed both by government personnel and by contractors.  It will be transitioned from the NASA Centers to the NSSC following contract or letter of obligation award.  Additional operational activities within the functions listed above may be migrated to the NSSC, as deemed appropriate by NASA. Potential partners interested in developing and operating components of a consolidated Center to process human resources, financial, information technology, and procurement transactions for the Agency are encouraged to apply. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide support consistent with the requirements of the Draft Performance Work Statement (  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=109154#Other  %2004).  The QUESTeam will select partner(s) based on the following criteria: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel: This criterion evaluates the potential partners' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar activities, technical capability to perform the work, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the potential partners' ability to control both cost and schedule. Potential partners should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. All potential partners are asked to submit capability statements expressing their interest.  Capability statements should be no more than 5 pages, and shall include, at a minimum: name and address of firm; size/ownership of business, i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Woman owned business, and Hub Zone; number of years in business; a point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and e-mail; Cage code and DUNS number (if available); experience and familiarity with providing the services listed above either individually or in a consolidated services type environment; any experience as a prime or subcontractor with major consolidation of functions from remote sites to one location; and specific areas of the PWS that the potential partner is interested in supporting. Subject to the availability of funds, selection of the QUESTeam proposal would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). However, this partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NSSC RFP.  The preferred method of submission is via email to: Lisa.May@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB June 1, 2004. Procurement questions should be directed to Lisa May, Agency Tender Official, Lisa.May@nasa.gov, 1700 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, (202) 358-2411.

9. 	AREA OF CONSIDERATION:  U.S. Citizens


I.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Benin is a sustainable development mission.  In 2003 the Mission is staffed with five Direct Hire Foreign Service Officers, four USPSCs, the health team advisor included, and 61 cooperating country nationals. The USAID/Benin program, with an annual operating year program budget of $16 million, includes strategic objectives in education, health, and a special objective in democracy/governance. The Mission also has a P.L. 480 Title II program which includes development interventions in primary education, maternal/child health, Agriculture, Child Trafficking, and village banking. 

Benin's population and health indicators are very poor. Child malnutrition is high, with 29% of children under 3 underweight, and treatable illnesses, such as malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality of children. Fertility rates and population growth are still high. Although the HIV prevalence rate is relatively low compared to other countries in the sub-region, it will rise rapidly without a coordinated and appropriate response. Segments of the population remain inadequately serviced by the public health system. While public health service coverage remains low,  the private health sector, both for-profit and not-for-profit, has grown rapidly, especially in urban areas. These trends present challenges to the role of the public sector and to public health policy. 

USAID's Strategic Objective in health focuses on health sector reform through the development of key policies, systems and tools, and their subsequent application on a pilot basis in two regions of the country. The strategic objective is to increase use of family health services and prevention measures within a supportive policy environment. 

The Mission's strategic objective program in family health is valued at approximately $63 million, and for the past 2 years, has had an annual budget of approximately $7.2 million.  This budget has been complemented by a yearly average of $4 million in Title II for food distribution and other activities related to maternal and child health.  The Mission's Family Health Program currently consists of thirteen activities, including a highly complex $12 million bilateral contract (ending early January 2004) for an integrated family health program and a $5 million social marketing program.  

A Foreign Service National (FSN) Population Health and Nutrition (PHN) Officer is currently the Leader of the FHT. He receives advice from a US Direct Hire General Development Officer (GDO) who will oversee both the health and education portfolios.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Systems Requirements Document (SRD) as well as other related documents via the internet for the NASA Mission Operations Voice Enhancement (MOVE), and solicit responses from interested parties in regard to vendor capability.  These documents are for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.   The goal of the MOVE project is to replace and standardize existing NASA Mission Operations Voice Systems with Commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  This requirement encompasses all NASA centers.  Interested parties are requested to review the posted documents and describe their capability to provide equipment, installation and maintenance in accordance with the draft MOVE schedule as well as provide comment and feedback in regard to feasibility and reasonableness of the requirement as stated.	Respondents are also requested to provide input on specific questions as well as complete a compliance matrix.  The posted documents include the SOW, SRD, a listing of specific questions to industry, a compliance matrix, the Johnson Space Center Control Center Complex Digital Voice Communications Subsystem to Data Distribution and Workstation/Server Platforms Subsystem Interface Control Document, the MOVE Schedule--Summary View and Document 2810.MOVE.	Interested parties are requested to provide a description of their existing or in-development COTS products that are the basis for their potential solution to meeting the requirements.  Information may include brochures, data sheets, and web sites (URLs).   A completed SRD/SOW compliance matrix is also requested.  It is noted that the MOVE SRD contains a robust set of voice system requirements.  Due to the number of NASA sites included in this project and the differences in mission types supported (i.e., manned and unmanned), there are some current capabilities that are unique and known not to be supported by existing vendor products.	For this Request for Information (RFI) the intent has been to include all functional requirements based on the capabilities currently in use at all of the target NASA MOVE sites.  It is fully expected that some of the requirements may not be within the scope of some or all of the current market COTS products.  Responders are requested to review the SOW and SRD and identify those requirements that are not currently provided by their existing and/or planned products and therefore, require additional development.	If alternate, comparable capabilities are available in a COTS product, provide information identifying the alternative capability.  Where possible, a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for this development is requested (see the SRD/SOW compliance Matrix).	As a result of information recieved in response to this RFI, NASA may consider SRD updates that may delete or modify some requirements to achieve maximum competition.   Due to the nature of this acquisition that involves multiple NASA centers and many team members, respondents are asked to submit technical questions in writing to MOVE@ncc-comm.gsfc.nasa.gov.  The MOVE team, comprised of both Government and Contractor personnel will review and respond to all questions, and review the RFI responses.  Both respondent questions and MOVE team answers will be posted via the World Wide Web at the NASA/GSFC business opportunity homepage.  The web link is cited below.	Center technical contacts are:  Dan Duffy, MOVE Project Manager, GSFC at 301-286-5110, Douglas Fooshee, MOVE Deputy Project Manager and MSFC lead at 256-544-3297, Michael Johnson, GSFC lead at 301-286-7574, William Allen (Al) Wylie, JSC lead at 281-483-4738, Timothy Springstroh, KSC Lead at 321-867-4113, Gerald Humphrey, JPL Lead at 818-354-3094, Tuan Doan, Hanger AE, Lead at 321-853-9742 and Michael Yettaw, DFRC Lead at 661-276-3253.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Klaus D. Sexton, Contracting Officer at 301-286-2271.  Electronic submission is encouraged. Responses to this RFI are to be forwarded to NASA/GSFC ATTN: Klaus.D.Sexton, Code 210.4, Bldg. 12 Room E206B, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt MD, 20771.

<DESC>The Internal Service is interested in acquiring, for test and evaluation purposes, commercial, off-the-shelf open architecture financial data sharing/searching systems based on the SEC’s EDGAR system.  The systems should include, but not be limited to SEC filings, Foreign Government Filings, Press Releases, Analysts Reports, company organization charts, ratio analysis and charts.  These will be used by Researchers, Economists, International, and Revenue Agents within the Large and Mid-Size Business (LMSB) IRS Business Unit for an evaluation period of 120 days.  We expect that contractors furnishing systems for trial would have significant experience in the design, development, and application of the financial database software functionalities required for this project; possess in-depth knowledge regarding the analytical processes and data presentation issues; and have intimate knowledge of SEC filings and financial ratio analysis and graphic comparative analysis of corporations’ structures.

<DESC>The mining industry has been experiencing a number of accidents and injuries associated with the operation of remote control mining machines in underground mines.  These are typically crushing or pinning type accidents that occur when the operator of the remote controls gets caught between the machine and the mine walls when the machine unexpectedly or suddenly moves.  
 
The Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking manufacturers of established technology that can be adapted to underground continuous mining machines to detect the presence of nearby personnel and provide warning signals and cause machine shutdown when personnel are located within the machine’s danger zone.  With this notice, MSHA wishes to identify suitable companies with which MSHA could partner to develop proximity shutdown systems.  Once an applicable system(s) is(are) identified, MSHA will coordinate product development with a suitable continuous mining machine manufacturer and mine operator for eventual field testing.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information - Standard Database Solution
<DESC>Request for Information for a Standardized Database Solution for Converting Microsoft Access Databases 

 
1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a two phased solution to convert, store, manipulate and report data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database, and report data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders to be integrated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Operating Platform located at the data hosting center in St. Louis, Missouri.  The database will support users from multiple departments within TSA. Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on June 4, 2004.  See section 8.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Transportation Security Administration, at the request of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and in support the OIT goals  to design, deploy, maintain and enhance the information technology essential for TSA to protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people; is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a standardized, enterprise database solution. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Conceptual technical architecture alternatives for a solution that will:
 
•	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into a standardized database.
•	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized database.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (including MS Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders. 

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for the Standardized Database Solution. TSA requires the conversion of existing operational Access databases to a stable, readily managed, multi-user environment to best support their day-to-day operations. The end state environment required is the target Oracle platform shared by TSA and DHS.  TSA has immediate needs to access and manage critical data during conversion with no operational downtime, and reach the end state Oracle environment in the quickest and most cost-effective manner.  An intermediate database environment would be acceptable while transitioning to Oracle, provided TSA’s data accessibility is not interrupted and this approach meets the business needs of TSA in a cost-effective manner.






TSA’s Office of Information Technology requires the ability to store, manipulate, and report unclassified yet sensitive data.  These capabilities are required short term to quickly support users from multiple departments within TSA using a standard data dictionary.

•	The Standardized Database Solution will eliminate redundant efforts (i.e., less employee time spent developing across the enterprise).
•	The Standardized Database Solution will be hosted in a central location, such as TSA’s hosting center that allows for 24 x 7 support and fault tolerance, depending upon the build, with a dedicated Database Administrator (DBA) to ease management and trouble-shooting of all applications.

TSA’s long term requirements involve the ability to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.  This solution will:

&#61599;	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (Including Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders.

Other requirements not directly related to database architecture will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, service level agreements, and other important considerations.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.


4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

The Standardized Database Solution will meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

The following parameters should be considered when developing a solution to TSA’s database conversion and management requirements:
&#61599;	Grouping TSA conversions in order to fully utilize economy of scale.
&#61599;	Eliminating database redundancies in TSA offices to minimize the number of conversions and subsequent data maintenance activities.
&#61599;	A transitional approach, initially converting TSA databases quickly to a less complex but stable multiple user’s environment to satisfy immediate customer needs.
&#61599;	Single server for all TSA conversions to consolidate and organize these databases for more orderly follow-on conversions or add-ons.
&#61599;	A two-phase solution:  
&#61599;	Phase 1- converting unclassified yet sensitive data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database at a TSA specified data hosting facility.
&#61599;	Phase 2  - creating a long-term solution to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.


5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 – Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for the Standardized Database Solution, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the solution to be hosted by a third party. (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram of the hosting site  identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed).

Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  The costs will include required hardware and software purchases, design and development costs, as well as maintenance and operational support needs. Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)








Section 4 – Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (There is no suggested page count)

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  

Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.


Section 5 – Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

<SUBJECT>76-- License for Human Protein Reference Database
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD for a license to use, incorporate, and distribute data from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD).  The HPRD is a data resource of protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, enzyme-substrate relationships and disease associations.  The information has been derived by experts using bioinformatics analytic tools but principally from a critical reading and review of the peer-reviewed journal literature.  The annotations for individual proteins identifies the types of protein interactions, the regions of interaction, the types of experiments showing modification of substrates by enzymes, the analysis of motifs and domains, and subcellular localization.  HPRD uses a controlled vocabulary which facilitates interoperability and common search interfaces.  The data are available in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) which preserves the hierarchical structure of the database during the import/export of data.  The purpose of this acquisition is to enhance the current content of databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the NLM.  NCBI produces and distributes through its RefSeq database, an information resource of integrated, non-redundant, and highly annotated sequence data for genomic DNA, transcripts, and protein products from major research organisms.  Through licensing HPRD data, NCBI will be able to significantly enhance the annotation of functional information for human proteins within RefSeq.  HPRD information will be a valuable addition to the RefSeq database since it currently does not cover in depth protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, enzyme/substrate relationships, curated domain predictions, tissue distribution, subcellular localization and disease associations.  There are currently over 6500 proteins annotated in HPRD with an additional 3000 expected within the next 10 months.  There are over 12,000 protein-protein interactions annotated and over 100,000 links to journal literature in PubMed. Updating and creation of new entries occurs on a continuing basis; all data developed and revised shall be made available for electronic transfer to NCBI on a daily basis.  The content of the HPRD database is copyrighted by the Johns Hopkins University and use of the data will be purchased as a commercial item subject to a non-exclusive licensing agreement.  Because of the comprehensiveness of the data and the thoroughness of its annotation, and because the Johns Hopkins University owns the rights to the data, it has been determined that the University of Washington is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM’s requirements.  The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within twenty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>D -- NIH 104 Paging Network
<SOLNBR>04-135
<RESPDATE>052804
<ARCHDATE>06122004
<CONTACT>Michael Kapsilis, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 496-6546, Fax (301) 402-0642, Email kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  The Center for Information Technology (CIT) has requested the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate a sole source, brand name only basis purchase requirement with Turn-Key Technologies, Inc. (TTI) for acquisition of products and services for the NIH 104 Paging Network.  This procurement will be performed as a small business set-aside.

TTI shall provide CIT a total system replacement, with upgrades and expansions of the currently existing 104 Paging Network.  The 104 Paging Network is a dual channel, government owned, operated system that has been maintained and supported by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) Division of Network Systems and Telecommunications (DNST).  The network presently provides one-way voice and display messaging to more than 5,000 NIH IC customers.  A priority service function includes coverage for Clinical Center Code Blue emergencies.  The Network is designed for IC usage within the NIH campus with up to a 50-mile coverage radius for on-call and emergency personnel.  

The paging system is a mandated narrowband conversion required by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  Narrowband channel assignments explained in Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.7 & 4.3.7A and Chapter 5, Section 5.3.5.2 of the NTIA Manual of Regulations & Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management.  All systems in the 162-174 MHz band must conform to these narrowband standards effective January 1, 2005.   The availability of narrowband equipment manufactures is extremely limited due to the frequency band (162-174MHz) for government operations.

The Center for Information Technology has determined that the Enterprise model paging terminal system solution provided by TTI for the 104 Paging Network is uniquely qualified to meet the government’s minimum requirements.  Market research and analysis determined that TTI’s approach for the paging system will provide the best value to the Government.  The Government has determined that the Enterprise model paging terminal provided by TTI used within the NIH 104 Paging system as stated below provides the following functionalities required to meet CIT’s minimum requirements:

1.	The Enterprise series paging solution is the only system that provides a Multitone FLA four line alphanumeric display pagers, with a complete Turn-key solution from design, implementation, integration, installation, optimization, to post installation support device.
2.	The Enterprise series paging terminal is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act by providing emergency notification for both hearing impaired and visually impaired individuals through unique text to voice and large font pagers.
3.	The Solution provides a standby terminal with automatic switchover in event of failure.  No human intervention is required.
4.	It has a fully customized remote switching capability for transmitters and is fully synchronized with GPS-controlled simulcast transmitter controllers.
5.	The solution provides expandability to additional locations anywhere in the world through TNPP interfacing.
6.	TTI’s system offers a direct interface into fire alarm panels for automatic notifications to key personnel and visually and hearing impaired.
7.	The solution has numerous levels of redundancy and fail-safes and it can withstand multiple failures of different inputs and still provide alternative paths for sending critical messages.
8.	The Enterprise system provides multiple priority levels for messages to insure emergency calls go out without delay and repeat call capability for critical messages (such as code blue).
9.	Full system statistics and reports are featured, as well as remote programming and diagnostics.
10.	24/7 by 365 day support from TTI Help Desk and 24/7 by 365 day three-hour response time for on-site field service.  In addition, a full service and repair facility is provided.

TTI is the exclusive manufacturer and distributor of the Enterprise Series Paging Terminals.  The Enterprise Series is not available from any other source.  TTI is also the exclusive US importer and distributor of the Multitone Electronic paging equipment, including the NTIA-approved line of narrow band pagers.  TTI has been working as Multitone’s United States distributor for 12 years.  TTI also is the only factory authorized repair and support facility in the USA for the complete line of Multitone products.

These reasons combined with an aggressive time line of sixty to ninety days for equipment production, installation, migration (existing to new) and testing provide the final critical element of this acquisition for the Clinical Research Center, with a scheduled occupancy of September 1, 2004.  Expansion of this system is critical to the occupancy of the 900,000 square foot Clinical Research Center.  Another critical factor is the emergency nature of the communications provided and Hospital Code Blue emergencies.  Additionally, the expansion of the paging network equipment is necessary to encompass the additional radio frequency coverage area of the center.

The equipment and services will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ). Companies interested in responding to this brand name only requirement must submit a quote within seven (7) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-135 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael G. Kapsilis, Contract Specialist, (301) 496-6546 kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is NOT set aside for small business.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Offer (RFO) for: Item 1) one Antenna Upgrade including Software Support and Maintenance, Item 2) one set of documentation and Item 3) Training and Checkout of the Upgraded System. The Contractor shall perform the upgrade in accordance with the following specifications. Near-Field Antenna Range Facility Description The existing GRC near-field range was intended to characterize very large (e.g. greater than 2 meter diameter) antennas and was used to support the Advanced Communication Technology Satellite project some 12 years ago. Much of the original equipment is no longer supported by the OEM. GRC needs to reestablish this capability to address a new mission class involving very large (e.g. greater than 4 meter diameter) inflatable membrane antennas. GRC intends to establish a state-of-the-art facility using as much of the existing hardware as possible.  Recently, GRC initiated a new project to develop large inflatable membrane antennas and anticipates delivery of the first 4 X 6 meter antenna in November, 2004. Subsequently, building 77 was targeted for rehab which will commence in August, 2004 and take several months to complete. GRC needs to have the near-field range readied before the building rehab starts. That means the range upgrade needs to be completed on or about the first week of August 2004. The GRC planar near-field antenna facility test volume envelope is approximately 40¡¦ „e 40¡¦ and 60¡¦ in height. The dimensions of the vertical scan plane are 22¡¦ „e 22¡¦ which defines the size of the largest antenna that can be measured. The antenna under test (AUT) is mounted to an azimuth over elevation positioner that has a vertical load capacity of 30,000 lbs. A typical test uses the AUT as the transmit antenna and a rectangular waveguide as the receiving probe antenna. The aperture field of the AUT is sampled by performing a raster scan of horizontal steps and continuous vertical movement at each step. The position of the probe at each data point is determined with a laser interferometer system. An Agilent 8510C network analyzer is used as the receiver for this range. Measurements are currently performed over a 4 to 40 GHz frequency range. The microwave signal is generated in the range at the AUT. A reference signal is coupled from the microwave input to the AUT and down-converted to a 20 MHz intermediate frequency. The received signal from the probe is also down-converted as the test channel of the receiver. To minimize local oscillator (LO) phase changes and the weight of the cable as the probe is repositioned, the LO is provided via a fiber optic link from the control room, which houses the experiment motion control and data processing software.  Required Tasks 1.	The Contractor shall provide planar data acquisition and processing software. The software shall control all system operations including RF equipment and positioners, provide on-the-fly position correction, and probe pattern file correction. Software support and maintenance shall be included with the software. (The Contractor shall specify the period of time they will provide software support and maintenance.) 2.	The Contractor shall upgrade the existing GRC near-field scanner which includes the following: a.	replace existing servos in XY scanner with stepper motor control b.	ensure limit switches are working properly (and repair/replace if not) c.	provide a system controller and measurement workstation d.	interface to existing XY laser system. e.	interface to existing Agilent 8510C measurement system 3.	The Contractor will utilize the existing GRC laser for probe position verification. 4.	The Contractor shall install a probe roll stage (360 degree rotation) with a 50 GHz rotary joint. The motor cable length is approximately 75 feet. 5.	The Contractor shall perform the upgrade installation at NASA GRC.  6.   The Contractor shall perform training of the upgraded system including the software operation for up to 4 GRC staff members.  This training shall be completed within 10 days of completion of the installation.   7.   The Contractor shall verify upgraded near-field system operation during the training period using a NASA GRC provided 0.3 m parabolic antenna. 8.   One copy of documentation for all software and hardware furnished for the upgrade. Schedule The Contractor shall perform all of these tasks prior to August 6, 2004.  The effort shall be performed Monday thru Friday, non-government holidays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or per other mutually agreeable times. Solicitation Instructions The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-21.  The NAIC code is 334519 and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center is required by August 6, 2004.

Offeror must submit a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) for each year and a cumulative FFP total for all years. 6. Statement of Work. Project Objective: The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) is required to maintain their ambient PM2.5 monitoring network according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations as detailed in 40 CFR Parts 50, 53, and 58. To accomplish this goal, contractor support is essential. The data derived from the ambient PM2.5 monitoring network include both aerosol mass measurements and chemically-resolved or speciated data. Mass measurements are used principally for PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) comparison purposes in identifying areas that meet or do not meet PM2.5 NAAQS, and in supporting designation as attainment or non-attainment. The Indiana FRM  network consists of forty (40) sites located throughout the State of Indiana. Indiana uses Rupprecht & Patashnick (R&P) Partisol Model 2025 sequential samplers to collect PM2.5 concentrations to determine compliance with the NAAQS. Thirty-eight (38) sites operate once every three (3) days and one (1) site which operates once every six (6) days. Fifteen (15) percent of these sites are co-located with another FRM sampler. The co-located sites operate once every six (6) days. Two (2) FRM sites may be added during the current contract period. The Indiana continuous PM2.5 mass monitoring network consists of nine (9) sites located at Washington Park (18-097-0078) In Indianapolis, 2022 N. Beacon St. in Fort Wayne (18-003-0004), the Childrens’ Hospital in South Bend (18-141-1008), Terre Haute (18-167-0018) and Evansville (18-163-0012), Hammond (18-089-2004), Gary (18-089-0022), New Albany (18-043-1004), and Ogden Dunes (18-127-0024. Indiana uses the R&P Model 1400ab Tapered Element Oscillating Monitor (TEOM) with the Filter Dynamics Monitoring System (FDMS) at all five (5) sites.  Indiana plans to expand the continuous monitoring network by five (5) sites during the contract period. The new monitoring locations will be in Anderson (18-095-0009), Bloomington, Lafayette (18-157-0008), Indianapolis (18-097-0081) and Southwest Purdue Ag Center (18-083-0004). The Indiana PM2.5 speciation network currently consists of seven (7) sites. The PM2.5 trends speciation site is located at Washington Park in Indianapolis (18-097-0078) and operates once every three (3)  days, the sites which operate every six (6) days include Mechanicsburg (18-065-0003, Evansville site (18-163-0012), Fort Wayne (18-003-0004), Gary (18-089–0022), Hamond (18-089-2004), and South Bend (18-141-1008). Indiana uses MET ONE monitors in their PM2.5 speciation network. The sampling schedule for the PM2.5 speciation network coincides with the sampling schedule for the FRM network. In addition to this, Indiana is working with EPA and R&P in conducting beta testing on the new R&P continuous PM2.5 speciation analyzers. These units measure nitrate, sulfate, and carbon and are located at the Washington Park site.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 03 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 20K CRYOGENIC COOLING SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions and a confirmation received at the site visit on May 20, 2004. Question:  Is there a facility plan drawing for the new refrigerator location?	 Answer:  See drawing posted with this amendment (03). Question:  What is the (door) roll-up door size and of the 10K room and outside door?  Answer:  Both doors are 25ft. wide and min. 35 feet tall. Confirmation: Floor shroud section has to be able to move independently from the table and from the last shroud section.  Must be offloaded afterwards to shroud and 1” rail system.  The floor shroud can roll in and out with the optics bench but would be required to be offloaded once in position.    If the 2” rail system is used for the floor carrier, it must be offloaded to either the 1” rails or some other feature to reduce vibration in the 2 inch rail system.  The optics will be mounted to the 2” rail system and Helium flow thru the shroud floor could cause a problem. Question:  Access Route- Handling equipment available-smallest door/opening  we must go through to get to chamber?  Answer:  The door is 25 feet wide and 35 feet tall Question:  What is the location of the Shroud Re-assembly and cleaning prep????   Answer:The shoud re-assembly shall be performed under the canopy on the East side of the 10K clean room.  A welder plug is available and this area is covered. We will have the area pressure washed before arrival of your hardware. Question:  Point of receipt at loading dock-what handling equipment available?	 Answer:  A 20 Ton sissor lift unloading dock is available.  The dimensions are 10 W x 20 L.  We	have a 3600lb. forklift for this operation and	a forklift in the 10K clean room. Once in the 1000k clean room the 20 ton overhead bridge crane will be available. Question:  Why is the shroud flat on top?   Answer:  Our shroud requirements did not specify the shroud would be flat at the top.  Our concept picture shows the shroud flat to provide a mounting surface to the I-beam in the top of the chamber.  This concept is only for demonstration of the concept and by no means dictates the final design. If the panels are round instead of square the flat surface is not required.  We have to access lifting points on the top of our existing shroud which makes a flat top required for access to the lifting fixture.  The new shroud requirement will not have lifting eyes at the top of the shroud. Question:  Who cleaned your existing shrouds after deliver?  Answer:  A local contractor named Micro Craft provided PSI cleaning services.  Another company onsite “ASRI” also provides these services. Question:  Is the helium tank provided?   Answer:  No, the tank should be provided as part of the refrigerator system.   MSFC will provide the Helium to fill the tank. Question:  Can the existing helium tank feed both refrigerators?   Answer:  This is a question for the refrigerator vendor but I assume a new tank will be necessary. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 27, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

Delivery on August 5, 2004 is CRITICAL since there is only one barge a year that transports materials to Kalaupapa, Hawaii.

Final inspection and acceptance of materials by the Government will occur when materials arrive in Kalaupapa.  The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition and are available at www.arnet.gov:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions of Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions, FAR 52.211-11 Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development (Sept 2000) (a) If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, in place of actual damages, pay to the Government liquidated damages of $300 per calendar day of delay.  (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part under the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause, the Contractor is liable for liquidated damages accruing until the Government reasonably obtains delivery or performance of similar supplies or services. These liquidated damages are in addition to excess costs of repurchase under the Termination clause. (c) The Contractor will not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay in delivery or performance is beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined in the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause in this contract.

Evaluation of Commercial Items:  The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposal submission:  (1) At least three or more previous experiences with shipping materials to Hawaii; (2) Lead time needed to purchase and ship materials, confirmation of the critical delivery of materials to Honolulu and Young Brothers by August 5, 2004; and the Offeror's ability to meet that date; (3) Capability to store materials in Honolulu identifying available storage facilities; and (4) transportation capability of delivery to Young Brothers for barge transport.  The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be based on best value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  As the technical merit and evaluated cost or price becomes essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.  The Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.  Proposals shall be submitted in an original and three copies by no later than 12:00 p.m. on June 1, 2004 to:  Historic Preservation Training Center, 4801A Urbana Pike, Frederick, Maryland  21704.

Confirm your understanding of the consequences of failure to meet the delivery date based on the Liquidated Damages Clause, and the requirement for the Contractor to incur the cost of alternative means of transportation if materials do not arrive in time. (3) The capability to store materials in Honolulu by identifying available storage facilities; and (4)  Identify transportation capability of delivery to Young Brothers for barge transport.  Business Management Cost Proposal:  (1)  Individual descriptions of materials with unit price and total prices for each identified material.

<DESC>Amendment 0003

The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.

The due date for quotations, Tuesday, May 25, 2004 at 3:00 PM local time, remains unchanged by reason of this amendment.

QUESTION: Specification (8): Tested and certified as an IP-3 Package per IAEA ST-1.
We can not locate a reference to IP-3 Tests in the ST-1.  
What paragraphs from 713 through 737 under test for packages apply?
RESPONSE:  The following paragraphs from IAEA Safety Standards "Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material 1996 Edition (Revised)" No. TS-R-1 (ST-1, Revised), International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna 2000:
Paragraph numbers 310, 606, 608 - 613, 615, 634 - 639, 642, 643, 646, 647, 701, 702, 713 - 717, 719 - 724 apply to all radioactive materials transportation packages or specifically to Type IP-3 packages.
Paragraph numbers 719 - 724 refer to the specific test requirements for normal conditions of transport for an IP-3 package. The equivalent paragraphs in the 1985 Edition of ST-1 for these same test requirements for normal conditions of transport are Paragraph numbers 619 - 624.

QUESTION:  The IP-3 information in the 49 CFR, Paragraph 173.411 leads to 173.412, to 173.465 (Type A), to 173.466. The Liquid Drop Test is a 30 feet drop test.
RESPONSE:  NIST understands this as an interpretive problem. The key is that 173.411 directs you to 173.412(a) through 173.412(j). STOP-do NOT continue with 173.412(k)and 173.412(l); they apply specifically to Type A packages designed for liquids or gases, NOT for Industrial Packages. 

49CFR173.412(j) does direct you to 49CFR173.461(a) and to 49CFR173.465; it does NOT direct you to 49CFR173.466 which specifies the additional test requirements for Type A packaging designed for liquids.

Nowhere within 173.465 does it specifically direct you to 173.466. The 30 foot drop test does NOT apply to IP-3 packages designed for liquids. Per the IAEA's ST-1, the 30 foot drop test is a demonstration of the package's ability to withstand accident conditions in transport.

The IP-3 does not have to withstand accident conditions in transport, only the test requirements as specified in Paragraph numbers 719 - 724 (1996 Edition, Revised), for normal conditions in transport.

Note: The specified drop height of 1.2 meters may be adjusted to a higher drop height to compensate for a test liquid with a lower density than the density that the container is being certified (by testing) to carry. For example, a drum to be embossed for liquids of density of 1.2 may be drop tested while filled with a liquid of density of 1.0 and while adjusting the drop test height to 1.5 meters instead of 1.2 meters; see United Nations (UN) "Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods", Eleventh Revised Edition 1999, paragraph 6.1.5.3.4

QUESTION:  Specification (9.) Embossing per UN Requirements.  Is the heavy water shipped under DOT 7A or under UN, per the Department of Transportation?
RESPONSE:  The embossing (marking in a permanent manner) is a means to readily identify like containers (drums) that have all been manufactured to a design standard. 

Therefore, all containers (drums) which bear those same permanent markings can be said to meet a test requirement if a representative sample of that same design type 
was tested and the test results were documented. Documented verification that containers are of the same design type (by certifying the embossing), together with satisfactory 
QA inspection results, would allow the use of like containers for that same purpose for which the representative sample(s) were tested. 

For example, if a representative sample of a particular design type were satisfactorily tested as conforming to IP-3 package performance standards, then like packages with the same embossing could be used as IP-3, provided the test conditions (gross package weight, maximum liquid density) were not exceeded. 
Answer to the above question of whether the packages (containers together with their contents) will be "shipped under DOT 7A or under UN":  DOT 7A is a 49CFR package design specification for a Type A package, which for liquids would require conformance to the performance standards in 49CFR173.466, a satisfactory
drop test from 30 feet.  That 30 foot drop test is a far more rigorous requirement than the 4 foot (1.2 meter) drop test required for an IP-3 package. Can you find test results for a 55-gal drum filled with liquid, dropped from 30 feet onto an unyielding surface, that retained all of its contents?  US DOT regulations do allow for the use of an IP-3 package for the non-exclusive use transport of LSA-II liquids, however that is irrelevant as we are shipping in accordance with the IAEA regulations, not US DOT regulations. There are some differences, but they are related to aspects of shipment other than the IP-3 package requirements.

For this procurement we are specifying drums, which together with their test documentation, are certified by the vendor as IP-3 packages.

We are specifying drums which have been embossed according to the UN codes; for reference, these codes are also defined in 49CFR178.500 through 178.504

QUESTION: Specification (8.) According to the 49 CFR testing information, the suggested media for testing material with a specific gravity of 1.2 or less is water.
RESPONSE:  Yes, you can test for a liquid with specific gravity of 1.2 by using water.

One way would be to dissolve sufficient solute until the density equaled 1.2, or a better way might be to adjust the drop test height to 1.5 meters instead of 1.2 meters, as allowed by United Nations (UN) "Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods", Eleventh Revised Edition 1999, paragraph 6.1.5.3.4 (See response to the 1st question, above).

QUESTION:  Using 8.3 lbs./gallon, a 55 gallon drum would contain approximately 457 lbs. The requested test in Specification 8 is approximately 485 lbs.
RESPONSE:  For a drum with nominal capacity of 208 liters, the actual capacity when filled to overflow is approximately 218 liters, so subtracting 10% for ullage (void volume), this leaves approximately 196.2 liters (218 - 21.8).  196.2 liters x 1.2 density equals 235.44 kg (519 lbs).

NIST’s procurement specification requires a net test weight of greater than or equal to 220 kg (485 lbs), so any drum embossed greater than or equal to 1.2 for the maximum relative density will meet that requirement, as long as the net test weight is greater than or equal to 220 kg.

QUESTION: What is specific gravity of the material going into the drum? 
RESPONSE: Assume it is 1.2, as specified in the procurement.

QUESTION: If it is 1.2 or less how do we reconcile the test weight for the UN marking?
RESPONSE:  See the previous response.  220 kg net test weight for density of 1.0 yields a fill volume of 220 liters, which would exceed the overflow capacity, so this would indicate that you have to test with a liquid of greater than 1.0 density, BUT for the drop test, you can test with density of 1.0 instead of density of 1.2 by adjusting the drop test height to 1.5 meters instead of 1.2 meters, as allowed by United Nations (UN) "Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods", Eleventh Revised Edition 1999, paragraph 6.1.5.3.4.
For the stacking test, you could just add the appropriate additional mass to the stack. 

For either test, you do not have to test with liquid density of greater than 1.0. 

QUESTION:  If it is greater than 1.2, we need to know what the specific gravity is to establish the test parameters.
RESPONSE:  Assume that the liquid that we want to ship in these drums could range up to a density of 1.2.  That doesn't disqualify drums which have UN embossings for relative densities of greater than 1.2.  

They could go as high as 1.9 or even greater, that is just the design type permanent markings (embossings) by which the drums were certified for the transport of generic non-radioactive hazardous liquids by the UN. The IP-3 test requirements are independent of those non-radioactive liquid test requirements.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions received regarding this RFQ and answers to those questions for potential offerors to consider in constructing their response to this RFQ.  QUESTION 1: What are the applications? Is this exclusively for TEM or would other capabilities of Broad Beam Ion Milling be of interest?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 1: TEM sample preparation is the main purpose.  If another product meets or exceeds RFQ specifications and has additional capabilities (that don't detract from TEM sample preparation), then NIST will consider an offer for such a product.  QUESTION 2: What materials are being milled?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 2: NIST prepares a wide variety of materials for both plan-view and cross-section TEM: metals, ceramics, and semiconductors, bulk materials, thin films on substrates, electrically conductive (and non-conductive), etc.  QUESTION 3: Are there any materials that cannot be handled by conventional ion milling systems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 3: Based on NIST's understanding of the question, we believe the answer is no to this question.  QUESTION 4: What is the application for Chemical Etching (CAIBE)? Would other methods of achieving the same results be acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 4: CAIBE is intended to remove surface damage that remains even after low voltage, low angle, and low beam current milling has been used to prepare a sample.  NIST would consider an offer for other methods that will achieve the required results.  The offerror shall clearly describe exactly how their offered product performs this function if such an alternative is offered.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2:
Question 1:Please advise ambient temperature conditions for A/C Heating operation?
Answer 1: Extreme operating temperatures for cooling are Southwest Asia in the summer months and local North Carolina area in the summer months.  The same areas apply to the heating capacity for the winter months.
Question 2:  Please clarify cooling capacity of the A/C; 6 tons or 28,800 BTU.
