<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with V-Soft Inc., 6455 East Johns Crossing, Duluth, GA 30097 for the requirements specified herein under the authority provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b), as the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  SSA currently utilizes CHEX-RPS, a proprietary remittance processing software, provided by V-Soft under a previous contractual vehicle.  SSA now has a requirement to purchase the services of V-Soft to provide enhancements to the remittance processing system.  This consists of the licenses and/or installation of the following as well as Disaster Recovery services to enable SSA to test a back-up remittance processing system that mimics the in-service system:  (1) eDesk Research – a new research tool that would replace the current CD-Rom method of archiving and retrieval.  This tool allows users from different geographic locations to access the remittance archive.  The archive would house images of remittances processed over several years, and would be populated by images of items from the current remittance operation.  (2) eDesk Returns – software that modernizes the processing requirements for bounced checks.  This product has the capability to automatically search for the processed check in archives, identify the account to which it was posted, send notices and reverse the credit.  (3) eDesk Intelligent Repair Image System (IRIS) – software that will automatically repair rejected items during image capture, using advanced character-recognition technology.  (4) eDesk Returns (Checks 21) – software that will assist in the processing of remittance items that are returned by the federal reserve bank when the accounts on which funds are drawn contain non-sufficient funds.  The contractor shall install and test new operating software (to be supplied by SSA) and integrate above itemized enhancements.  The contractor shall also install all itemized enhancements and operating system upgrades on a new server (to be supplied by SSA).  Final enhancements will reside on a server to be located at the SSA Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center (MATPSC) in Philadelphia, PA.  The contractor shall provide training for the enhancements to MATPSC personnel, telephone support, and associated maintenance/warranty for a twelve month period from date of acceptance.  Disaster recovery may take place at the Contractor’s facility, MATPSC, and/or an off-site location in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The period of performance for services described herein shall be 12 months, exclusive of the warranty period.  V-Soft Inc. is the only known source capable of satisfying SSA’s requirements.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data (including GSA Schedule information).  Pricing data may be submitted.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources.  Responses to this notice should be submitted by September 13, 2004 3:00 pm. Eastern Time and should refer to VSOFTCS0904.  The size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual email message.  If after September 13, 2004 no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, SSA shall initiate negotiations solely with V-Soft, Inc.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified small businesses capable of performing education and training services for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). FSIS requires contractual support services to develop training and education courses covering scientific, public health, management and regulatory topics that are tailored to the needs of FSIS. The training and education services would fall into the following general categories: 1) Develop public health education and training programs that are linked to widely accepted public health credentials; 2) Develop courses covering Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) technical and regulatory approaches; 3) Develop courses targeted to meet the needs of all occupational groups within the Agency; and 4) When requested, provide subject matter experts to deliver classroom courses to the FSIS workforce. The classroom courses must be tailored to meet the needs of FSIS and focused on public health curriculum. In most cases, they must be available to the Agency’s geographically dispersed workforce at or near the worksite. Small businesses having the capabilities necessary to provide the described services are invited to submit appropriate documentation which will demonstrate that it has the ability to perform this service. This information will allow the Government to determine whether small business concerns can satisfy the Government's requirement and whether the procurement should be set-aside for small businesses. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6 million in average annual receipts. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. The Government is not requesting technical/management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice. Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender. A draft RFP will be released on or about September 1 for industry comment. All comments must be received by the same date and time indicated for the sources sought response. If a final solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. Interested small businesses are requested to submit a package delineating qualifications, capabilities, and experience for meeting the range of services described herein.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – Office for Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) seek sources for commercial personal protective equipment (PPE).  Product information will be used to revise and update the existing Guide for the Selection of Personal Protective Equipment for Emergency Responders, DHS (formerly NIJ) Guide 102-00 published in November 2002.  The products are intended to protect emergency responders and other users from a wide variety of hazardous situations to include terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  

This Sources Sought Request addresses personal protective ensembles and equipment to include protective garments, suits, hoods, gloves, and footwear.  It does not address CBRN respiratory protective equipment, which has been covered in a separate notice.  

The threat environments include chemical, biological, radiological, thermal, and explosive.  The emergency response duty areas requiring PPE include law enforcement, fire service, emergency medical service, follow-on responders, and special operations.  More information and guidance can be found in the 2004 Standardized Equipment List (SEL) developed and released by the Interagency Board for Equipment Standardization and Interoperability (IAB) at http://www.iab.gov.  

In PPE categories where performance standards exist, submitters should limit their candidates to those ensembles and components certified to those standards.  For this Guide, applicable standards would include National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.  However, submitters are also requested to provide product information on PPE manufactured from materials and technologies such as semi-permeable and carbon based systems, for which performance based standards do not currently exist.  

For these products, submitters should include information on any standards (such as military specifications or industrial specifications) against which the product has been successfully tested.  The Government will review the manufacturer's specifications to determine eligibility for inclusion in the revised Guide.  

SUBMISSION OF DATA:  Product information submitted in response to this notice must be submitted to the Responder Knowledge Base (RKB), where it will be kept on-line for access by the responder community.  Submitters should contact Lesley Zareh (see below), and will be provided with instructions and administrative access to the RKB for the purpose of data submission and maintenance.  The RKB is available on-line at http://www.rkb.mipt.org.  

This survey announcement is intended to identify existing mature products (commercial off-the-shelf).  Interested sources shall ensure that their information is submitted on-line no later than thirty (30) days after this posting.  NOTE:  Eligible products that have already been submitted to the RKB will automatically be included in the eligibility determination process for the revised Guide.  However, vendors should check existing records for accuracy and completeness prior to the submission deadline.
