<DESC>General Services Administration, Federal Technology (GSA/FTS), Region 5 is announcing its intent to award this procurement as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial products and services. This notice is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and supplemented with additional information included herein. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested. A written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP); solicitation number GS05T02BMM2805, which incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2001-6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 applies. Size standard is $21 Million. This requirement is to provide technical support for the development of some initial implementations of MOVES; the contractor shall provide software development support services. Background: As part of the Office of Air and Radiation, EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) administers portions of Title II of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 and 1990.  Within OTAQ, the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) does a wide range of work in support of EPA's efforts in air quality analysis.  These efforts include creating and revising emissions estimation tools, developing regulatory impact analyses, testing vehicles, supporting the vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and other related projects. OTAQ's current series of air emission estimation models are based on MOBILE6:  MOBILE6.0 - A basic version of the model used to estimate emissions of HC, CO, and NOx.  MOBILE6.1 An enhanced version of MOBILE to estimate emissions of particulate matter, gaseous SO2, and ammonia. MOBILE6.2 - A version of MOBILE enhanced to estimate emissions of a variety of air toxic compounds. MOBILE6.3 - A version of MOBILE enhanced to estimate emissions of the "green-house" gas CO2.  Estimation of CO2 implies that this version of MOBILE will also estimate vehicle fuel economy. Additional conceptual software design work has been undertaken including: Top-Level documentation of the approximately 20 "Use Cases" the new generation of mobile source models is intended to eventually fulfill.  A partial, preliminary software design as represented in "NGM Object Oriented Design" revision 5 of which was produced by Cimulus, Inc on November 30, 2001.  This design focuses on the "core" vehicle activity and emission result calculation aspects of the model in a generic fashion. A top-level identification of the software classes and graphical user interface (gui) characteristics that would be needed to fully support the use cases. (This information is available in documents entitled EPA's plan is to design and code MOVES in-house with contractor assistance.  MOVES represent EPA's collective integrated knowledge of mobile source emissions.  The process of designing and coding MOVES is primarily a process of assembling, evaluating, integrating, and rigorously formalizing our understanding of mobile source emissions.  This is a process that only EPA can undertake.   EPA can, however, contract for assistance with the nuts and bolts of software design and coding.  This contract is intended to provide EPA with that assistance. EPA's software development paradigm is iterative.  We plan to program one use case at a time, and add functionality with each release.  The advantage is that we are not wasting time and money designing things that will have radically changed by the time we get to them.  The risk is that a near-term programming decision may interfere with the future coding of a use case that we have not adequately designed for.  We minimize that risk by creating a high-level overall design that includes everything we expect to develop and be flexible.  We design in detail only the next release.  That way, we do not spend too much time on things that will change anyway, but we lower our risk of having trouble doing something that we want to do later.  The risk is additionally lowered by the practice of refactoring (reworking code as needed).  Refactoring, in turn, is supported by the concurrent development and maintenance of test suites for all classes, packages, and the program as a whole.  Description: The objective of this project is to provide technical support for the development of some initial implementations of MOVES.  This technical support has four objectives: 1.  Help EPA/OTAQ to complete, document, and operate an initial "infrastructure" for development of the MOVES software and to advise EPA/OTAQ regarding the further evolution of this infrastructure to meet the needs of the MOVES project as it progresses. 2.  Work with EPA to produce a software design for MOVES which: 3.  Use the MOVES design and the software development infrastructure to produce and test initial implementations of the new generation model.  4.  Advise, assist, and provide training to OTAQ staff regarding software development tools and methods. All work to be performed by the contractor will be defined in greater detail in particular "task descriptions" to be issued to the contractor by EPA.   The goal of each individual task is to produce the deliverables it requires within the schedule contained in its task description or task plan.  Skills and Expertise: The Contractor shall provide technical expertise for the development of computer modeling software. The Contractor shall provide expertise in object-oriented system analysis and design, object-oriented software development and testing, and in producing clear documentation.  The Contractor shall provide staff familiar with the goals and preliminary MOVES design, appropriate functional skills including: management of complicated, multi-part tasks; scientific system software design; programming in Java, SQL-based Data Base Management Software, C++, and software documentation.  The Contractor shall identify key personnel to perform the technical work described in this SOW.  These personnel will be committed to the project for its duration and shall not be substituted or replaced without written agreement of the Client Representative.  Deliverables:  The Contractor shall provide software development support services for the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.  Work shall be performed off-site. Generally, EPA shall request work products by means of formal task descriptions, which shall delineate specific objectives, deliverables, and constraints including priority indicators and completion dates.  Actual task descriptions will be issued following contract award.  The specific format and structure may vary by task at EPA discretion.  Within two working days of receipt of a task description the Contractor shall inform the Client Representative and Technical Contact that the Contractor accepts the task description as written, or shall provide the Client Representative and Technical Contact with a written request for changes in the task description or delivery date.  EPA shall consider such Contractor requests and revise the work order as EPA judges necessary.  Whether or not the work order is revised, the Contractor shall be responsible for delivering all end items specified in accepted task description by the task completion date.  All deliverables must be of professional quality and must meet the requirements set forth in this SOW and in the specific task description.  The contractor shall work within the "software development infrastructure" described above and shall comply with its requirements.    The Contractor shall provide all source code and data tables used to develop specific applications.  All products developed under this task order are the property of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition to the deliverables required by individual task descriptions, this statement of work requires the following deliverables: During the execution of task assignments the Contractor shall conduct a meeting in person every week, or more often if necessary, with the EPA Technical Contacts.  The Contractor shall provide EPA with a weekly oral report on Contractor activity and progress, including any issues to be resolved and any actual or forecast variances against work order commitments, and options for resolution of these variances. The contractor shall begin each task with the latest possible version of the MOVES software and provide EPA with updated copies of the source code on at least a weekly basis, identifying the version of the model, which was the basis for the changes, and the modules (including automated tests) added, changed and deleted relative to that version.  As defined by particular tasks deliverables will typically include tests designed to insure that the code functions as required. Special Instructions: GSA through its Client Agency Client Representative shall perform Management of this project.  A Client Representative shall be established for all government and Contractor meetings, technical guidance and product deliverables.  The Client Representative shall identify EPA Technical Contacts capable of providing the Contractor with technical assistance and clarification required for the performance of specific tasks.  The Contractor shall initiate work on this project by meeting with key Client Agency Representatives to insure a common understanding of the requirement, expectations, and ultimate end products.  The Contractor shall discuss the overall understanding of the project and review the background information and materials provided by the client.  Discussions shall also include the scope of work, deliverables to be produced, how the efforts shall be organized and the project conducted, assumptions made, and expected end results.  A concerted effort shall be made to gain a thorough understanding of the Client Agency expectations.  However, nothing discussed in this or in any subsequent meetings or discussions between the client and the Contractor shall be construed as adding, deleting, or modifying any Task Order requirements, including deliverable specifications and due dates.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to add an additional option period to contract 500-02-0001 with Arkansas BlueCross and BlueShield (ABCBS) on a Sole Source basis.  This contract provides software maintenance services to suport the Arkansas Part A Standard System (APASS). It was awarded on a sole source basis to ABCBS as they developed the APASS and have been solely responsible for its maintenance and enhancement.  This contract was awarded with a base and one year option period during which time fiscal intermediaries (FI) utilizing the APASS would transition to the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS).  Delays in the transition schedule have resulted in a need to extend the current contract to allow for completion of FI transitions.  Contracting for an additional option period of software maintenance services is an interim strategy not expected to exceed December 31, 2004.  It is being done to ensure maximum effective use of the existing APASS until the remaining transitions are complete and fully implemented.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposal.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audits (OA) conducted an expert evaluation of the Office of Audits.  A report was generated as a result of this evaluation.  Within the report, a blueprint was developed to implement a restructuring plan to decentralize the OIG Office of Audits in such a way that it functions optimally and in accordance with the statutory requirements of the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App.3.  Four areas were identified where change need to occur.  The first area concerned the restructuring of the Office of Audits by placing duties, responsibilities and accountability with Regional offices and empowering these offices to perform their assigned duties.  The second identified activities to be eliminated and/or modified, as well as, management systems that should be implemented or improved, to effectively manage the new organizational structure and to introduce new audit services.  The third identified actions that could be implemented to improve audit report clarity.  The last area identified cultural issues that needed to be addressed through training, and management initiatives.  It is the intent of the government to award a purchase order using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  This procurement is issued subject to FAR Parts 13 and 15 for a contractor to provide the implementation of the above organizational changes.  Copies of the report shall be provided upon request.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  NAICS Code for this requirement is 541618.  Period of performance shall be from date of award through December 31, 2002.  Anticipated solicitation date is on or around April 17, 2002.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for servicing an Infrared Spectrometer manufactured by Bomem, Inc.  The period of performance will include a one-year basic period and four, one-year options. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  Bomem, Inc. who is the only responsible source and no other services will satsify the agency requirements.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 30, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems Product Group, Infantry Weapons Program Manager is soliciting proposals which address technologies and systems that are capable of incapacitating personnel. Incapacitation is defined as the effect of  ?depriving individuals or groups the ability to perform their desired/intended tasks or functions for a period of time?. An incapacitated individual or group does not have the physical and/or mental ability to perform their desired act. Examples of potential intended tasks are: pull a trigger, push a button, release a button, acquire a target, flee, communicate, or gather information through the senses. The technology or system can be effective at preventing one or more of a target?s intended tasks.
	The desired capability should be effective and suitable for one or more of the following priority ordered mission tasks, in an operational scenario: Provide Force protection against an area threat, Clearing a space by entering the space, Provide Force Protection against a point threat, Control the actions of a group, Control the actions of an individual, Deny an area in a facility, Deny an area in the open, Clear a space without entering the space, and Disperse a group of people.
	The prioritized measures of performance (MoPs) are listed below. Proposed capabilities should meet most of the MOP threshold requirements (thresholds given). The MoP values given are for all mission tasks listed above, therefore; a range of values may be indicated.
1. Adverse conditions - 95% - Percent times system functions in all weather operational environments (only 5% of system lifetime malfunctions are due to weather/environmental conditions).  2. Onset time for effect- 1 second - Time for incapacitation effect to take affect measured from payload release.    3. WF risk from hostiles - less than 1.75 seconds - The amount of time user is exposed (to hostile fire) into to ?fire? system.  4. Deliverability - 5-20% - The amount of ?spill over? or coverage of ?effect zone? outside of intended target area. 5. Ability to counter - 95-98% - Percent of times used, system not counted. (i.e probability of being countered 2-5%. 6. Consistent effect - 3-10% - Variance of effect across global population (race, sex, age, etc.). The desired effect is 90-97% consistent against all peoples.  7. Duration of Effect ? 30 seconds ? 2hours - Amount of time effect lasts measured after onset time has lapsed.  8.Employment Availability - 5-25 times - Number of times useable over 24 hours without downtime.  9. Tolerance buildup - 3-10 times - Number of times used (same individual or group) until no longer effective due to target familiarization (physically, physiologically or mentally)with effect.  10. WF risk from effect - 	98% - Percent of user force not affected by effect of system use (fratricide). Over lifetime, effect from device can affect only 2% of friendly force to some degree (of effect). 11. Operational Availability - 90% - Percent of time system available for operational and training use.   12. Self evacuate - 90% - Percent of time any given target will be able to self-evacuate after effect subsides.  13. Manpower Requirements ? System must be able to be operated and maintained through cross-training of personnel only. New MOS and/or dedicated personnel are not acceptable. 14. Portability - 95% - Percent of missions operator remained effective while carrying system. Must be portable.   15. Non-Lethality - 95% - Percent of times death did not occur in targets  16. Preparation to employ - 4 seconds - Time to prepare system to engage target in operational scenario (consistent with lethal weapon prep time).   17.Compatibility - 95% - Percent of DoD systems with which proposed system is compatible   18.Training complexity - 5 days - Total training days per year required  19. Aftercare - 10 sec - Amount of time required for aftercare per individual target such that target can self-evacuate.
19.  Injury toPersonnel - 75-90% - Percent of time personnel not injured from system effect. Injury means broken bones, severe lacerations (requires stitches), or greater. 20.Setup, maintenance & supply - 	30 hours - Total yearly maintenance time including personal maintenance   21. Impact of residue - 10 minutes - Amount of time required for removal of any residue per system use.  22. Property Damage - 	90-95% - Percent of times property not damaged from system use.
It is desirable (not essential) for the proposed capability to be man-portable. It is desirable that the system be non-lethal ?from the muzzle? to the maximum effective engagement range. 
Instructions for Preparation of Initial Proposal and Proposals

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has a requirement for systems engineering support, quality assurance, research and development support, manufacturing processes, financial and management support services for support of the F/A-18 Hornet Aircraft.

This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with Raytheon Technical Services Company, Engineering and Production Support (RTSC EPS), 6125 E21st Street, Indianapolis, IN 46219-2058, on an other than full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with RTSC EPS to provide continuity in the required ongoing engineering services.  RTSC EPS has provided Engineering and Technical Support since the initial development stages of the F/A-18 Hornet Aircraft.  RTSC EPS possesses all the technical expertise, experience, facilities, and associated proprietary data necessary to provide F-18 Nonstandard Parts Review and Parts Management Program support due to the unique circumstances associated with the privatization of NAWCADI.  RTSC EPS is a production house that also provides technical support. RTSC EPS has knowledge of and experience with Design for Manufacturing and Lean Manufacturing, which is critical to the continued support of the F/A-18 program.   The development of this capability with any other activity would require significant costs to assimilate the required learning for these tasks and would result in schedule delays for the F/A-18 Hornet program.  

The proposed action will be Fixed Price contract and the estimated period of performance for the contract will be 12 months, with four 12-month options.  Government site workspace will not be available; all work will be accomplished at the contractor site.  


This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document is available.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice.  Responses shall be considered by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts Department.  Responses without a return address, mailing address, and company telephone number will not be recognized.  Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR web site at http:///ccr.edi.disa.mil/.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses to this synopsis should be sent via email to JohnsonDM3@navair.navy.mil before 29th of April 2002.

The core system must be compatible with the existing image scanning subsystem and softcopy stereo core capability.  The scanner must be consistent with existing Digital Cartographic Production Systems and NT systems in the National Mapping Division and scan data compliant to make USGS standard data. This new system will be fully integrated with the existing core capability and replace one of two PS-1 scanners already in use.  The newer system is expected to increase output by three times and have a higher capacity for storage and in-house maintenance.  The PhotoScan system utilizes similar operational software already existing in the PS-1 scanner currently in use.  Due to the uniqueness of the existing core capability and the proprietary Z/I data formats existing with both the core capability and PhotoScan, it has been determined that any other vendor may incur developmental tasks that would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This requirement is subject to the availability of funds.  This not a request for quotation and a quotation will not be issued.  Responsible sources who wish to respond to this synopsis may submit their statement of capabilities by close of business on April 22, 2002 to Sonya A. Baird, Contracting Officer, U. S.

<SUBJECT>A--Design of a High-speed Drag Reduction Experiment
<SOLNBR>02-014
<RESPDATE>060302
<CONTACT>Patrick Purtell, Program Officer, Phone 703-696-4308, Email baadrx@onr.navy.mil - Cheryl DeLisle, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2571, Email delislc@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>Modern militaries are conducting operations at speeds high enough that successful inter-vention by the United States (US) will require the transport of men and materiel from the US to distant trouble spots at speeds greater than ever before.  Increases of the required magnitudes cannot be had by simply going to bigger propulsion plants because the rate of fuel consumption would bar achieving long range.  Instead, a viable solution requires finding and imple-menting some means of greatly reducing turbulent friction drag.  It is not known whether such drag reduction is possible, and so the work described here will lay the groundwork for obtaining the needed fundamental knowledge.

Objective and Areas of Interest: The Office of Naval Research is interested in receiving proposals for the design of a hydrodynamic experiment capable of a definitive resolution of the ques-tions relating to full-scale implementation of friction drag reduction procedures at very high ship speeds. The objective is guidance for ship designers; more fundamental in-quiries will be entertained only to the extent that the information is shown to be needed for that design guidance. High speed and large test-model size are two parameters of major interest, with the former being accorded the much greater emphasis.

Technical Guidance: A detailed description of technical requirements is contained in a docu-ment entitled ?Statement of Work: Design of A High-Speed Drag Reduction Experiment,? which is available to interested parties by submitting an e-mail request to the Sub-mission Coor-dinator identified above.

Contractual Structure: It is anticipated that any award(s) will be in the form of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract(s), each contract having two phases plus an option for a third. The first phase, of four months duration, will produce a preliminary design sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for a government decision whether to proceed with the second phase, which will also be of four months duration. The second phase will produce (a) a final design sufficiently detailed to permit the start of fabrication of the drag reduction experiment, (b) a set of performance estimates, (c) an exploitation plan, and (d) a refinement of the cost and schedule to complete in the third phase. (The Statement of Work cited under ?Tech-nical Guidance? above contains further information.) The second phase final report will be or-ganized as a proposal to enter into the third phase, fabri-cation, entry into which will be an op-tion open to the government.

Available Funding: As much as $3M is available to cover Phase 1 plus Phase 2, and multiple awards may be made if the total fits inside that cap.

General Requirements for Proposals:  Proposals should be submitted to the following ad-dress: Office of Naval Research, Ballston Tower One, Attn: Patrick Purtell, Rm.507, 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5660. The information submitted in the proposals must be unclassified. Proposal submissions must be in hard copy, with one (1) original and nine (9) photocopies. Proposals submitted electronically or by fax will not be considered eligible. Font should be 12-point, Times New Roman. The page limi-tations set forth below are based on 8.5" x 11" paper with 1" margins and single-spac-ing. Each offeror should submit a cover sheet with its proposal. This cover sheet, which will not be counted against any page restric-tions referenced in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), should include the name, ad-dress, telephone number, fax number, and E-mail address for the technical and business points of contact on the project. The work statement cited above under ?Technical Guidance? is a governing requirement.

Specific Requirements for Proposals: The due date for receipt of proposals is 4 p.m. (EDT) on 3 June 2002. Proposals shall consist of two separate sections, one for Technical and another for Cost. Both sections shall reference the BAA number and in-clude the offeror's pro-ject title.

The technical section of the proposal should follow the following format: 1) List of Pro-ject Manager(s) and a Description of Programmatic Structure (including Subcontractors if any); 2) Technical Objective and Expected Payoff, Quantified to the Extent Possible; 3) Proposed Technical Approach; 4) Schedule/ Milestones/Deliverables; 5) Relationship to Other Projects in Which the Offeror Participates; 6) Summary of Qualifications/Experience of Key Personnel (including formal resumes); and 7) State-ment of Work (which should be provided as an at-tachment to the proposal and should otherwise be provided as a separate section that does not include proprietary informa-tion to allow for incorporation into a contract award). The technical portion of the pro-posal, excluding the resumes, should not exceed 25 pages in length. 

The cost section of the proposal has no page limitation. The cost section should include the following: a detailed Cost Proposal for the first and second phases, an estimated cost of the third phase, a completed Certification Package, and a Small Business Subcontracting Plan (if applicable). The detailed cost proposal should fully segregate costs by cost category and should in-clude the following cost items, if appropriate: direct labor, fringe benefits, indirect labor, materials, subcontracts, consultants, travel, other direct costs, G&A, cost of money, and fixed fee. Direct labor should show each individual labor category or per-son, with asso-ciated hours and specific unburdened direct labor rate. All indirect costs (includ-ing fringe, indirect labor, G&A, and COM) should show base amount and rate. Details and ex-planation of all other costs items should be given in this section. 

The cost section should be accompanied by a completed certification package. The package can be accessed on the ONR Home Page at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/repcert.htm. Proposals for CPFF contracts should use the certification package entitled "Representations and Certifica-tions for Contracts." 

The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement. The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful sub-contracting opportunities for small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small dis-advantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and uni-versities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must ac-company con-tract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small busi-nesses. Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract pro-posals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institu-tions (MI) are en-couraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting propos-als. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of re-serving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technol-ogy for exclusive competition among these entities.

Final selections should be made by the middle of June 2002. Proposals received after the published due dates may not be considered. Proposers will be notified via e-mail of selection or non-selection for an award. Proposals exceeding the page limit may not be reviewed.

Proposal Evaluation: The evaluation of proposals will be performed by a Review Team of government technical experts drawn from the Office of Naval Research, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), the naval systems commands, navy warfare centers, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and other naval and defense activi-ties/agencies. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals arising from this solicitation. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection in-formation. The evaluations of propos-als will be conducted using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of im-portance: 1) Strength of the concepts and approach for a hydrodynamics drag reduction experiment; 2) Strength of the approach to the structural, mechanical, and civil engineering hydrodynamics aspects; 3) Strength of the approach to safety considerations; 4) Strength of the design of the experiment; 5) Quality/relevance of offeror's capabilities, re-lated experience, programmatic structure, facilities, techniques, or unique com-binations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and reducing programmatic risk; 6) Quality/relevance of qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator or team leader and other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and 7) Realism of the proposed cost and extent to which the cost effectiveness of the proposed research is diminished by expen-ditures for excessive admin-istrative and overhead expenses.

Notice to Government Entities: Government entities and Federally Funded Research and De-velopment Centers (FFRDCs) are not eligible to submit proposals under this BAA.

Other BAA Information: This CBD notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Offerors should state in their proposals that it is submitted in response to BAA 02-014. Except as stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government will not pay for proposal prepa-ration costs. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not allowable as a di-rect charge to any contract resulting from this BAA or to any other Government contract. Questions of a business nature shall be directed to the Contract Specialist, Cheryl De Lisle Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the Technical Point of Contact, Dr. Patrick Purtell. See contact information shown above. Offerors are advised that only Contracting Offi-cers are legally authorized to con-tractually bind or otherwise commit the Government. 

RESTRICTION ON DISCLOSURE AND USE OF DATA: Offerors will apply the restric-tive notice prescription of FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisi-tion, to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: 
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicle Components Branch (VSSV), as part of the Space Vehicle Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in lightweight mirror technology for space-deployable imaging telescopes.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $800K over 8 to 15 months. AFRL will make one award. This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) will remain open 30 days after date of publication.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC) is encouraged until proposals are received. AFRL Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation. 
The Government will provide a site visit on 10 April 2002.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC, Dr. R. Scott Erwin, (505) 846-9816, to make arrangements to participate in the site visit.
B. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA: 
This technical effort is focused on the development of lightweight mirror systems technology for space-deployable imaging telescope applications. The contractor should consider innovative approaches for the design of stiff, lightweight, space-traceable mirrors that meet the performance requirements of visible imaging applications.   Development of prototype mirrors based on the proposed technology is desired.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that addresses the following goals (in order of importance):  ultra-lightweight, high-stiffness mirror structures (technology goals of < 15 kg/m2 areal density, which must factor in any required mechanisms and control electronics, and first natural frequency in test mounting configuration > 80 Hz), applicability to large apertures (technology goal of 0.6 meters diameter circular), ability to achieve desired radius of curvature in mirror structures (technology goal of 5 meters ?b .2% for spherical optics), ability to achieve stringent radius-of-curvature matching between segments (technology goal of < 40 microns differential ROC between 3 segments), ability to provide stringent mirror surface figure error (technology goal relative to a best fit reference sphere ?T ??/4 peak to valley and < ??/40 rms at 633 nm over central 95% clear aperture), visible-quality, space-qualifiable coatings (technology goal is reflectivity of R ?d 90% from 450 - 850 nm at normal incidence, with no visible pinholes or defects in surfaces when viewed without magnification over central 95% clear aperture, with durability performance equivalent or greater to that of standard aluminum coatings),  low surface roughness (technology goal ?T 20 angstroms rms over central 95% clear aperture), stringent mirror surface quality (technology goal better than 40-20 scratch ?V dig over central 95% clear aperture), low complexity approaches (i.e. non-actuated), low thermal gradient sensitivity mirror structures (i.e. low thermal expansion or high conductivity), and approaches that offer significant improvements in manufacturing time to current commercial mirror fabrication techniques.
Offerors must propose development, design, fabrication, and test three (3) prototype mirrors that address all of the above technology goals to be acceptable for award.  These mirrors must be compatible with a 3 point mechanical mounting interface, to be provided by AFRL, that will allow further test and evaluation by the Government.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC Dr. R. Scott Erwin, AFRL/VSSV, 505-846-9816, fax 505-846-7877, email: richard.erwin@kirtland.af.mil to obtain a description of the mounting interface and planned AFRL testing configuration.  
All measurement units presented to the Air Force should use the meter-kilogram-second (MKS) system.

<DESC>NA This amendment is in response to industry inquires.  We are amending the solicitation to show that the intent of the information provided in the synopsis on the “500 Horsepower class” covers a range, i.e. the 300-800 horsepower.  The purpose of the solicit ation is to increase the state-of-the-art in component technology for an affordable high-performance small engine.  The purpose is to give the offerors engine performance information for a 500 horsepower engine to guide them as to how much we are looking t o push technology in these component programs.  This performance will change when scaling engine size within this class.  We are in the early stages of the Army’s defining future UAV platforms and missions.  The only thing we know is that we will need to w ork small engine technology.  The $120k per engine production cost (including basic HMU or FADEC control system) is defined as the average production cost of the estimated 1000 engines.  The estimated engine SFC and SHP/Wt requirements do not require inclu sion of an engine IPS system with its performance and weight penalty. The solicitation closing date remains unchanged as a result of this amendment. Contact Ms. Katherine Kearney, Contract Specialist, kkearney@aatd.eustis.army.mil.if there are additional q uestions.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The 99th Contracting Squadron/LGCB is conducting market research to seek qualified sources with the capability of providing support of all training and testing operations which utilize the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS).  These operations include various flying exercises and competitions, and other special training/testing missions as may be required.  Contractor shall collect, enter, retrieve, and analyze data as required.  The contractor shall support aircrew package debriefs (normally two or three) and a mass aircrew debrief for each mission.  There are normally two large packages per exercise day.  These air operations are conducted at the rate of 700 to 5000 sorties for a six week period, depending on the exercise. An Air Tasking Order (ATO) is generated for each exercise day.  The ATO outlines the actions and objectives for each participant, integrates all participants, and results in the generation of several aircrew debriefing products which include graphic flight path tracks for each aircraft; air&#64979;to&#64979;air, air&#64979;to&#64979;ground, and ground&#64979;to&#64979;air events; electronic countermeasures maintenance; survivability; aggressor tactics; and other related data.  This data is transmitted live, or recorded, from exercise aircraft and received and processed by government computer systems for use at mission debriefings.  Recorded data will require post mission merging.  This debrief data is also maintained in an on&#64979;line data base to allow for the analysis of aggregate historical data concerning the capabilities and strategies applied in tactical air operations.  Basic support shall be for up to five exercises per year.  Exercises vary from two to six weeks in duration. Separate morning, afternoon and nighttime operations may be conducted.  The majority of work shall be accomplished at Nellis AFB NV but will also be required at Eglin AFB for the Technical Analyst, and at a Canadian Base for one exercise. While normal duty hours are 0730 to 1630 hours, Monday through Friday, staggered shifts and minimal weekend support may be required to support unique mission requirements and provide timely documentation products. The contractor shall provide up to 16 hours of continuous mission support in accordance with daily flying schedules defined by the government. Delayed shifts may also be necessary to support night missions. The contractor shall use staggered shifts and flex&#64979;time to support specific exercise or special missions outside of normal operating times to avoid using overtime. When required to meet increased mission requirements, the government reserves the right to augment contractor key entry technicians with military and/or civilian personnel. The contract support responsibilities are generally divided into two categories: basic data processing/analysis requirements, and surge requirements to be implemented as required for mission accomplishment. The contractor shall review and update lesson plans and visual aids, support preparation of professional quality products, ensure that exercise data is transmitted and stored for production of aircrew debriefing products and historical use, interview excercise participants for customer satisfaction and publish results for debriefings, accomplish daily system user file backups, provide an automated means to collect security data, and maintain the Red Flag Technical Library and provide reference services.  Most personnel categories require a bachelor degree and/or experience in the specific discipline (i.e. Contract Manager/Senior Analyst, Senior Programmer/Analyst, Technical Senior Analyst (TSA), etc).  The contractor is required to have a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmental Information clearance and must have or be eligible to receive Special Access Program status at the performance start date (tentatively set for 1 Oct 2002).  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  The government will not pay for any information that is submitted in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT request.  Any information submitted is voluntary.  Request interested firms submit a Statement of Capabilites (SOC) to this office to include, but not be limited to:  (1) a summary of similar, recent (within the past three fiscal years) performance history (include points of contact and applicable telephone numbers, fax numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses, if available, as well as identification in what capacity that work was performed (e.g., prime contractor, consultant, subcontractor, etc.); (2) the firm?s capability of obtaining the required security clearance; and (3) their business size status (e.g., large, small, hubzone, 8(a), disadvantaged, woman-owned, etc.).  The applicable NAICS Code for this effort is 541990; a firm would be considered small if their average annual receipts for the preceding three fiscal years was equal to or less than $6M.  Responses must be received no later than 4:30 PM Pacific Daylight Time, on 22 April 2002.  Response to this notice will assist the Government in determining potential sources and is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  If a soliciation is issued, it will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities web-site, http://www.eps.gov. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to develop an electronic interface that transmits data between itself and its partners in the Disability processing program.  Under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USC 402 and 416), SSA mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits.  In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities.  SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. There are approximately 117 DDS sites nationally.  DDS sites are diverse in size, ranging from staff of 2 to 875, although most fall in the 35 to 350 range. 
 Many of the states use licensed proprietary software developed by I. Levy and Associates, Inc.  They have contracts specific to each state and they have state maintenance agreements with I. Levy and Associates, Inc. to support the code.  In addition, each state has, by necessity and choice, customized the code to meet their specific requirements.  The current lines of code vary from state to state, depending on the degree of customization and the interface to the state systems, but a representative estimate is approximately 1,000,000 lines of code per state.
Over the last few years, SSA and the DDSs have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs.  These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs.  SSA has updated its strategy for automating enhancements to the Disability program.  The revised strategy, the Electronic Disability system (eDib), is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder.   The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases.  The first step towards implementing the Electronic Folder will involve creating a generic interface between SSA and the DDSs.  SSA will identify and describe the interface standards and the initial set of data elements.   SSA is seeking a contractor who can develop and test the generic interface and the necessary modifications to the DDS software systems.  The contractor will be required to work with the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. User Group to identify data elements that should be propagated into their legacy system.  The legacy system software will then be modified to utilize these agreed upon elements.  These modifications should be designed so that, in the future, the interface and its supporting processes can be implemented in additional I. Levy and Associates, Inc states.  This interface must preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the specific user interfaces and user screen presentations which exist in the current DDS systems, so as to minimize potential work flow impact and the need for user retraining.  SSA will not provide the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. proprietary source code.  Vendors having the capability and experience to provide such a service are invited to submit complete details.  The details must include the following:
- Demonstrated success in writing and supporting COBOL applications on the IBM AS/400 platform;  
- A detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used in dealing with the I. Levy and Associates, Inc. proprietary source code and data structures. Responses must clearly state the ability to provide the service required.  Interested parties must respond to this notice in writing within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication.  Please refer to LJH-02-002.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.   REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE HONORED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

2. Clarification for page 45, paragraph HF035:

Payroll burden is to be included in the contractor?s coefficient.

3.  Clarification:

4. Secure conference facility.  The contractor shall make arrangements to secure the appropriate rooms for workshops and one plenary session.  Associated costs will be paid by the contractor.  
5. Coordinate facility arrangements, including a continental breakfast, audio/visual equipment, and any other related items.  The contractor shall make arrangements for a continental breakfast (for the plenary session) as well as amplification systems as appropriate.  Limited audio/visual equipment may be deemed necessary.  These costs are to be paid by the contractor.

6. Administer conference registration.  Develop registration information so that HUD may utilize contact information at a later date.
  
7. Coordinate and provide on-site assistance and arrange for special conference needs.  



The Department has identified only one responsible source for this requirement, and this procurement will therefore be conducted on a sole-source basis.  The intended contractor for this action is Wray and Associates.  

Wray and Associates is the conference coordinator for the Prayer Breakfast, and therefore is already aware of the list of invitees and participants.  Wray and Associates is therefore in a unique position to be able to disseminate the necessary information efficiently.  In addition, this conference is the first of its kind, and therefore no other source would have the information already available to Wray and Associates.  

However, any responsible vendor may submit an offer for this requirement.  If interested, please contact Mr. Richard Melrose, Contract Specialist, at (202) 708-1772, ext. 7136, or at Richard_Melrose@hud.gov.  Please note that you must contact Mr. Melrose prior to Monday, April 22, 2002.

<SUBJECT>--INVITATION TO COMMERCIAL VENDORS TO EXHIBIT DURING 11th ANNUAL INTEGRATED TRAINING AREA MANAGEMENT (ITAM) WORKSHOP 19-23 AUGUST 2002
<DESC>NA Sponsors of the 11th Annual Integrated Training Area Management  (ITAM) Workshop are seeking commercial vendors to exhibit their products and/or services for three days during the Workshop.  This year, the ITAM Workshop is to be held at the Savannah Marrio tt Riverfront Hotel in Savannah, Georgia, on 19-23 August 2002. The ITAM Workshop is the leading national forum for the scientific exchange of technologies, ideas, experiences, and lessons learned that relate to the application of Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) technologies to the Army’s military training l ands.  The ITAM Programs at all U.S. Army installations must play a critical role in assuring that military training can be sustained at the highest level for the foreseeable future.  Training activities have increased, and training budgets are expanding. Businesses, organizations, companies, and individuals with products and services that relate to land management, land repair and reclamation, wind and soil erosion management, air and water quality issues, forestry and crop land management, GIS program dev elopment and support, road and trail creation and maintenance, environmental and climatological monitoring, unexploded ordnance, and other similar topics will find a ready audience among the ITAM Workshop participants. There will be approximately 500 decision-makers representing government and industry attending the annual ITAM Workshop.  It provides a unique opportunity to present and explain commercial products and services that can contribute to sustaining military tr aining and training land rehabilitation and maintenance to the ITAM Coordinators and their staffs.  This is the only all-Army event that brings together the ITAM teams from the U.S. Army’s installations worldwide. Compared to the costs of visiting individual military installations, the ITAM Workshop offers a most cost-effective sales strategy for companies and firms to hold significant face-to-face conversations with ITAM Coordinators and their staffs. The ITAM Workshop will focus on operations and environmental programs for sustaining military training lands and maintaining Army readiness.  In addition to the main program of technical presentations at the Workshop, there will be several specialized sess ions, including a one-day Geographic Information System (GIS) workshop, a Range Training Lands Program (RTLP) session, a Land Condition Trends Analysis (LCTA) workshop, and individual Major Army Command (MACOM) meetings.    The 11th Annual ITAM Workshop is being hosted by Fort Stewart, Georgia, the ITAM Installation Steering Committee, and the Army Training and Support Center.    The commercial exhibits will be located in the Atrium area of the Savannah Marriott Riverfront Hotel, which is at -the crossroads of the Workshop-.  The Morning Breaks, the AM Breaks, and the PM Breaks all will be held in the exhibit area in the Atrium. No program activities or breakout sessions will be scheduled for 30 minutes after each AM or PM Break begins on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Tuesday evening, a two-hour No-host Social for all participants will be held amid the exhibits in the Atrium area.  Exhi bitors are cordially invited to participate in all open sessions and social events associated with the ITAM Workshop. Due to current security concerns, the opportunity for vendors to present live demonstrations at Fort Stewart on Thursday, 22 August, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.   All vendor exhibit arrangements will be made through the National Institute for Land Management and Training (NILMT) at Kansas State University, the conference support contractor.  To obtain an application to exhibit during the 11th Annual ITAM Workshop or  to secure further information, commercial vendors may contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2100.  Dr. Biles’ e-mail address is:  brbiles@ksu.edu.   Individuals interested in attending the 11th Annual ITAM Workshop may f ind additional information and/or register online at: http://www.army-itam.com or by calling the Kansas State University Division of Continuing Learning Registration Desk at 785.532.5569.
