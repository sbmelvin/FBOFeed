<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-12
SUSTAINED LITTORAL PRESENCE (SLP)

BAA CLOSING DATE: One year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov; FULL PROPOSALS FOR INITIAL SELECTIONS DUE: 1200 noon EST on 16 January 2006.  POC: Dr. Edward Carapezza, DARPA/ATO, 3701 Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714; Email: BAA06-12@darpa.mil; Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/SLP/index.htm.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and demonstration to support the Sustained Littoral Presence Program. The SLP program objectives are: (1) to develop sustainable, microbial fuel cells (bottom mounted and in the water column) to generate continuous, unattended power for greater than 10 years in both ocean and fresh water regions and (2) to develop unique mobile surveillance systems that utilize these novel microbial power plants and operate with a high degree of autonomy, stealth, and weather tolerance with minimum cost and manpower risk. These SLP objectives will be achieved through the development of enabling technologies and the integration of said technologies into systems via a phased, multiyear program.

Pursuant to the program objectives, this BAA solicits both system and technology proposals that include (but are not limited to) the following technology areas: instruments to identify and determine concentrations of microbial species in real time and in situ in marine sediments and adjacent waters;
instruments to identify and determine concentrations of chemical reactants and reductants in real time and in situ in marine sediments and adjacent waters; instruments to characterize environmental processes and related parameters in real time and in situ in marine sediments and adjacent waters (temperature, salinity, pressure); models and simulations to represent the parameter space and processes required to produce reliable power from microbial fuel cells in laboratories and in situ in coastal waters; fuel cell components (electrode materials, surfaces, and coatings); fuel cell power monitoring, conditioning, processing, and storage; location and characterization of plankton type and concentration in water column; plankton filtering in water; extraction  of oxygen and methane gases from ocean and fresh water; microbial conversion of methane gas to liquid methanol, in situ in marine environments; microbial conversion of methane gas to hydrogen, in situ in marine environments; bottom mounted microbial fuel cell systems; water column microbial fuel cell systems; amphibious vehicles with integral microbial fuel cell systems; and water column vehicles with integral microbial fuel cell systems.
 
This BAA affords offerors the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Procurement Contract, Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Technology Investment Agreement, or Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.

Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following criteria, in descending order of importance: 1) Technical approach, 2) Management approach, 3) Potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission, 4) Relevant experience in developing military systems, and 5) Cost reasonableness and realism.  Since no common work statement exists, each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates to the program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

This BAA shall remain open through one year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov.  Although the Government may receive responses at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  In order to be considered for initial selections, full proposals must be received by the Government no later than 1200 noon on 16 January 2006.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Also the Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 105-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

For additional information on the SLP program, reference the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP). NOTE: DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ALL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SENT TO BAA06-12@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source contract to Williams Fairey Engineering Limited (WFEL), P. O. Box 41 Crossley Road Heaton Chapel, Stockport Cheshire SK4 5BD England.  This sole source award will be made to design, fabricate, deliver, and provide analysis and set-up documentation for a Ski Jump Ramp in support of flight test operations of the F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft, which weighs approximately 62,000 lbs.  A Ski Jump is used to assist STOVL aircraft during shipboard takeoffs.  This land based Ski Jump will be used to exercise the F-35B STOVL JSF prior to conducting shipboard testing. The contract requires expertise in the design of structures to withstand the complex dynamic loads imparted by a STOVL aircraft during Ski-Jump Takeoffs and in the design and production of structures that limit the risk of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to an aircraft.  The requirement involves design, production, and delivery of equipment, analysis, and documentation products to provide a Ski Jump Test Capability. A sole source acquisition is required under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) due to WFEL’s unique experience in Ski Jump structures, specialized production expertise, and critical appreciation of aircraft-compatible design requirements.  The anticipated period of performance is one base year with one option year.  The base year of the contract will be for the design of the ramp.  The option year of the contract will include fabrication, testing, and delivery of the ramp, consultation during the initial ramp set up, as well as analysis and documentation.  All interested parties may identify their capability and respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No phone inquiries will be entertained.  Responses shall be made in writing by email, U.S. mail, or facsimile to the attention of Jason Lawson using the contact information provided in this synopsis.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Pittsburgh?s Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory to build a prototype RODS system that incorporates and analyzes water quality data and clinical data. On January 30, 2004, the President of the United States issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9), which directed EPA to develop robust, comprehensive, and fully coordinated monitoring and surveillance systems for drinking water.  To address these responsibilities, EPA is developing an early warning system, known as WaterSentinel, which includes integration of water quality parameters and consumer complaints into existing public health syndromic surveillance systems as a key component. Currently, there are two nationally available syndromic surveillance systems in use by local and state health departments across the country:  RODS and ESSENCE.  Since WaterSentinel may be deployed in cities using RODS, EPA is requesting that the University of Pittsburgh modify the RODS program language and analytical algorithms to integrate water quality parameters and consumer complaints collected by the water utility.  Once this project is completed, any city desiring to utilize the water-based program enhancements will be able to do so.  While some aspects of the RODS program code are open-source, core components are proprietary to the University of Pittsburgh.  Consequently, demonstrating the ability to incorporate water utility data into RODS (the public health syndromic surveillance system already in place in proposed WS cities) can only be performed by the RODS Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh.   This project will task the University of Pittsburgh, to modify the non-open source program code necessary to support the nationwide deployment of real-time water quality data into cities? existing public health syndromic surveillance systems. The concept described herein will be demonstrated in two cities that currently utilize RODS as their public health syndromic surveillance system, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.  A complementary study is also being pursued with ESSENCE via a sole source contract with Johns Hopkins University, the controller of the program code for ESSENCE.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond.  Documentation must be received by December 14, 2005 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Air Education and Training Command Contracting Squadron (AETC CONS) at Randolph AFB, TX, intends to award multiple contracts to provide worldwide construction and engineering activities supporting the Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (S/R&M) of real property.  Projects will be located at various locations worldwide.  This contract is referred to as Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization Acquisition Task Order Contract (SATOC).

The SATOC Program is intended to serve as the primary contract vehicle for AFCESA’s newly formed S/R&M program and primarily supports existing Air Force facilities and infrastructure.  The program supports a range of S/R&M efforts with both small (<$100K) and large task orders (>$5M) expected.  The SATOC contractual program will meet AFCESA customer requirements worldwide, including locations in remote, austere, and hostile environments.  The contract will be available for use by all Federal agencies.
The capabilities under this contract are intended to provide planning and construction support for the Air Force, any DoD component, any US Federal Government agency operating in support of missions which could include but are not limited to National Command Authority, joint or combined United States military forces acting as part of or in concert with United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational force, or other organizations.  Support can include a wide spectrum of single or multi-theater tasking to meet requirements within and outside the Continental United States. 
The SATOC acquisition strategy contemplated is awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with pricing arrangements Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).  Requirements will be satisfied via turn-key, design build/design build plus, concept work plan/implantation work plan, traditional construction delivery types as well as incidental maintenance activities.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 236220 with an applicable size standard of $28,500,000.  Award will be made to the Offeror(s) proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described below.  Historically, firm fixed pricing arrangements have met the needs of our customer, however, periodically the requirement will not be as definitive, therefore the CPFF pricing arrangement is added to the contract line item structure.  Contract clauses for both pricing arrangements have been included in the solicitation as well as applicable construction clauses to include Davis Bacon requirements, Service Contract Act clauses for the incidental services included in the statement of work, Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) language, Security Classification (DD254) language and required indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity clauses. 





In accordance with FAR 19.10, this requirement will be competed as full and open competition.  The AETC CONS intends to award approximately 15 to 20 awards with a program ceiling of $10B over a ten-year period.  The request for proposal (RFP) will be unrestricted and provide for full and open competition.  Based on the requirements of this acquisition and the capability to perform world wide, the solicitation will stress teaming arrangements.  Based on historical acquisition information, a portion of the requirement is set-aside for 8(a),  Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and HUBZone small business awards.  We anticipate making 15-20 awards, with up to 5 of these awards as 8(a) set asides, up to one SDVOSB and up to one HUBZone small business (depending on proposals received). 



The proposed contract is expected to be a five (5) year basic plus five (5) one year options Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Task orders will be issued against the contract as required. The RFP release date is scheduled for 15 Dec 05 and will be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and the HQ AFCESA website at http://www.afcesa.af.mil/satoc.   The proposal due date is scheduled for 15 Feb 06, however, Past Performance Information (PPI) Forms are due NLT 15 days prior to the proposal due date or 30 January 06.  The Government anticipates making award(s) without discussions.  All inquiries or comments are to be provided in writing to AETC CONS/LGCK, Attention: Ron A. Mortag, 2021 First Street West, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4302, fax (210) 652-3445 or via e-mail (ron.mortag@Randolph.af.mil), phone 210-652-4856 or Martha Giannotti (martha.giannotti@Randolph.af.mil) phone (210) 652-2490.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces its intention to perform repairs and alterations to the historic James A. Walsh Courthouse in Tucson, Arizona.

The existing building, constructed in 1929, is comprised of four stories of steel and concrete with an interior light court, totaling approximately 73,521 gross square feet (6,830 GSM) (excluding parking).  The project includes the build-out of one new courtroom and Judge's chambers, renovations to the existing fourth floor video courtroom and the third floor historic courtroom, replacement of non-historic windows to meet security, energy and historic criteria;, construction of new first floor public intake area; installation of perimeter security bollards, planters and new sidewalk paving on the Scott and Broadway sides of the building, new masonry perimeter walls on the north and west sides of the courthouse; limited mechanical and electrical upgrades including new cooling tower, and repairs to the building envelope.

The Walsh Courthouse is occupied. So much of the work will be completed on off hours and weekends.  The estimated total construction cost of the project is in the range of $8 Million - $10 Million.

Construction Award is tentatively scheduled for February 28, 2006.
Construction Completion is tentatively set for January 2008.

Offerors are hereby requested to contact GSA Contracting Officer Lilia West via email and register their interest in becoming the General Contractor for the project by December 15, 2005.

Construction acquisition for this project will be by Source Selection process (FAR Part 15).  The technical factor is based on the contractor's quantity of past experience in renovation of historic buildings;  repairs of occupied buildings, alteration projects of similar dollar value (with a contract amount of a least five million dollars) and quality of past performance within the last ten (10) years.  Cost and technical factors are of equal weight.  As cost and technical factors become more equal, cost becomes more important.

Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority businesses are encourage to participate.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor (if large business) will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and diadvantaged contractors.  Before award of the contract, the Offeror (if not a small business having average gross receipts of less than $4 million during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Laws 95-507.

You can also view the plans and specifications at 300 West Congress, Tucson, Arizona, Room 2J.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.     Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.     The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.     The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.     The RFP will be issued on or about 11/29/05.     Proposals shall be received on or about 1/5/06.     Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.     Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.     The Government may make an award without discussions.     Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.     However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.     Two factors will be considered:     a technical evaluation factor and price.     The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.     The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.     As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.     The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.     All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.     The solicitation is now available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).     FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.     It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.     At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:     Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.     No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.     You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.     You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.     It is the vendor?s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.     
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions. 
 Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<CONTACT>Raymond J. Navarro Contracting Officer 4129372839     rnavarro@osmre.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM), National Technology Transfer Team (NTTT) plans on issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) requesting technical and cost proposals for applied science projects that have the potential for improving, in a manner that protects the public and the environment, the efficiency with which the coal industry conducts surface coal mining and reclamation activities and the regulatory authorities regulate these activities. Proposals submitted should be related to the topical areas identified by the NTTT as needing special emphasis. The general topical areas (to be further delineated in the RFP) include: hydrology issues: steep slope mining and reclamation: underground mine mapping; use of coal combustion by-products or other recycled materials; landscape stability; soil development on reclaimed lands: vegetation assessment; wildlife conservation and reforestation; and cropland reclamation. The RFP will be available to potential offerors on or about December 19, 2005. The Government anticipates awarding firm fixed price level of effort or cost reimbursement contracts with a performance period not to exceed one year and for amounts not exceed $100,000. The solicitation and any subsequent contract awards will be accomplished in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and FAR Part 35, Research and Development Contracting. Instructions for submission of the proposals will be described in Section L of the RFP. Evaluation Criteria for evaluating and ranking proposals will be provided in Section M of the RFP. Cost sharing for at least 25% of the proposed cost is recommended. All proposals must include a letter of endorsement (on official letterhead) signed by an appropriately authorized management official representing either a State, Indian or Federal Title IV or V Regulatory Authority under the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977. Proposals without this endorsement letter will not be considered. It is anticipated that funding will be available for the applied science projects. However, there is no guarantee that funds will be available for this purpose. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences. The small business size standard for the number of employees is 500. The RFP will be issued electronically via www.fedbizopps.gov or a hard copy of the RFP may be requested by e-mailing rnavarro@osmre.gov.

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 


2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Necessary Clearances:  The majority of the work to be performed will be at TOP SECRET; however, a portion of work may be performed at collateral SECRET. Work to be performed will require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Key personnel identified for assignment to the PANACIA effort must have an active TOP SECRET clearance at the time of award and be cleared for access to SI/TK information within three (3) months after award.

<DESC>The below RFI is amended to reflect that the due date for responses is extended to 4:00PM on 6 January 2006.

INTRODUCTION:  This Request for Information (RFI) concerns the United States Naval Academy (USNA) LEADERSHIP EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT (LEAD) Program.  The overall objective of the LEAD Program is to provide graduate education and preparation for talented, highly qualified Junior Officers to serve as Company Officers at the USNA and for continued future service in the Navy and Marine Corps.  The program develops students’ abilities to think critically and analytically, and focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for understanding, designing, and conducting leader and team development.  Each Company Officer leads and mentors a company of approximately 150 midshipmen.  Company Officers are the Academy’s primary leader and team developers, responsible for developing midshipmen morally, mentally, and physically.  Company Officers coach, counsel, and motivate, teach leadership courses, and act as officer representatives for athletic teams and extra-curricular activities.  Company Officers apply the graduate education garnered in the LEAD Program in an organizational, midshipmen company setting.

PURPOSE:  Historically, the USNA LEAD Program has met its overall objective of providing graduate education through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between USNA and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from accredited institutions about other potential program offerings that will satisfy the overall USNA objective of providing graduate education, while satisfying the specific objectives discussed below.  This information will be compared with the current (and any revised) program available from NPS.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  Educational and programmatic objectives follow.  All educational objectives must be met as they are considered mandatory for the fulfillment and proper execution of the LEAD Program.  Programmatic objectives include several which are mandatory and others which are preferred, the latter being highly desirable but not considered mandatory for the proper execution of the LEAD Program.  Mandatory objectives are coded (M) and preferred objectives are coded (P).
   
Educational Objectives:

Programmatic Objectives:

(M) One year timeframe - Students complete a master’s level graduate education in a one-year period (i.e., 1 June – 31 May).

(M) Greater Baltimore–Washington, D.C. metropolitan area - Students are designated as “LEAD Fellows” and are assigned for duty at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) in Annapolis, Maryland.  The graduate education must be completed in the greater Baltimore-Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  

(P) The program should capitalize on educational opportunities (e.g., academic field trips, site visits, access to senior governmental, military, and private sector officials, etc.) endemic to the greater metropolitan Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area.

(M) Cohort based education - Approximately 15-25 students (i.e., Junior Officers) complete all phases of the program as a cohort.

(M) Cohort recruitment, selection, and composition -
The LEAD cohort represents the finest Junior Officers from the Navy and Marine Corps, and selection is highly competitive.  Cohort membership will be determined by USNA and will be based on a broad range of selection criteria, including performance as a Junior Officer, potential for continued future service, and undergraduate academic performance.  

(M&P) Rich graduate education experience - The LEAD Program is typical of resident ‘gold standard’ graduate education, master’s degree producing programs, to include the next four items:

(1)(P) University campus setting - approximately 40 – 60% of 
the cohort’s education will occur at a university campus setting.

(2)(M) Accessible professors.

(3)(M) Availability of university academic, educational, and 
computational resources.

(4)(M)	This is not a distance education program.

(M) Assimilation to USNA - Some range (i.e., approximately 40 - 60%) of the cohort’s education will occur at USNA facilities.  This will provide students with the opportunity to assimilate to the unique USNA culture.  

(P) Similarly, professors with some degree of military experience or background are valued.

(M) Maximum educational appeal - The program is conducted by an accredited, prestigious university of the highest quality and selectivity.  The perceived appeal of the university and the degree program attracts the highest quality Junior Officers from the Navy and Marine Corps to compete for admission.

(P) Ease of administration - The program is contractually simple to execute.  Some form of per-student, per-cohort, or other flat-fee obligation serves as the basis of the contract.  USNA will not incur per diem, travel, lodging, or other miscellaneous or reimbursable costs associated with delivery of the educational product.  

(M) Minimize costs - Programmatic costs will be mitigated but not at the expense of educational quality.  Quality and cost both matter.  Reduced tuition costs are expected to accrue because of the cohort-based, annually renewable nature of the program.

(M) Company Officer indoctrination and training session
Approximately one-week at the end of the one-year program will be dedicated to formal Company Officer indoctrination and training.  This training will serve to facilitate the LEAD graduates’ transition to new duties as Company Officers.  USNA is responsible for execution of this phase of the program.  Proper coordination between USNA and any contracted university is necessary for scheduling and execution of the training.

The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) C2 Weapons and Sensors Development and Integration (MC2I) Program Manager (PM) for Radar Systems is seeking information from industry on their ability to provide a high fidelity Radar Environmental Simulator (RES) to support engineering, training and operational requirements.  It is the PM’s intent to adapt or develop a RES to work with the AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar and later with the Highly Expeditionary Long Range Air Surveillance Radar (HELRASR) and possibly the Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR).  The USMC RES program directly supports projects with the Missile Defense Agency, other DoD agencies, and foreign military sales programs.  Interested contractors are requested to describe proven, adaptable, fielded systems with customer references and points of contact.!    This request for information will assist the Marine Corps in responding to dynamic fluctuations in available fiscal resources and systematically present various courses of action, ranging from modifying existing equipment to procuring new systems. Sources replying to this request should address an initial capability of a radar simulator that will provide high fidelity simulation of Air Breathing Targets (ABT) with IFF returns, Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM), clutter, weather, jamming, etc.  Sources should address the RES’s ability to accurately replicate the AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar’s performance for detailed engineering analysis, satisfy validation and verification requirements for modeling and simulation and produce scenarios by digital injection and analog injection.  More specifically, sources are requested to address whether their recommended system is validated, verified, or certified to simulate TBMs by any agency or service test activity (i.e., MCOTEA, AFOTEC, ATEC, OPTEVFOR, etc).   Respondents should also address the following areas:  required operations and maintenance training, description of commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and software used, costs of the different approaches (digital, analog, and combinat!  ion), availability of logistics support, and On-Site support or Hotline support for Hardware/Software/Diminishing Material Sources/Obsolescence issues.  The system shall be two-man transportable, ruggedized and self-contained, excluding the power source.  Contractors are invited to read (only) the current AN/TPS-59 (V)3 Operational Requirements Document (ORD), draft 3DLRR ORD or the RES specification at Anteon Corporation (16 Center Street, Suite 105, Stafford, Virginia 22556) by coordinating a visit request in advance with Mr. Paul Flower at (540) 657-5302. Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted in writing to:  Ms. Lee Kerr, by 6 January 2006.  Please submit all information to Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Ms. Lee Kerr (MC2I), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.   THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking potential sources capable of performing Base Operating Services for Edwards AFB, CA. The services include Civil Engineering and Transportation (CE/Trans) tasks/functions at  Edwards AFB and all supported remote off-base locations.  See Attachment 1 of this synopsis for a list of some of the tasks involved in CE/Trans work.  The Government is currently performing Preliminary Planning in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.  Preliminary Planning is the process of determining if competitive sourcing is the optimal methodology for sourcing an organization’s commercial activities. The steps accomplished during Preliminary Planning result in market information and facts that lead to a defined business unit for competition and a Go/No Go decision on whether the requirement will be competitively sourced.  If Preliminary Planning results in a Go decision, an OMB Circular A-76 cost comparison will be conducted to determine the most cost-effective mode of operation. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be  a more cost-effective mode of operation.  Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience to: 95 CONS/PKB (Attn: Cindy Keim, 5 S. Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185 or e-mail cindy.keim@edwards.af.mil. Submissions should be limited to 15 pages and include evidence of similar past and present performance. Contractors must identify their business type (i.e., large, small, small and disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned small, HUBZone certified small, or service disabled veteran-owned small business). The NAICS code is 238990 Building and Property Specialty Trade Services and the size standard for small business is $12 million in annual receipts. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or to solicit offers from all responsible sources.  Responses will also assist the Government in determining the degree of commercial interest in this requirement.

<SUBJECT>A -- The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGR) Trial: Data Coordinating Center
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NICHD-DESPR-2006-03
<RESPDATE>121605

<DESC>Background:  Despite the fundamental nature of reproduction, for many it is a process fraught with frustration, inefficiency and imperfections, the effects of which can be severe. Infertility affects ten to 15 percent of couples attempting to conceive. Among all women who conceive, the incidence of spontaneous abortion has been estimated to be between 15 and 31 percent, and in many cases the cause is unknown. Additionally, of the four million births yearly in the United States, between eight and 15 percent will be born prematurely and experience increased morbidity and mortality as a result.  An intervention with even a small absolute effect on any of these outcomes has great implications at the population level because of the large potential attributable benefit.

Reproduction is a multi-stage process, and irregularities at any of these phases may be a sufficient cause of, or contribute to, negative outcomes.  Aspirin diminishes inflammation, increases vasodilation, and inhibits platelet aggregation.  It has been prescribed to subfertile or infertile women to improve outcomes at various stages of reproduction. Aspirin treatment for infertility has been shown to improve perfusion and increase endometrium thickness. In vitro fertilization (IVF) trials have suggested improved rates of implantation and pregnancies among women assigned to preconception aspirin supplementation compared with placebo. There are conflicting results among those with recurrent miscarriage.  Evidence supports aspirin treatment among women with anti-phospholipids antibody syndrome. In women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage syndrome, some studies have observed a treatment benefit while others have been inconclusive.  In studies of women with normal pregnancies and women at increased risk for preeclampsia, aspirin therapy starting at 12 weeks’ gestation has been shown to reduce preterm delivery, with a higher gestational age at birth among infants of those taking aspirin than placebo. 
	
The promising evidence in the IVF literature suggesting improved fecundity has been generated by studies too small to determine effects on pregnancy endpoints.  Larger studies of high-risk women not using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have begun treatment at 12 weeks’ gestation at the earliest, with some starting as late as 37 weeks.  It is unclear whether improved perfusion and blood flow early in pregnancy will improve pregnancy outcomes through reduction of early and late fetal losses, as well as improving fetal development. 

The NICHD is planning to conduct a trial to evaluate the effect of low-dose daily aspirin on reproduction at all phases beginning at preconception and continuing throughout pregnancy.   The trial will assess the effects of aspirin on each of these phases, including implantation and live births. 

Scope:  The trial will be a multi-site randomized controlled trial study design to achieve study objectives, with four study centers and one data coordinating center. Women aged 18 to 40 years, currently trying to become pregnant, and who have had a single spontaneous abortion in the past year will be eligible for the study. The overall for the trial recruitment goal is approximately 2000 women. Participating women will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Those randomized to treatment will receive daily low-dose aspirin (LDA). Those randomized to placebo will receive daily placebo. Both groups will receive folic acid daily in accordance with recommendations from the U.S. Public Health Service for prevention of birth defects. The duration of treatment regimens (LDA and folic acid or placebo and folic acid) will be two menstrual cycles, with those who become pregnant continuing until the end of pregnancy.
	
Study participants will be followed for the outcomes, including ovulation, determined using fertility monitors, implantation, and early pregnancy loss; clinically-recognized pregnancy, determined by presence of a fetal heartbeat from ultrasound scans; clinically-recognized spontaneous abortion; and information on stillbirth, gestational age, fetal growth, birth defects, and cesarean section. 
	
Samples collected that are not tested as part of the current protocol will be used to generate a specimen repository. The study population may be used as a cohort for future studies utilizing these samples and other information collected during the course of the study. 

Objective:  The primary objective of the trial is to help elucidate the effects of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid on the incidence of live births among those women who become pregnant relative to the placebo arm.
	
The effects of aspirin on uterine blood flow are expected to improve not only live birth rates, but also implantation, and to enhance retention of implanted trophoblasts.  Accordingly, the trial has the additional goals of evaluating the effects of aspirin therapy on various outcomes. Specifically, the NICHD plans to evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on incidence of hCG detected pregnancy, early loss of pregnancy, and on pregnancy outcomes.

Due to the population prevalence of early pregnancy loss, as well as of pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, study findings have the potential to have great impact if even small effects are observed. 


To be deemed capable to serve as the Data Coordinating Center for the trial, a small business must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability to:  
1) organize, conduct, and manage effectiveness trials involving the collection of data from multiple sources (include evidence of the ability to develop a detailed Manual of Operating Procedures; 
2) organize, conduct, and manage methods development and pilot studies; 
3) establish randomization protocol and evaluate eligibility criteria; 
4) assist the project officer in preparation of materials to be submitted for required reports and clearances for the IRB, OMB, etc.; 
5) monitor the quality of data collection, editing, auditing, and entry; 
6) develop and implement quality control procedures, including audits of field data collection procedures; 
7) train and certify data collectors in each of the Study sites; 
8) prepare data for statistical analyses; 
9) participate in the preparation of scientific articles and reports; 
10) develop statistical methodology in reproductive a perinatal epidemiology.


AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Charles Newman, Contracting Officer at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on December 16, 2005.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

Request for Information
Office of Fiscal Projection’s plan for a Forecasting and Cash / Investment Management System Designed to perform Mission Critical Functions at the Treasury Department 


Background

The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, Office of Fiscal Projection’s (OFP) is responsible for two mission-critical treasury functions: (1) producing daily forecasts of cash balances to determine Treasury’s marketable borrowing requirements, and daily debt levels to ensure that total debt outstanding does not exceed statutorial limitations, and (2) managing Treasury’s cash position and short-term investment portfolio. The daily cash forecasts, prepared for up to nine months in advance, are used by Treasury debt management officials to borrow sufficient funds to meet the Federal Government’s obligations as they become due. Increasing the accuracy of its cash flow projections would enable Treasury to reduce its borrowing costs. The daily debt estimates, also prepared for up to nine months in advance, provide early notification of future periods when Treasury debt levels are approaching (or expected to exceed) legislatively established levels.

To further improve its efforts to maintain an optimum level of liquidity, OFP needs to enhance the accuracy of its cash and debt forecasts. To achieve the ultimate goal of reducing errors in forecast, OFP needs to move towards a more rigorous cash / investment management system that can effectively address the two interdependent mission-critical responsibilities of the office. Much of the work today currently is accomplished using hundreds of intricately cross-linked spreadsheets. To gain operational efficiency, OFP needs to streamline the current process to the maximum extent possible. 

PURPOSE and SCOPE

OFP is seeking information from private entities that are qualified and experienced with development/design of forecasting and cash / investment management systems. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify solutions to store information in a centralized database and allow for complex cash and debt forecasting and cash / investment management. OFP requests that RFI responses address the requirements identified in this document. Special emphasis should be placed on the need for a robust system that is flexible in information retrieval and that can be customized to meet users’ requirements, and is easy to modify. Responses should reflect the following points as well as any additional recommended requirements or factors that the Government should consider. 

•	Innovation - Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing an integrated forecasting and cash / investment management system. 

•	Risk Management – help identify areas of opportunities for effective methods to forecast revenues and expenditures and manage a portfolio consisting of cash balances and short-term investments that mitigate potential risks in projecting Government’s fiscal position. 
     
•	Effective cash / investment management – provide an efficient way to streamline processes, ensure accuracy of data, and provide strong oversight of cash flow. Include real-time database updates upon data capture and entry.
 

Requirements

The functional requirements that the Government has identified for the proposed forecasting and cash / investment management system are detailed below. Responders are requested to provide the Government with their input related to these requirements. Additionally, responders are requested to suggest criteria or factors that the Government should consider in the development of the Request for Proposals should it choose to issue one.  

•	A secure central database to store both actual and forecasted data at detailed and summary levels as well as different time horizons (can assign receipt,  outlay and debt estimates on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual basis as well as user defined). 
  
•	The database should be able to accommodate data collected from a variety of sources and mechanisms (including through various automatic system-to-system connections) and store information over time. It is also critical to have a system that allows for a wide range of fast, flexible query capabilities, including ad hoc queries and statistical analysis.  

•	An easy to use system with a relatively low learning curve.

•	A capability that permits analysts to manipulate and analyze data. The system should be designed to handle the unique and frequently changing needs of OFP. 

•	A reporting system that captures forecasts and tracks and updates estimates. Also required is the ability to easily change reporting structure to support requirement changes. The system should have extensive tracking and reporting capabilities on the data in the warehouse and should be able to satisfy OFP’s reporting needs.  

•	An ability to calculate and analyze forecast errors and improve procedures to improve forecast accuracy.

•	An ability to provide Disaster Recovery capabilities with exceptionally limited down time.

•	An ability to provide secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) access.

•	An ability to support the collection of data from a wide variety of sources while meeting and maintaining all Federal Government security requirements.

PURPOSE:

THIS POSTING IS RE-ADVERTISED TO OPEN TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. PREVIOUS FEDBIZOPPS POSTING WAS FROM JULY 12, 2005 THROUGH JULY 22, 2005, FOR SOURCES SOUGHT, AND WAS FOR TOTAL SMALL BUSINESSES. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES INTERESTED, WERE DEEMED TO BE UNQUALIFIED TO PERFORM THE REQUIREMENT(S).   SEE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT BELOW.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  DATE OF AWARD THROUGH ONE YEAR

SPECIFIC OBJECT OF THE PROCUREMENT IS THE FOLLOWING:

Background

THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NATIONALS FAITH-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH ALL THE COLLABORATIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND TREATMENT AS MANDATED BY H.R. 4923.  THIS CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN JANUARY 2001, AND THE PRESIDENTS FAITH INITIATIVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECOVERY GRANTS ISSUED IN JUNE 2004, AUTHORIZED BY SECTIONS 501(D)(5) AND 509 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, AS AMENDED AND THE SECRETARY OF D.H.H.S, MIKE LEAVITT, 500 DAY PLAN ISSUED MAY 2005, CREATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among and society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.    In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, which expanded the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration. The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’S technical assistance for RY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to delver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards. Therefore, the goal of technical assistance activity for fiscal year 2005 is to assist faith and community organizations with successfully competing for SAMHSA grants awards.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.
INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.

THE BAA SUBJECT AREA is as follows: 
                                                
Background:

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has developed various devices to entangle the propellers of small outboard or inboard/outboard (IO) powered craft (length over all up to 40 feet, total power up to 675 HP using one or more outboard or I/O engines) that do not comply with orders to stop.  An existing system, the Running Gear Entanglement System (RGES) consists of a header-line with U-shaped loops of rope suspended below it.  It has been proven effective, but must be deployed by dragging it in front of the vessel to be stopped.  There is also an existing MK 10 version that is deployed by firing the RGES from a canister using compressed air.  The MK10 needs to be semi-permanently mounted on the vessel’s machine gun mount, thus interfering with the use of the vessel’s machine gun.  It can only be used from one side of the CG vessel, and cannot be fired more than once in any given mission or case.  Small craft such as CG rigid hull inflatables, port security boats or utility boats (UTBs) have a need for a more portable system that can be hand-fired and reloaded quickly.  The USCG has found that it’s relatively easy to fire a net into the water such that the net affixes itself to the lower unit.  The difficulty has been in getting the net to entangle the vessel’s propeller blades. 

The next step of research and development is broken into two phases.  Phase I produces a concept design and conducts a design review at the developer’s facility;  develops a working launching and entanglement concept demonstrator; delivers a test plan for Government approval, and conducts deployment and entanglement demonstrations against an outboard-powered planing boat.  Phase I also develops a test report and delivers one working concept demonstrator of the launching system and net.  Phase II makes any needed improvements and modifications and performs uniform testing of promising systems against a standardized target craft.   

Scope:  The scope of this BAA covers all of Phase I.

Requirements:

General:  The USCG is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) soliciting concept designs, proposed modifications of existing systems, and/or working prototypes of small portable net entanglement systems.  The “nets” shall be at least 50 feet in length, made of a suitable rope or twine to entangle one or more propellers on an outboard powered planing craft at least 15 feet in length.  The entire net/projectile assembly shall be easily recoverable.  Any projectile used to pull the net shall pose minimum risk of injury to persons onboard the vessel to be entangled.  Our experience indicates that many nets simply wrap around the lower unit of the engine above the anti-ventilation plates, fail to entangle the propeller, and sometimes slip off due to greater pull on one side of the net than the other.  Drag devices (e.g. small drogues) or diving planes on both ends of the net help to prevent it from slipping around the lower unit of an engine and to facilitate propeller entanglement, which is the desired end state; however, other proposed solutions are welcome.  The leading end of the net shall be capable of being propelled at least 100 feet from the launcher.  The system shall be re-loadable with a new net or net canister and propellant/charge mechanism in less than thirty seconds.  The net may be propelled using compressed air, a ballistic charge or other means.  The system shall be capable of surviving in a marine environment.  Compatibility with commercial line throwers, a twelve-gauge shotgun, 40 mm M-203 launcher, or other standard issue firearm is desirable but is not required.  Recoil shall be as low as possible to allow firing from a person’s shoulder, and exhaust gasses shall not pose a hazard to those behind the shooter.  Total weight of the system shall not exceed 30 pounds, and shall be able to be held and fired by a normal-sized person in a 25’ boat in “at sea” conditions.  

Deliverables: The offeror shall host a design review meeting at their facility once their concept design is completed, but before attempting to build their concept demonstrator.  The offeror shall also submit a draft test plan to the Government for review/comment prior to the design review meeting.  The offeror shall fabricate a working concept demonstrator and prepare a detailed test plan for Government approval.  The Government will conduct a Design Review meeting at the contractor’s facility.  The Government will then witness the offeror’s concept demonstrator deployed against a moving target of at least a 15-foot long outboard-powered planing craft.  The offeror shall then prepare and deliver a detailed test report including test results, prototype specifications, and estimated unit costs for quantities of one and one hundred systems. The offeror shall also deliver one working concept demonstrator system to the Government.

Schedule:

Phase 1 efforts shall be completed by August 31, 2006.  The Government anticipates Phase 2 work to be completed by August 31, 2007.    

Evaluation Criteria:  

(1)	Technical (two equally weighted subcriteria):

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The following questions (Q), and answers (A) are provided for the subject Broad Agency Announcement.  Due date is unchanged.
Q1.  A line-thrower type device needs to be developed to deploy the entanglement Cord (or net) in front of the target boat.  The line throwing device is to be shoulder fired and should be compatible with existing weapons (12 gauge, 20 mm launchers.  
A1.  Per the BAA, compatability with existing weapons is desirable but is not required.

Q2.  A more effective entanglement systems needs to be developed.  The new system can either by RGES like or net like  or something else as long as it entangles the propeller.
A2.  Per the BAA, we are most interested in an effective entanglement system, meaning one that actually entangles one or more propellers on an outboard powered planning craft at least fifteen feet in length.  

Q3.  Is there a specific target size boat that is needed to be stopped?  Does the device have to stop the forty foot 675 hp craft always or is that an extreme case which may require multiple entanglement devices?  
A3.  The requirements section of the BAA states the target size/speed of the boat.  The reference to forty feet 675 hp craft is in the Background section of the BAA.  Our desire is to ultimately be able to stop that size vessel.

Q4.  Are laboratory studies acceptable for evaluating prop entanglement?
A4.  No.  Per the BAA, prop entanglement shall be proven (demonstrated) during entanglement demonstrations witnessed by the Government.

Q5.  Is the $100K limit on the Phase 1 effort or will proposals for more be accepted?
A5.  The BAA states that total funding for tthis BAA is approximately $400,000. Individual awards will not exceed $100,000.

Q6.  Is the $400,000 expected to cover Phase II effort as well or is that a separate solicitation?
A6.  The scope of this BAA covers Phase I efforts.

<DESC>The above referenced combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to change a technical specification in response to a technical question submitted.

The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM Local Time on Friday, December 2, 2005, remains unchanged.

QUESTION:  I'm in process in preparing the quotation regarding the actual NIST bidding and I found a small inconsistency in the required specs.

Assuming bandwidth - limited pulses and a sech^2 pulse shape, the following relation is given: pulsewidth * bandwidth = 0.315
Calculating with an 7ps long pulse, the corresponding bandwidth is 0.17nm. On the other side the pulse duration corresponding to 0.05nm is 24ps. Typically the pulses of a Nd:vanadate picosecond laser are nearly bandwidth limited, which means a typical bandwidth corresponding to 7ps is around 0.2nm.  

Could you please comment on that.

RESPONSE: Upon receipt of this question, NIST noted that Specification (4) conflicts with Specification (7).  Therefore, Specification (4) is being modified.

Specification (4) is hereby changed to read as follows:
(4) Laser Bandwidth must be less than or equal to 0.2 nm;
