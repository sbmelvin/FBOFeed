At this time we anticipate a sole source award to Bullock Trane Service Company, Inc., 715 N Hogan, Spokane, WA 99202, for the following item: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, and materials to replace Compressor No. 2 in a Trane Air Conditioning Chiller Package located at Administration Building East, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee, WA. All work shall be in accordance with commercial and industry standards.  Compressor No. 2 failed and needs to be replaced.  The inspection of the system and an oil analysis indicates a severe electrical burn of the motor windings.  The debris from the burn, acids, carbon, etc. has been circulated throughout the refrigerant system and must be removed prior to operating the compressor.  The heat generated by the burn was sufficient to melt the seat out of the discharge service valve. Contractor will need to reclaim refrigerant charge from system No. 2, remove compressor, install a new discharge service valve and suction filter, furnish and install one new compressor on an exchange basis, furnish and install new filter drier cores, charge the system with new refrigerant and operate in a "clean-up" mode to remove residual contaminates,  replace suction and liquid filters, change the oil and operate in a second "clean-up" mode, test oil for any traces of acid and evaluate if further filter and oil changes are necessary, leak check new compressor, start compressor and verify operation, perform oil analysis and provide written report to the government. If there are any other firms who can provide the specified items and support, please provide enough detail about their equipment for adequate evaluation by the Government. Any respondents should mail their office and information as requested above to: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, P O Box 620, Code 7810, Grand Coulee, WA 99116, or fax to 509-633-9175 by March 31, 2005.

<DESC>1.  Background:  
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)/Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking interested parties to become partners of the TENTNET I program (herein referred to as TENTNET).  The purpose of the TENTNET is to make significant improvements in surge capabilities of military tentage products/systems by reduced lead-time, and improved availability with equal or improved quality and equal or reduced costs.  Members of TENTNET will be required to actively participate in scheduled workshops, meetings and short-time collaborative projects for the expressed purposes of arriving at scientific and technical solutions to improve the response of the military tentage industry and its supply chain to meet DLA needs.  These projects will improve manufacturing and supply chain logistics capabilities with the objective of enhancing DLA’s capability to provide logistics support to its customers.  It is DLA/DSCP’s mission to ensure the combat readiness and sustainment of American’s fighting forces by providing world-class logistical support of goods and services in peace and in war.  It is through the efforts of the TENTNET program that we seek to advance these essential shelter services to our war fighters around the globe.  

The focus of this program is to focus on the manufacturing and supply chain logistics functions associated with military tents/shelters managed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP).  This focus addresses all aspects of the military tentage supply chain while recognizing that the program success depends on the integration of military tentage suppliers into the military supply chain in terms of both peacetime and surge requirements.  To accomplish this TENTNET must develop the tools to assist DLA/DSCP in managing inventories and develop the decision support capability and the methodology to improve the manufacturing surge capability and replenishment process.  The focus of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to build on existing efforts of the various Military Services and DLA/DSCP in military tentage supply chain management and identify and explore expanded manufacturing and supply chain logistics capabilities for military tent and shelters.

2.  General Information:
The TENTNET program is projected to be a $1.5 million per year DLA Research & Development (R&D) effort focused on improving DLA’s ability to meet operational tentage requirements, now and in the future.  The period of performance of the contemplated program is expected to be 7 years with a 3 year base period and two 2-year option periods. 

Interested parties are required to submit a proposal that consists of a Proposed Short Term Project and a section that separately addresses the factors identified in the proposal evaluation criteria section of this BAA.  The Short Term Project should provide information which demonstrates the Offeror’s capabilities to meet the evaluation criteria.  The purpose of the proposal is to evaluate the offeror’s ability to plan, perform and implement a Short Term Project.  Technical Proposals in response to this BAA shall be no longer than twenty five (25) pages. (Pages should be 8 ½ x11” with at least a one-inch margin on all sides, using Times New Roman font on 12 pt. size or larger in body text.)  Offeror shall submit 10 copies of their proposal and 2 copies of the Cost Proposal (cost proposal shall be a separate volume). 

The primary objective of this program is for TENTNET partners to work with government representatives and network with each other to identify, initiate and complete short-term projects that develop and adapt modern manufacturing and supply logistics technologies to be implemented within the industrial base to assure the prompt and sustained availability, quality and affordability of military tentage.  Subject to the availability of funds, a total Government investment for about $1.5 million per year for 7 years is planned during Fiscal Years 2005-2011.  This investment will be for funding of partnership contracts and future short-term projects (STPs).  It is anticipated that partners chosen to participate will be eligible to receive an estimated amount of $15,000 per calendar year for authorized travel and related costs for participation in and attendance of TENTNET workshops.

Offerors must submit the hard copies with an electronic file of the full proposal and refer to BAA 05-0002 by 3:00 P.M. local Philadelphia time on May 4, 2005, to DSCP-Business Opportunities Office, Bldg. 36, 2nd floor, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA  19111 in order to be considered.

No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government’s needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA.  DSCP encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions to submit proposals under this BAA.  However no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the point of contact listed in the synopsis; email or fax is preferred.  Proposals MAY NOT BE submitted by fax or EMAIL; any so sent will be disregarded.  

It is the Government’s intention to award “partner” contracts based upon the short term project task proposed that demonstrate knowledge, experience, and expertise in the technical areas of interest identified below.  The offeror’s proposal must demonstrate an understanding in one or more of those technical areas of interest, or an area directly related to but not listed.  Proposals must provide information on past performance, which reflects related efforts and/or achievements, technological aptitude, management support, and potential contribution and relevance to DLA’s mission.  The submitted STP will be used for evaluation purposes only and may or may not be awarded.  Future STP’s submitted by selected partners will be evaluated using the same evaluation criteria listed in this BAA.

3.  Areas of Interest:

The potential technical areas of interest include, but are not limited to, supply chain integration, asset visibility, (quality and quantity recognition), materials, systems, manufacturing methods and procedures, software tools, operations processes, equipment, devices, and quality assurance for military tents and tent systems.

Successful offerors will be required to develop Short Term Projects (STPs) to address all, or selected aspects, of one or more of the above areas of and the DLA integrated supply chain for Military Tentage.  The vision of this R&D effort encompasses manufacturing, system integration and process management of all aspects of the military tentage supply chain.

Please note that another DLA sponsored program, the Apparel Research Network (ARN), has ongoing major initiatives in the area of supply chain management in the capture of accurate consumption data, asset visibility for management of supply chain inventories, and automation of supplier processes.  Offerors should not propose any STP which would duplicate or overlap the efforts already underway and results achieved under the ARN.  ARN will expand its scope to incorporate all tentage and related items to its existing and developing systems.  (For further details please go the ARN web site:  ARN2.com)

The initial award under the TENTNET will be a core Partner contract, which provides opportunities for Partners to further interact with government representatives and to work with other Partners to develop and further refine valid STPs for future awards.  Each organization participating in the performance of this program is a partner in the TENTNET.  The collection of these partners is known as the TENTNET.  The Government’s preference for partner prior experience is in domestic manufacturing capability for military and/or commercial tentage and related products.  Each partner is required to bring specific technical expertise that lends itself to significant improvements of the military tent industry’s ability to meet DLA tentage needs.

The focus of TENTNET is for all partners to actively and continuously assist DLA in improving its ability to meet/exceed a varying range of military requirements through research, development and technology transfer efforts as they apply to the tentage and related industries.

All TENTNET research and development efforts are expected to improve manufacturing and supply chain logistics capabilities by identifying targets for improvement, with the final goal being shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead costs, and improved quality.  Improved production methods for military and civilian products that enhance producer flexibility are desirable.  Proposed research and development should investigate innovative approaches that enable significant advances in manufacturing technology, devices or systems and then describe a path for implementation in the manufacturing facilities and its supply chain of tent and related items producers.

The program and this call for proposals consist of a Tent Network for Technology Implementation (TENTNET) partnerships.  The TENTNET consists of a group of individual organizations participating in the program, each of which is a partner in the TENTNET.  The network of organizations includes, but is not limited to, universities, tent manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, equipment suppliers, material suppliers, and software developers.

Each potential TENTNET partner is required to bring a specific tent and related product manufacturing/operations technical expertise to advance the state-of-the-art of technology and to facilitate its implementation into the military tent industry and supply chain that supports the military needs.  Primary consideration in the selection of a TENTNET partner will be the relevancy of the offeror’s past and present manufacturing and logistics related experience and technical expertise as it relates to the potential for significantly improving the military tent industry’s ability to meet DLA requirements.  Each year the TENTNET partners will be required to attend Government sponsored workshops for the purpose of participating in the TENTNET process of 1)planning technical strategy; 2)identifying, developing and performing STPs and; 3)reporting to the government program management of the TENTNET.  Each partner will be reimbursed for their attendance at these workshops and other related TENTNET meetings.  Allowable and allocable reimbursable costs will include airfare, direct labor, car rentals/taxis/shuttles and a per diem for food and incidentals in accordance with the Federal Joint Travel Regulations.

As part of the contract performance requirements, partners will be required to submit research ideas for implementation of short-term projects.  A short-term project is defined as a collaborative applied research and development effort aimed at improving specific elements of the military tentage production cycle with a clear technological application and implementation process.  The duration of a typical STP is under 24 months.  Prior to initiating performance of STPs, all research ideas/proposals that may be submitted by any  partner may be presented at a Government sponsored workshop for review and approval.  In response to the research idea presented, and at the Government’s discretion, a funded delivery order or modification may be awarded under the TENTNET core partner contract for the execution of the STP with emphasis on implementation of results.  Partners who are conducting STPs will be required to submit monthly progress and financial reports and a final technical report.  The statement of work and resulting contract modification will specify requirements, including Contract Data Requirements. 

The following format (Paragraph 1 through 6) – outlines the offeror’s minimal requirements for submitting research short term projects (STPs).  Each proposed STP will include the following:

(1) Degree to which proposed new and creative solutions to technical issues are important to the DSCP/DLA Tent Industrial Base program and can be implemented in the supply chain (see potential technical areas of interests identified above).

(2) Feasibility and the offeror's understanding of the technical objectives and proposed approach.  

(3) The offeror's ability to achieve and implement results with the proposed approach, as demonstrated by earlier specific contractor accomplishments in the technical fields involved, by availability of qualified personnel, and by availability of appropriate facilities.  Additionally, explain how the project will be managed, how results will be demonstrated, and how success will be measured.  Address management organization, tools, controls, methodologies, milestone events and performance duration and describe suitable alternatives to establish a pathway for technology transfer.

(4) The degree to which technical data and/or computer software (where applicable) will need to be developed under the proposed STP, and the processes to monitor and control new process devices and equipment.  (All technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to the Government with unrestricted rights.) CAUTION:  Any development of software is subject to review and approval by DLA against the BSM program for compatibility (e.g. duplication of effort, functionality and operability.)  Address technical methodologies and technology transfer mechanisms that will be utilized to solve the problem and demonstrate the realism of the timetable and risks (time, cost, risk of failure) associated with the approach.  In the technical proposal of your STP identify the portions that you intend to perform in house and the portions that you intend to subcontract, if any.

(5) Proposed estimated cost and duration.  Costs of actual STPs will be viewed not only in relation to the prospective value of the proposal, but also to the availability and level of Government funding for the TENTNET program.  (If the submitted proposal’s dollar value is estimated to be over $500,000, large business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.) 

(6)  Inclusion of a tangible or intangible cost/benefits for the proposed effort.

PROPOSAL EVALUATION

This section identifies the evaluation criteria for TENTNET  proposals.

The selection of multiple sources for contract awards will be based on a technical review by designated Government representatives of all proposals submitted in response to this BAA.  Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine relevancy of the offeror’s past performance, relative technical merit, management approach, and the probability of implementing results for the benefit of DLA.   
 
The Government will evaluate all proposals in accordance with the following criteria set forth below.  It is the Government’s intent to make multiple awards to TENTNET partners, among industry and academia.  The actual number of contract awards will be commensurate with all evaluation results; and consideration of those respondents which provide the most promising and beneficial proposals within the technical areas of consideration, and as funding will permit.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) has issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) to submit Sealed Bids from all NATO countries to support the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) plan for a civil works project at the Forward Support Base (FSB) in Herat, Afghanistan (ISAF Engineering Project 064 - FSB Herat). This project will be funded by the NATO Security Investment Program with a potential estimated cost of over 6.7 million Euros ($9 million USD).

This project has been split into three separate reports, all with their own individual serial numbers:

1. IS Document AC/4(PP)/D/25010 dated 24 February 2005, ISAF/Civil Works-HERAT, OPLAN 10302, Airfield Operating Facilities, Serial 2005 / 5VA30288-0 (ISAF ENG 064 A).

2. IS Document AC/4(PP)/D/25011 dated 23 February 2005, ISAF/Civil Works-HERAT, OPLAN 10302, Provide Passenger and Cargo Handling Facilities, Serial 2004 / 5VA30289-0 (ISAF ENG 064 B&C).

NAMSA was nominated as Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee (IC) of the North Atlantic Council at their meeting (05)0006 held on 01 March 2005. The reference of the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is IFIB-ISAF-ENG064 and all correspondence concerning this procurement shall reference this number.

1. IFIB REFERENCE #

IFIB / ISAF / ENG 064

2. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Airfield Operating Facilities (ISAF ENG 064 A):

Construction of an apron for parking of 2 Fixed Wing (FW) Tactical Transport Aircraft and associated connecting taxiways. SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) requested a 125m (width) x 120m (depth) platform, which is in accordance with the provisions of the Airfields Criteria and Standards (C&S). The connecting taxiways must be 15m wide rather than the requested 12m, to fulfill the C&S requirements. The loading capacity of the pavement is to be LCN 50.

2.1.2. Parking for Medium Utility Helicopters

Construction of a parking/maintenance apron and associated connecting taxiways for 6 Medium Utility (CH-53) helicopters, providing 6 individual spots of 48m x 54m (width =  two rotor diameters and length = length of the helicopter plus one rotor diameter), in accordance with the provisions of the existing draft C&S for Helicopters. The pavement must provide a loading capacity of LCN 50.

2.1.3. QRA Parking for Attack Helicopters

Construction of QRA parking aprons for attack helicopters (AH-64) and associated connecting taxiways, providing 4 individual spots 30m x 33m (width = two rotor diameters and length = length of the helicopter plus one rotor diameter), in accordance with the provisions of the existing draft C&S for Helicopters. The pavement must provide a loading capacity of LCN 30.

Construction or revetment walls between parking aprons. Together with sufficient spacing between parking spots, they will prevent sympathetic detonation in the event of an explosion at one of them. A container for temporary ammunition and the respective base platform, are included in the scope.

2.1.4. Other Works

The scope of the project includes the provision of the taxiway edge lighting, flood lighting for the parking platforms and grounding and anchoring for each of the aircraft spots. The Staff understands that these will follow the provisions of the C&S. In addition, a total of 2,200m of fence will have to be restored to improve the security of the Forward Support Base (FSB) perimeter.

According to the November 2004 RECCE report, there is a low risk of UXO (unexploded ordnance) at the FSB. Nevertheless, it is considered necessary to have an EOD team to sweep and clear the affected areas of any UXO. It is estimated that this clearance action will take 5 days.

2.2. Provide Passenger and Cargo Handling Facilities (ISAF ENG 064 B&C):

The scope of the project is essentially the provision and installation of a containerized or pre-fabricated facility for passenger handling with 300m2 (equivalent to 20 containers) and pre-fabricated facility for cargo handling with an approximate area of 140m2. It includes foundation works, utilities, and transportation costs.

2.2.1. Passenger Terminal

The passenger terminal will be able to handle two loads of C-130 passengers simultaneously. The requested area of 300m2 accounts for a space per passenger of 2.5m2, plus terminal desks, x-ray and weighing equipment. Due to the possibility of having several hours of waiting between onward movements, it is also necessary to provide 2 ablution containers for toilets and hand-wash facilities.

2.2.2. Cargo Handling Facility

The cargo handling facility will have an open bay layout, and an administrative space (three positions). The total area is 140m2 and is based upon four times the area of a C-130 cargo bay (load out, load in, work area for MHE, and administrative space) plus 10% allowance. The structure of the facility is pre-fabricated, standing on a concrete pavement capable of withstanding a 2.5 tons wheel load. The loading/unloading doors must be 16m wide. Exterior lighting is also part of the scope.

2.3. Provide Bulk Fuel Installation (ISAF ENG 064 D):
	
The scope of the project is the provision and installation of a Bulk Fuel Installation (BFI) with a storage capacity of 1150m3 of aviation fuel (F34) and 270m3 of diesel fuel (F-54). These numbers are based on the daily requirements of the aircraft and vehicles that will be operating from or supported by the FSB.

3. SOLICITATION CONCEPT

3.1. The NAMSA Contracting Officer will require prospective contractors to acknowledge within 72 hours of receipt of IFIB its receipt and request them to state their bidding interest. The bidders will be informed that the Contracting Officer will limit further communications to those firms that return acknowledgement of receipt, and indicated a desire to continue with the ICB process.

3.2. It is foreseen to award a single contract to a prime contractor covering the scope of the three projects. However, the Contracting Officer will consider splitting the award, if the results of the solicitation indicate that such splitting would be in the interest of NATO.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to modify an existing contract, No. PBGC01-CT-04-0685 with Booz Allen & Hamilton (BAH) who is currently developing the Case Administration System (CAS) redesign.  This work is the continuation of services to provide re-engineering/developing services, sustaining engineering or maintenance services, and operational and production support services for a suite of approximately eight PBGC custom-designed software applications.  There’s a need to increase the estimated level of effort which will meet management’s requirements and schedule for this project. The increased level of effort will allow for additional personnel to:  (1) expedite the development of the CAS redesign. The software development will utilize the FileNet P8 business process management (BPM) product to redesign the current CAS suite of applications into one BPM tool. The current CAS suite of applications will be redesigned into one application – Case Management System (CMS); and (2) enhance the User Provisioning Tool (UPT) to incorporate functionality and improve performance.  The UPT is a security tool developed to leverage the Service Oriented Architecture at PBGC to control access to applications and plan information.   It is in the best interest of the PBGC for the current provider to complete this work by modifying the existing contract which will ensure continuity of work and accuracy in the execution.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is issuing an Invitation for Bid for the Town Pond Restoration, Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Town Pond is located in Portsmouth, Rhode Island adjacent to Mount Hope Bay. The modern historical condition of the Town Pond a rea was tidally influenced open water prior to a Corps navigation improvement project placing dredged material in the area in the early 1950s. At that time, tidal exchange to the interior marsh was effectively halted. The Town Pond Restoration Project call s for a combination of fifty-percent salt marsh-fifty percent open water/intertidal habitats with on-site disposal of excavated material. This was selected as the best overall plan for habitat restoration, aesthetic acceptability and affordability. An esti mated 126,000 cubic yards of existing dredged material would be excavated to promote restored tidal exchange to Town Pond. Over time, the interior marsh will be transformed from a lower value brackish habitat to a high value salt pond and salt marsh habita t. The excavation and regrading of the area to reach the new profile will require the establishment of an effective plan for control and diversion of water. There will be some vegetation removal in the staging and access areas (approximately 1 to 2 acres o f upland vegetation at the southeastern end of the site off Anthony Road) on the Roger Williams College property. The size of disturbance of the staging area, access roads and temporary haul roads will be limited to the minimum necessary for construction a ccess and a line of erosion control devices will be established along the perimeter. Temporary haul roads will be removed following their use and these and other areas will be allowed to revegetate following construction. Areas with severe slopes or distur bed soils with a high potential to affect water quality will be replanted to limit erosion. A small area of salt marsh (approximately 80 square feet) will be destroyed to deepen and realign the entrance channel inlet. Salt marsh plants there will be remove d by others prior to construction and planted along the new channel alignment to reestablish a salt marsh cordgrass fringe resulting in no net change in wetland area. Approximately 18 acres of phragmites, which is above the elevation of tidal influence, wi ll be removed to restore salt marsh and estuarine habitat. Once the new elevations are established and are flooded by frequent tides estuarine habitats and vegetation communities will establish. There are two concrete structures that will be built as part of the project. A 45-foot long, 42-inch diameter culvert with concrete headwalls will replace a smaller old culvert that will be removed and a concrete weir approximately 38 feet long will be built to regulate a permanent pool where the entrance channel me ets the interior marsh. The plan requires some phragmites wetland filling to construct a water control berm along the west side of the site to prevent flooding of Founders Brook by salt water. The water control berm would fill approximately 3.2 acres of w etland and the public access area would fill approximately 0.35 acre of wetland. The berm would be covered by 6 inches of approved cap material and seeded with coastal grass and shrubs would be planted along the top. Some excavated material would be used t o construct a 6,750 square foot parking area with an entrance off of Anthony Road. The restoration plan has on-site disposal of excavated material in phragmites wetlands. The plan would require 7 acres of wetland fill. The disposal area will be covered by 6 inches of approved cap material and seeded with coastal grasses (e.g. switchgrass) after construction is complete to create a coastal grass community. During the construction phase, there will be provisions to allow continued maintenance access to the ex isting electric transmission lines that run through the project area.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.   MARCORSYSCOM requests information from industry to determine the state of technology concerning the development, integration, and production of items or systems similar to the Marine Corps’ Universal Communications Interface Modules (UCIM).  The intent of the market research is to get feedback from a wide array of sources to determine if there are any currently available technologies (e.g. NDIs) or technologies that can be quickly developed or procured, and integrated.

<DESC>Sources are sought that can provide or equal products for three brand name items as described below.  The New York District intends to solicit and award a construction project for the United States Military Academy (USMA), West Point, NY entitled t he Architectural/Structural Restoration to Michie Stadium.  The project itself will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation.  However, the project may potentially include  three brand name components.  This notification serves three purposes :  1) To notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to specify three brand name components under a future construction project; (2) To identify potential sources that can provide any or all of the brand name items; and (3) Notification of the Gov ernments intent to brand name specify resultant products or systems.  A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an or equal prod uct is not submitted for consideration.  In such instances the brand name  or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring  brand name components will be sole sourc e if no sources are able to provide an or equal product.  Suppliers will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.  In the event no or equal s  exist, the brand name justifications will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source. Description of Work: The products included in this market survey are associated with the cleaning and rehabilitation of concrete surfaces at Michie Stadium in West Point NY.  The areas of work associated with the commercial blasting products include the North, West and South seating decks of the original 1920s era stadium. All topside surfaces of these seating decks are to be blasted clean of all coatings, parges and previous patches. The work includes both horizontal and vertical (risers) surfaces. Additionally, the cast in place concrete field wall and parapet walls that surround and enclose the seating decks are included as are the cement plaster surfaces of the North and So uth towers and the East facades of the North and South Stands.  The commercial blasting product is/may also be used as an alternate method of removing paint from the steel railings. A small portion of the railings have been identified as containing lead based paint. There is approximately 840 LF or railing being cleane d and repainted, of which approximately 150 LF of it contains lead. Primary concerns related to the blasting products are: ·	Careful control of the amount of material removed in order to assure that no damage is done to the structural concrete or original cement plaster substrates.  ·	Minimize the amount of residue produced and the clean-up thereof.  ·	Dust control ·	Access to the playing field is for equipment or vehicles is very limited. Products must make use of portable compressors or compressors with sufficient power to allow for long hose lengths.  ·	Silica blasting is to be avoided due to concerns over dust and applicator protection ·	If used to remove lead based paint from steel railings both products can be used to contain the lead. The sponge media encapsulates the paint naturally. The Turbo product can be used for lead containment with the addition of an admixture. The corrosion inhibiting impregnation coating is to be applied to the same reinforced concrete surfaces of  the North, West and South seating decks of the original 1920s era stadium. All topside surfaces of these seating decks are to be coated on both hor izontal and vertical (risers) surfaces. Additionally, the cast in place concrete field wall and parapet walls that surround and enclose the seating decks are included.  Summary of  Requirement: A corrosion inhibiting impregnation coating for hardened concrete surfaces is required to penetrate the surface and diffuse in vapor or liquid form to the steel reinforcing bars embedded in the concrete.  The impregnation coating is to form  a protective l ayer on the steel surface which inhibits corrosion caused by the presence of chlorides as well as by carbonation of concrete.  The impregnation coating is to penetrate up to 3 inches in 28 days.  The impregnation coating is to form a protective layer of hi gh integrity up to 100 A in thickness on the reinforcing steel.  Sika FerroGardâ 903 or equal. A commercial and industrial blasting technology is required to remove all the layers of coatings from the concrete structure of Michie Stadium.  The layers of coatings to be removed include a variety of cementious parges in depths ranging from skim coating s to approximately 3/16 thick each. A nylon reinforcing mesh is present in some locations. The total depth of the coating systems is approximately 3/8 of an inch. The parged coatings have also been painted numerous times. The paints and coatings on the con crete typically do not contain lead.  The blasting technology will also be used for the preparation (removing paint) of the existing metal pipe rails prior to repainting. Some of these rails are painted with lead based paint and the required blasting techn ology should have the capacity for entrapping contaminants making it effective for use on lead painted surfaces. Sponge BlastingTM System or the Turbo Wet Abrasive Blasting System or equal. Any supplier wishing to provide an or equal for the Sika FerroGardâ 903, the Sponge BlastingTM System, or the Turbo Wet Abrasive Blasting System must provide supporting data to the Contracting Officer no later than 01 April 2005 to Anne Spiegelberg, U.S.  army Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New York, NY, 10278-0090.  This is a market survey and sources sought only.  This is a notification of the Governments intent to incorporate brand name or equa l components for the  project.  The Government does not intend to solicit these components as stand-alone, independent contract actions.  This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date.

<SUBJECT>A -- Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Technology Assessment for Air Vehicles Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Immunity (AVE3I)
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate, Power Division (AFRL/PRP) and the Air Force Research Laboratory Air Vehicles Directorate, Control Sciences Division (AFRL/VAC) are announcing their intent to conduct an Industry Day for the Power and Thermal Technologies For Air And Space— Technology Assessment for Air Vehicles Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Immunity (AVE3I) Program on 6-7 April 2005 at the Hope Hotel Conference Center in Fairborn Ohio, near Wright-Patterson AFB.  The objective of this Industry Day is to provide information regarding the Technology Assessment for AVE3I Program and allow for networking to be initiated between interested parties.

The Industry Day Conference will begin at 0800 on 6 April 2005.  The agenda includes: introductions by conference attendees; a program overview presentation by the Government, followed by private one-on-one Government/Industry discussions.  

During the introduction period, attendees will be permitted to stand in place, introduce their team and provide a brief description of their company’s capabilities and interests.  This introduction will be strictly limited to two minutes.  The Government’s formal presentation will begin after conclusion of introductions.  Subsequent to the Government’s presentation, private one-on-one discussions will be conducted between the Government and interested conference attendees.  One-on-one discussions may overflow to the next day depending upon the number of responses received.  The one-on-one discussions will be by appointment only.  

The objective of the Technology Assessment for AVE3I Program is to design, develop, integrate and ground test subsystems, which provide immunity to air vehicles Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (EEE).  Current fly-by-wire air vehicles are susceptible to self-induced and externally generated EEE.  The interested conference attendees will be asked to determine which critical subsystems are more susceptible to these emissions and demonstrate solutions to provide immunity to these effects.  The interested conference attendees will prioritize these subsystems then select one subsystem to develop, integrate and test.  The emphasis of the effort will be on the development of technologies and subsystem architectures followed by integration and demonstration of an EEE immune subsystem by 2008.  

The developed and demonstrated subsystem shall be traceable to a lightweight, efficient air vehicle design, but for this effort, it is not required to meet these specifications.  Although weight, size and efficiency need to be considered during design and development, it is not expected that flight worthy hardware will be developed at this stage.

The Government anticipates multiple contract awards with an estimated total program value ranging from $11M to $20M and a program performance period of approximately three years.

The Technology Assessment for AVE3I Program will involve classified information, as well as military critical technical data.  The information presented by the Government during the Industry Day briefing will be unclassified.  However, military critical technical data will be discussed therefore, only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), 74 Washington Ave. N, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-877-352-2255) that have a legitimate business purpose will be permitted to attend. 

Interested parties are required to pre-register to attend the Industry Day briefing and pre-schedule the one-on-one sessions.  Conference registration must be submitted on company letterhead and be signed by a corporate official.  Registration must include a list of personnel attending Industry Day, affirmation that all listed personnel are U.S. citizens, a copy of an approved DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement and, if desired, your request to be scheduled for a one-on-one government/industry session.

<SUBJECT>A -- Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) Power Systems Workshop
<DESC>Special Notice:  Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) Power Systems Workshop

UUV Power Systems Workshop, SN05-18.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring an informational/teaming workshop for a potential new DARPA UUV Power Systems program.  This potential program would explore innovative technologies for enabling future long duration UUV missions.  Current UUV missions are limited to several hours to several days due to the energy storage limitations of the batteries used for propulsion and payload power systems.  DARPA/DSO recognizes that extending future UUV missions from several days to several weeks will require innovative UUV system designs as well as major advances in energy storage and power generation technologies.  Of particular interest to this potential program are hybrid approaches that combine advanced power generation and energy storage technologies with multifunctional concepts that integrate energy storage with UUV structural materials and components.  Innovative and revolutionary materials, subsystems and systems design/integration/configuration concepts are strongly encouraged.    

The workshop will be held at the Turf Valley Resort located in Ellicott City, Maryland on April 20, 2005.  The goals of the workshop are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the UUV Power Systems program vision and goals; and (b) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential research organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the UUV Power Systems program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the workshop participants.  Additionally, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/UUVPowerTeaming/

Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to an anticipated DARPA UUV Power Systems solicitation.  Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session.  A maximum of 25 4ft. by 4 ft. posters can be accommodated.  Workshop details (including registration information) are given on the UUV Power Systems website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/index.asp?meetingid=329
The password is UUV2005.

The workshop registration fee is $75.00 and includes all workshop activities.  Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 attendees) and early registration is strongly recommended.  The registration cutoff date is Tuesday, March 29, 2005 at 5 pm EST, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  DARPA/DSO anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that a solicitation will follow the workshop.  Further administrative information is available from Michelle Mann (mannm@sainc.com).  Additional technical information can be obtained from Valerie Browning (vbrowning@darpa.mil) or Leo Christodoulou (lchristodoulou@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the UUV Power Systems workshop in correspondence.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time.

This laser should l also produces stable continuous wave energy in the required wavelengths listed below.  This multi-line laser will form the basis of a capital improvement to human performance laboratory and is required to support a number of wavelengths simultaneously, and be able to sequentially switch between colors in a prescribed sequence.  Continuous tune-ability of the laser is not a requirement, but the laser lines (or colors) indicated below must be available in an immediate and programmable fashion. The laboratory is currently performing an increasing number of frequency agile experiments in which the efficacy of modulating continuous wave laser waveforms across color and time to impede visual performance will be investigated.   

    a.  Required output power:

          13.0 Watts “white” output from 458nm to 647nm
            4.0 Watts “red” output at 647nm
            0.2 Watts “yellow” output at 575nm
            4.5 Watts “green” output from 521mm to 497mm
            3.9 Watts “blue” output from 488nm to 476nm
            0.3 Watts “deep blue” output at 458nm
	
    b.	Output wavelengths are achieved without changing any optical elements within the laser.

    c.	The laser resonator is not be made from any graphite composite material.

    d.	The laser should automatically align itself to a lasing condition from a non-lasing condition with no requirement for the user to open the laser head cover or align cavity mirrors.

    e.	The laser should automatically realign cavity mirrors to optimize cavity alignment and achieve maximum output power, lowest optical noise, and best transverse mode structure. Systems that actively control only beam pointing is not acceptable because they do not maximize output power, minimize optical noise, or optimize transverse mode.

    f.	The laser is supplied with a remote control module and provide provides latching fault diagnostic displays and all controls necessary to operate and monitor the laser and heat exchanger.

    g.  The laser should have an integral shutter that is located outside of the laser cavity and is capable of blocking the output beam without interrupting lasing.  This shutter should be remotely controlled to allow its opening and closing.  The shutter should be capable of being used with a safety interlock system such that when the door to the laboratory is opened; the shutter will close and block the laser beam.

    h.	The laser system should include an automatic gas pressure monitoring and filling system to maintain optimized plasma tube pressure.

    i.	The system should be supplied with an interface to allow its use with laboratory computers.

    j.	The heat exchanger should be a closed system interfaced with the laser system for power and control.   The heat exchanger should automatically turns on when the laser is turned on, and continues circulating water in the secondary cooling loop for a period of at least 5 minutes after laser system is turned off, at which time the heat exchanger will turn itself off.

    k.   In order to fit under our optical table, the power supply and heat exchanger must each measure no more than 20” high, 20” wide, and 23” deep.

    l.	The heat exchanger should shut down the laser in the event that water flow drops below allowable levels, cooling water temperature rises above allowable levels, or resistivity of secondary cooling water drops below allowable levels.

    m.	  Heat exchanger should display the temperature, water flow rate, and resistivity of the secondary cooling water loop on the laser remote control module to allow the operator to monitor critical cooling water parameters.

    n.	Cooling water for the laser head and power supply should be provided from an integral closed-loop heat exchanger.

    o.	The laser, power supply, and any heat exchanger should includes an appropriate user’s and maintenance manual.

    p.  The entire laser system should be warranted for at least one year.

 STATEMENT OF WORK
COAST GUARD ANTI-ICE STUDY
1	GENERAL.
1.1	Background:  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates 84 ground based un-manned Differential Global Positioning (DGPS) broadcast sites throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Each DGPS site is configured in one of three versions: (1) DGPS site with a long-wire, whip, top-loaded Polestar, or with a hot (un-grounded) antenna tower that is 90’, 120’, or 150’ in height and using a Southern Avionics Company (SAC) SC-1000 transmitter; (2) DGPS site using a SC-1000 transmitter connected to a hot 299’ antenna tower; and, (3) DGPS site using an RCA transmitter connected to a hot 299’ antenna tower.  All 84 DGPS sites are susceptible to weather effects, such as hot and dry deserts, snow, ice, freezing rain, and dry and wet weather.  One of the most significant weather affect to any DGPS site is icing.  When ice forms on all antenna tower surfaces, including structural and antenna guy cables, and all tower base and antenna cable insulators, the Coast Guard’s DGPS broadcast signal is shorted to ground resulting in significant signal attenuation or complete signal loss.  Most DGPS(V)1 sites with towers 150’ and less (not including non-typical long-wires, whips, or Pole Star antennae) use synthetically ribbed Salvar® insulators between the Top Loading Elements (TLE) cables and the grounded portions of the TLE extensions to ground, which greatly reduces the shorting effect ice has over standard smooth cable insulators.  Some DGPS(V)1 and all DGPS(V)2 and (V)3 sites use 48 (35 inch) fiberglass smooth insulators for all TLE cables, one smooth tower-base, and 54 smooth structural support cable insulators per tower.  Icing and freezing rain severely affects all DGPS sites with smooth cable insulators.  The Coast Guard is interested in identifying an economical and efficient antenna tower anti-ice practice and configuration that will mitigate the icing and freezing rain shorting effects to the Coast Guard’s DGPS transmitted signal, that is equivalent to or better than the sole practice of using synthetically rubberized ribbed insulators connected to most DGPS(V)1 TLE antenna cables.  
1.2	Personnel.
1.2.1	Citizenship: All contractor employees used on this contract shall be citizens of the United States, or if aliens, shall be legal residents of the United States
1.2.2	Employee Identification: In the event a contractor employee is working on-site at any government facility, appropriate identification shall be provided in accordance with government security procedures. 
1.2.3	Employee Conduct: The contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all applicable local and higher regulations, policies and procedures, e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, security, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of firearms.  The contractor shall ensure that all its employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States (US), the Department Of Homeland Security (DHS), or the USCG. 
1.2.3.1	Removing Employees from Installation for Misconduct or Security: In the event a contractor employee is working at a government site, the Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the contractor to remove any employee from the installation for misconduct or security reasons.  Such removal does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide sufficient qualified personnel required for adequate and timely services.
1.2.4	Conflict of Interest: The contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to, cause a conflict of interest.  The contractor shall not employ on a part or full time basis an employee of the USCG, uniformed or civilian, unless the USCG has officially approved that employment.
1.2.5	Program Manager: The Contractor shall designate a Program Manager (PM) as a single point of contact for all technical matters on the contract.  The name of this person shall be submitted within 10 business days of contract award.  This individual will be designated as key personnel in the performance of work under this contract.  During any absence of the PM, only one alternate shall serve as the government contact point.  The PM, and any designated alternate(s), shall have full authority to act for the Contractor on all contract matters of this contract.  The PM and all designated alternates shall be able to read, write, speak and understand English, fluently. 
1.3	Government Quality Assurance: The government will evaluate the contractor’s performance under this contract using the task requirements and quality standards in this performance work statement.  The contractor’s performance will be evaluated by a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).
1.4	Security Clearances: No special security clearances are required to perform the work under this contract.

2	SCOPE OF WORK.
2.1	Overview:  The purpose of this SOW is to identify an effective anti-icing material, product, configuration, or system that when installed on DGPS site antenna towers will consistently and significantly mitigate, reduce, or eliminate the adverse and detrimental shorting effect ice creates, especially when ice forms over smooth antenna cable insulators.   This study will identify the best anti-icing method, at the most advantageously economical cost to the government.  Multiple recommendations shall be provided to the government each with an accompanying cost-benefit analysis and anti-ice effect expectation. 
2.2	Technical Changes:  None.
2.3	Documentation
2.3.1	Style and Format:  The contractor shall provide two paper copies, and one electronic copy of all documents, study analysis, and recommendations as required here-in.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-27.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested offerors may submit a quote.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Building Fire & Research Laboratory (BFRL), has a requirement for a Thermal Desorber System, including installation and training.  A new gas chromatograph (GC) with a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) was purchased in 2004 to perform future indoor air quality research studies in the field and in a laboratory test chamber for BFRLâ€™s Indoor Air Quality Group.  The GC-MSD is a highly sensitive and accurate piece of equipment requiring an equally sensitive and accurate thermal desorber, air sampling and sample introduction system, to capture, concentrate, and transfer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from air samples to the GC-MSD without compromising sample integrity.

All interested quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items:  

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Thermal Desorber System meeting all of the following required specifications:
(1)	The system must offer rapid heating, greater than 60degrees C per second, of the focusing trap. This is critical, particularly during the initial stages of secondary (trap) desorption;
(2)	Backflush desorption of the focusing trap must be available in all configurations (tube desorption or on-line) to allow multi-sorbent trapping and quantitative retention/desorption of the widest possible volatility range of analytes;
(3)	The focusing trap must feature a narrow I.D (less than 1 mm) at the inlet and outlet end to the cold trap. The desorber must be compatible with industry standard 3.5-inch (89 mm) x Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) O.D. tubes for compliance with standard methods such as; ASTM D-6196-03, ISO 16017, ISO/DIS 16000-6, prEN 14662, US EPA Method TO-17, NIOSH 2549 and the UK MDHS series. The tubes must also be compatible with standard long-term storage caps and be designed for compatibility with axial diffusive sampling as per standard methods (ISO 16017-2, prEN 14662 and ASTM D6196-03);
(4)	 As required by relevant standard methods, the analytical sequence must include an ambient temperature, â€œno-flowâ€ leak test of each tube prior to analysis, without stopping the carrier gas to the GC column and detector, to ensure data integrity;
(5)	After desorption, the desorber must allow the cooling sample tube to be isolated from the flow path. At no stage during sample analysis can the sample flow path be opened to the atmosphere;
(6)	It should be possible to split both during sample tube and focusing trap desorption to obtain overall split ratios in excess of 1000:1 for compatibility with both trace level contaminants and high concentration VOCs;
(7)	The system must be able to quantitatively re-collect the split effluent for repeat analysis, data validation, method validation and sample archiving in compliance with ASTM D6196-03. This feature must be fully integrated into the desorber as a standard function with attention to crucial details such as: a) the sample flow path to the split re-collection point must be heated and inert, b) there must be easy access to the split re-collection tube, c) it must be possible to automate the split re-collection facility, d) the software must allow carrier gas to be isolated from the split line such that access to the split line/re-collection point does not cause a large, temporary leak of carrier gas, e) there must be only one common sample re-collection point for all splits such that all the sample which is not analyzed during the primary run, is re-collected;
(8)	The desorber must offer electronic mass flow control of the split for enhanced method reset-ability, selection of different split flows for the various stages of desorption and automatic sequencing of desorption methods with different inlet split flows and different outlet split flows;
(9)	The system must feature the option of back pressure regulated electronic pneumatic control of the carrier gas flowing to the GC column at all stages of thermal desorber operation. This should stabilize retention times, facilitate pressure/flow programming and enable retention time locking plus the associated creation of Retention Time libraries;


LINE ITEM 0002:  Quantity (1) each Autosampler meeting all of the following required specifications:
(1)	The instrument must NOT require that the sample end caps be removed or replaced during analysis;
(2)	Every tube must be subjected to a flow leak test at ambient temperature before desorption. The system must not allow sample analysis to be performed if any leak is detected. Failed tubes must be left intact and recorded in system memory for user intervention. After a tube has failed the leak test, the system must continue to test subsequent tubes;
(3)	If a tube fails the leak test during an automatic sequence, a GC run should be initiated to keep the desorber sequence in sync with the GC/MS. The system should stop if an error requiring user intervention occurs;
(4)	The automated desorber must have the ability to automatically add internal gas standards to each sorbent tube.  The standards must be added in the sampling direction and only occur after leak testing and before any other stage of operation. It would be very beneficial if the system adding internal standards introduced them to the sampling end of blank tubes after leak testing, but without subjecting them to the desorption process. Then, this system could be used to pre-load blank tubes with internal standards before they were sent for field monitoring.
LINE ITEM 0003:  Installation & Training:
The Contractor shall provide installation for all equipment.  Installation shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of all equipment, turn key start-up, and demonstration of specifications.  
	
The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate one (1) eight (8)  hour) training session for three (3) NIST personnel, on-site at NIST Gaithersburg.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, equipment operation and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed on-site at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of specifications. 

Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Delivery and installation should be completed not later than 12 weeks after receipt of the order.
	
Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and Price.  Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.  

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.  

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided.  Evaluation of Past Performance will be based on information obtained from references provided and/or the quoterâ€™s recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or itsâ€™ affiliates.  		

Past Performance and price shall not be evaluated on quotations determined to be technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability evaluation criteria identified above.

The site for the installation is located at 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235 in the parking lot adjacent to the bus loop (Area R).  The contractor shall be required to do the following tasks in conjunction with the installation:  1) Remove old existing Tokheim 785 dispenser and remove off site.  2) Perform demolition of existing concrete pump island and dispenser piping. 3) Uncover existing underground storage tank and remove existing steel piping.  4) Install new E-85 compatible product piping.  5) Backfill piping trench and pour new 3’ x 6’ concrete pump island.  6) Set and plumb new Bennett model #3913 single product hose dispenser.  7) Install new E-85 compatible hose swivel, break-away and nozzle on dispenser.  8) Purge and test product piping.  9) Test operation of new dispenser.  The performance period shall be date of award through 60 days.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number SSA-RFQ-05-1254 and the solicitation are issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-26.  This acquisition is unrestricted as to the size of the business.  The NAICS Code is 238220 and size standard is $12 million.  FAR 52.252-6 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (APR 1984) (a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any federal acquisition regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of “(deviation)” after the date of the clause.  (b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any [insert regulation name] (48 CFR []) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of “(deviation)” after the name of the regulation.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (OCT 2003)--Tailored, applies to this acquisition.  The clause, 52.212-4 is tailored as follows.  Paragraph (t), Central Contract Registration (CCR) is deleted in its entirety.  In lieu of Paragraph (t), contractors shall follow the requirements in the Clause 52.204-7, Central Contract Registration (OCT 2004)-Deviation, which is incorporated in full text as an Addendum/Attachment to this order.

During this transition period, the agency is going to temporarily deviate from the requirement to use the CCR database as its source of information for EFT payments. Therefore, this contract includes the clause at 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999) in lieu of the clause at FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003). This is the only deviation from the requirements of this clause, 52.204-7. The contractor shall comply with all other requirements for CCR registration in the clause. This clause, 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) is revised to reflect this deviation. The revised sections are shaded. (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by (D&B) plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that– (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active.” (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS + 4
number that identifies the offeror’s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS
number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR
database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet
directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number—(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration
when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration
immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial
registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current,
accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and
conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name
or division name, (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, the contractor shall, after all of the requirements in FAR Subpart 42.12
are met and a novation or change-of-name agreement has been properly executed, change its
name, and update its information in the CCR database. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

B.1. SUMMARY
 

USTDA is considering the provision of Technical Assistance (TA) for an analysis of Energy Sector Training Program Activities (“Training Programs”) for the Iraqi oil and gas sector.  The Training Programs will be implemented by USTDA in conjunction with other US Governmental (USG) agencies and the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (Ministry).  USTDA seeks to contract with a US firm (Contractor) to provide USTDA preliminary recommendations concerning the structuring of the potential content, scope and timing of these Training Programs.  The primary purpose of the Training Programs would be to support the Ministry’s efforts to increase the skill levels of energy sector officials and employees working in the Iraqi oil and gas sector.   
 

The Contractor will be required, among other tasks, to provide recommendations to USTDA concerning potential Training Programs in the Iraqi oil and gas sector.  The Contractor shall work with various USG Agencies, the U.S. private and public sectors and the Ministry in developing key preliminary information concerning the proposed Iraqi Training Programs.  The Contractor shall provide specific deliverables to USTDA (and other USG representatives) as set forth in Section C.2 below.  These deliverables will include the submission of written analyses, comparisons, evaluations, recommendations, and other, work products, including a Final Report.  The Final Report will include specific recommendations concerning the content, scope, timing and approximate cost of the Training Programs. 

This Contractor shall provide important evaluation services in connection with the contemplated Training Programs. It is essential that such evaluation be conducted with complete impartiality and objectivity and that the Contractor and its Subcontractors do not obtain an unfair competitive advantage in USTDA-funded activities resulting from this contract. In accordance with the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5 and USTDA policy, the Contractor and its Subcontractors, if any, for this contract shall be ineligible to compete for, as a prime or subcontractor or otherwise, USTDA-funded Ministry Training Program activities that result from this contract unless USTDA, through its Contracts Office, shall have granted a waiver, based upon FAR 9.503, that preclusion of the Contractor or its Subcontractors from the follow-on activity would not be in the Government's interest. This restriction shall remain in effect for three (3) years from the termination of this contract. The Contractor shall include this restriction in all subcontracts.
 
B.2. SERVICES

See Section I of this solicitation/contract for applicability of the contract clauses.  For a period hereinafter set forth, and as more fully described in Section C, the Contractor shall provide expert advice and Technical Assistance to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and other USG representatives as designated by USTDA.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

According to the World Bank, the health status of Afghans is among the worst in the world, with infant mortality rates of 165 per 1,000 births and maternal mortality rates of 1,600 per 100,000 live births.  Communicable diseases such as malaria, measles, and tuberculosis are prevalent and contribute to a life expectancy at birth of only 43 years.  A survey of existing health facilities showed that most Afghans do not have access to basic medical services.  Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide the bulk of health services, with 80% of health facilities operated or supported by NGOs.

In order to address this urgent problem, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) has developed a Basic Package of Health Services, including maternal and newborn health, child health and immunization, public nutrition, and communicable disease control.  The GOA plans to deliver the Basic Package to 90% of the population by 2010.  By contracting with NGOs and private sector providers and increasing funding to government-run service providers, the GOA plans to achieve this goal.  

The World Bank is helping to fund the expansion of healthcare services with $60 million in grant and loan financing.  USAID is also working to improve the healthcare infrastructure by constructing and rehabilitating up to 400 health facilities and to improve vaccination rates through a national immunization program for measles and polio.

The GOA is also looking at a number of other projects to improve the provision of health servcies in Afghanistan.  The Ministry of Public Health of the GOA has requested USTDA-funded feasibility studies on the following healthcare sector projects:
·	Inventory Control Systems
·	Health Facilities Standards and Accreditation
·	Mental Health Delivery and Management
·	Drug Rehabilitation
·	Nutrition
·	Biomedical Engineering and Medical Equipment Maintenance
·	Capacity Building for the Ministry of Public Health Construction Department

The DM consultant would need to travel to Afghanistan in order to properly assess which, if any, of the above projects meet USTDA criteria.  As part of its review process, the DM would contact other U.S. Government agencies, such as USAID, and international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

These Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the Host Country. 

The analysis shall focus on what Development Impact is likely if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.  While specific focus shall be paid to the immediate impact of the project, analysis shall include any additional developmental benefits that may result from the project’s implementation, including spin-off and demonstration effects.

Accordingly, the analysis shall be an assessment of each of the following categories with respect to the project’s potential Development Impact:

(1)  Infrastructure:  Provide a statement on the infrastructure impact, giving a brief synopsis.  For example, “The project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve ___ [number] additional households in ____ [area].”


(2)  Market- Oriented Reform:  Provide a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

(3)  Human Capacity Building:  Assess the number and type of local positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project, as well as the number of local people who would receive training; describe such potential training program.

 (4)  Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement:  Provide a description of any advanced technologies that would be utilized as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that would be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%”).

(5)  Other:  Describe any other developmental impacts or benefits that would result from the project, for example, follow-on or replication projects, safer workplace, increased good governance or improved financial revenue flows to the Host Country.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The economy of Afghanistan continues to be hampered by the more than two decades of conflict it has endured.  Current GDP per capita, which is estimated at $700 (on a purchasing power parity basis), places Afghanistan among the lowest income countries in the world.  During the troubled times and under the previous regime, higher education was nearly non-existent in Afghanistan and even basic education was curtailed, particularly for girls.  Consequently accounting training was severely lacking in the country.  Without accounting skills at an international standard, implementing projects is difficult and proper financial controls cannot be established.  The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan has highlighted the need for accounting standards training, stating in a speech in September 2004, “the government [of Afghanistan] does not have the requisite level of accounting skills to optimally manage its revenue and expenditure responsibilities, as government accountants are not trained in modern accounting practices.”  

Rebuilding Afghanistan will continue to require serious economic reform.  In the public sector there is a need to strengthen institutions and establish procedures that will encourage transparency and good governance.  In the private sector there is a need to establish an environment that will allow investment, trade, and entrepreneurship to flourish.  Accounting, which should provide reliable, transparent, and understandable financial information, is an essential element for all of these areas of reform.

Afghanistan has been isolated from international developments in the accounting field for over twenty years.  One of the major developments Afghanistan has missed has been the promulgation of IAS by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  The IASB, an independent, privately funded accounting standards center, has been developing the IAS as a set of global standards to encourage transparent and comparable information in financial statements.  By harmonizing local accounting standards, standardizing financial operations, and introducing new requirements for the reporting of information, the adoption of IAS in Afghanistan would increase the capacity of both foreign and domestic parties to understand the financial operations of businesses.  This would encourage investment, promote good governance, and play an essential role in management of multilateral-funded government programs. 

The DM consultant will need to travel to Afghanistan in order to properly assess the training needs of Afghan accountants, determine whether the training meets USTDA criteria and write Terms of Reference and budgets for the training.  The DM Consultant will determine whether any assistance would be in IAS or GAAP or both accounting systems, as appropriate.  As part of its review process, the DM contractor will contact other U.S. Government agencies, such as USAID, and international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

USTDA funded an International Accounting Standards Training for Iraq in FY2004.  It is anticipated that the DM will recommend similar assistance (IAS or GAAP).
 
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

We are proposing to team/partner with a large sub to bid this solicitation.  We, as a company, do not possess permits from either the PUC or FHWA but our partner/sub does.  Does this preclude us from being able to successfully bid this  solicitation? Answer:  Often, the analysis of the requirements of the RFP by the proposal manager and proposal team members will indicate that the company lacks the capability to provide effectively one or more elements or components of a complete product or system requ ired by the solicitation. In this situation, it is often desirable to involve in the proposal preparation effort another company that is better qualified to provide the capability that may be lacking. This job can be accomplished by a teaming arrangement. The government recognizes the validity and legitimacy of teaming arrangements, albeit with certain limitations.  The government requires its prime contractor to disclose the existence and composition of any teaming arrangement formed to perform a contract,  so that it may exercise its authority to withhold its consent to a particular subcontract arrangement. The government, for example, would not recognize a teaming arrangement involving a debarred or suspended teaming partner.  In addition, the government r etains the authority to determine that its prime contractor is responsible, that is, it has the financial, industrial, and other resources necessary to perform the contract and is an ethical contractor. The government also has the ability to ensure that it  can obtain necessary data rights, pursue policies on competitive contracting, and hold the prime contractor fully responsible for contract performance. This may include evaluation of subcontractor's responsibility as well. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         QUANTITIES ESTIMATED QUANTITIES The quantities shown by area of performance for each item in this solicitation are the Governments estimates of requirements, which may be ordered during the period of the contract. The Governments estimated maximum daily requirements, excluding Saturday , Sunday, National, State and local holidays are listed below by area of performance within each schedule.  *Prospective contractors must complete the Prospective Contractor's Guaranteed Daily Capability, which must equal or exceed the Governments minim um acceptable daily capability, for all items within an area of performance for which they submit bids.  Failure to do so will render the quote non-responsive. 	Government's Est.
