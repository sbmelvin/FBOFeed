<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) intends to award a sole source, fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Q-Sense, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of the acquisition is to purchase one complete Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation monitoring and data acquisition and analysis hardware and software, QCM D300 system plus a box of 5 silicon dioxide coated crystals and 5 polystyrene coated crystals.  QCM technology has played an important role in measuring thin film deposition on surfaces in manufacturing and interfacial chemistry research and is now beginning to be applied to environmental processes studies.  This instrument will be used to explore the basic phenomena governing colloidal (natural colloidal materials and man-made nanomaterials) interactions with model soil and sediment surfaces (ex. QCM silicon dioxide and polystyrene coated crystals).  A better understanding of these interactions will improve the ability to model the fate and transport of colloids and nanomaterials in the environment. The system shall:  (1) have nanogram per cm2 sensitivity for liquid applications; (2) be fully integrated with on board temp control (+ 0.02oC) and liquid flow-through chamber; (3) come complete with a data station consisting of a current computer and a minimum flat screen of 19?; (4) include all accessories for crystal handling, changing, and cleaning; (5) include hardware and software capabilities for dissipation analysis of elastic films (at least 10-7 delta D in liquid); and (6) accept a wide range of coated crystals to be used as models for a range of environmental surfaces.  Software shall include a complete set of tools for acquiring and analyzing output data and for plotting layer mass, thickness, and elasticity over time.  Software and hardware must be Section 508 compliant.  Equipment is required by 07.31.07.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 339111.  It has been determined that Q-Sense is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  No solicitation or request for quote (RFQ) is available.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA?s requirements as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing by email to Rick Pittman.  A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Rick Pittman via email at pittman.rick@epa.gov.

<DESC>This solicitation is being issued as a result of The General Services Administrations completion an Administrative Support Function (ASF) competitive sourcing study under OMBs Circular A-76 for the Public Buildings Service work performed in the Central Office.    Competitive Sourcing, or the OMB A-76 review process, is part of the Presidents Management Agenda.   The process allows an agency to develop a proposal known as the Most Efficient Organization (MEO), which is compared against a theoretical cost of contractor performance known as the Estimated Contract Price.  The result of this competition will allow us to manage administrative support activities more effectively, as well as ensure that the government and taxpayer alike are getting the most for their money.

The Requirement Document (RD) for this study identified 29 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions whose work was captured in the RD.  Of the 29 positions, 11 were government and 18 were contractors.

On September 8, 2006 it was announced that the Agency Provider Most Efficient Organization (MEO) was the performance decision.

This solicitation is un-restricted, and is to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811310 and the size standard is $6.5 million dollars.  See explanation of size standards at the following website: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.  This procurement includes Option periods.  The performance period will include a 12-month base period, and nine 12-month option periods,  for a total maximum duration not to exceed 120 months.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and price (Factor 6).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are approximately equal to price, Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal?s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  The evaluation factors are set forth below:
Factor 1: Experience
Factor 2: Past Performance
Factor 3: Key Personnel
Factor 4: Equipment & Inventory
Factor 5: Safety
Factor 6: Price
Offeror shall submit its proposal in two (2) separate parts as follows:

1) Technical Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.

2) Price Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Include all other Price Proposal submission requirements shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation.  Price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder from the technical proposal, and clearly marked ?Price Proposal?.  Offerors shall complete Exhibits A through K.  Option Period 1 through 9.  OFFERORS SHALL COMPLETE ALL EXHIBIT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (ELINS) UNIT PRICES AND TOTAL AMOUNTS IN THE BASE YEAR AND FOR EACH OPTION PERIOD.    

While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with RFP Factor 6, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any required cost-technical trade-off analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government: 

Base Year: 
FFP (ELINs A001 through A027)
IDIQ (ELINs A050 through A055)
Option 1:
FFP  (ELINs B001 through B027)
IDIQ (ELINs B050 through B055)
Option 2:
FFP  (ELINs C001 through C027)
IDIQ (ELINs C050 through C055)
Option 3:
FFP  (ELINs D001 through D027)
IDIQ (ELINs D050 through D055)
Option 4:
FFP (ELINs E001 through E027)
IDIQ (ELINs E050 through E055)
Option 5:
FFP  (ELINs F001 through F027)
IDIQ (ELINs F050 through F055)
Option 6:
FFP  (ELINs G001 through G027)
IDIQ (ELINs G050 through G055)
Option 7:
FFP (ELINs H001 through H027)
IDIQ (ELINs H050 through H055)
Option 8:

IDIQ (ELINs J050 through J055)
Option 9:
FFP  (ELINs K001 through K027)
IDIQ (ELINs K050 through K055)

In the event there is a difference between a unit price and the extended total amount, the unit price will be held to be the intended price and the total of the ELINs will be recomputed accordingly.  If the offeror provides a total amount for an ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the ELIN will be held to be the intended price.

<DESC>NOTICE: ONLY ITS BPA HOLDERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO RESPOND TO THIS SOLICITATION:  Request for Proposal (RFP) for Control Number 07-ELSG-ES-0001.  HQ ELSG/ESO has a Logical follow-on requirement under the ITS BPA Program for technical and management support for the Interim Work Information Systems (IWIMS)/Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES).   The Performance Work Statement, with a period of performance beginning 01 May 2007 through 30 April 2008, is attached.  A Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition has been approved and is also attached.  The anticipated labor-task order is a logical follow-on to Task Order FA8771-05-F-8003, awarded against GSA contract Number GS-35F-5440H and ITS BPA F01620-02-A-0001.  The incumbent contractor is CenTech Group, Inc.  It is the Government's intention to award this logical follow-on to CenTech Group, Inc., a small business, for the period of performance 01 May 2007 through 30 April 2007.   Other responses should reflect your ability to fulfill the requirements of the tasks relative to the criteria in the Performance Work Statement and should be received no later than 12:00, Noon, on 27 April 2007.   Your adherence to this time schedule is important so that the project can be awarded to accommodate the customers' requirements.   Please submit all questions related to this synopsis electronically to Contract Specialists:  mary.peters@gunter.af.mil. The following are portions of information taken from the Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition to support this sole source logical follow-on:  II.  Description of Action This individual Justification and Approval is for a logical follow-on award to General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) GS-35F-5440H, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) F01620-02-A-0001, Task Order (TO) FA8771-05-8003. The TO will be a negotiated labor-hour contract with a period of performance of one year utilizing labor categories contained within the aforementioned GSA contract that has an expiration date of 07 April 2008.  V.  Applicability of Authority The regulatory guidance is being used to justify the issuance of a one year logical follow-on to Task Order FA8771-05-F-8003 is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(b)(2) to support maintenance releases already in progress under the current period of performance.   The logical follow-on of this contract is essential to the development and fielding of ACES release of the Common Access Card (CAC)/Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) sign-on capability, which started in March 2006, as well as the continuing development of Real property Inventory Requirements (RIPR) (per Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD) DoDI 4165.14) for HQ 754 ELSG/ILI's customers with a completion date of late September 2007.  The CAC/PKI release is estimated to be an eight month effort and will correct a security vulnerability that was identified during the certification and accreditation process and annotated in the Certificate of Networthiness conditional approval. The RIPR development is an on going OSD initiative to improve the integration of financial management and business operations.  DOD is working to advance the reliability, accuracy, and timeliness of its real property information environment and inventory reporting systems.  In short, ACES currently does not meet DOD's current and forecasted requirements.  It would be detrimental at this point to change contractors in the middle of these efforts.  The award of the logical follow-on is critical to the ongoing work being performed by the contractor.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The MKS configuration management software serves as the toolset to manage the automated processes, the configurable items (CIs) and the metrics captured necessary for audit ability, traceability and an adherence to the standards of a full software development life cycle (SDLC) and will be instrumental in current project success and ease of future project planning and implementation.   This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1. The MKS software provided a level of administrative ease that the other products did not offer.  MKS was less labor intensive and easier to implement due to the user friendly administrative functionality of the tool.  Other tools required additional hardware and dedicated administrative personnel.  This requirement will be published in FedBiz.Opps indicating the U. S. Department of States intent to procure on a sole source basis for the services. HR/EX conducted an initial market survey analysis of 11 CM software tools and seven vendors were asked to provide further information about their products.  After extensive evaluation and testing, the MKS Integrity Suite 2005 software was shown to meet all HR/EX requirements.  MKS is proprietary software and is only available through a MKS Software, Inc. A market survey of 11 CM software tools was conducted.  Of these, seven were found to be possible providers for a solution that provided the level of CM required to meet HR/EX business needs. Only MKS was found to meet the requirements for our specific development platforms and deliver the required CM functionality necessary to capture the required metrics.  MKS will provide the services required reasonably, efficiently and cost effectively.<BR><BR>

In light of the short time frame, it is not required that vendors indicate which two individuals will attend unless those individuals haven't yet been identified to FAA.  Please also note that all representatives from vendors must sign-in.  As the due date for responding to the sources sought announcement has passed, no further letters/emails of intent to attend Industry Day 1 will be accepted.  *** ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT:  BACKGROUND: See the "Tower Simulation System - Sources Sought" announcement posted 4/12/07 and last revised 4/18/07 for information regarding this requirement and Industry Day 1.

Sign-In: Upon entering the conference room a representative from each vendor will be asked to sign an attendance sheet.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of these services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractors facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractors Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractors Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractors Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractors  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008).

<DESC>This synopsis for this procurement action is being amended to add the following comments: Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to exclude all  automotive manufacturers, nonroad vehicle and engine manufacturers, fuel refineries and distributors, and air emissions testing equipment manufacturers and dealers that may be affected by the policies or regulations for which the contractor has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide support under this contract.  Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual organizational conflicts of interest can be mitigated, avoided or neutralized. The solicitation will contain the following provision, ?Industries Prohibited from Being Considered for Award?.  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	?Contractor support is required in the area of testing support for various engines, fuels and vehicles.  The contractor will be required to perform testing, statistical, and technical services to support the development of regulatory and non-regulatory programs.  The contractor will also be involved in performing analyses to provide the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ)with sound scientific and business research to determine the effectiveness and potential benefits of current and proposed air quality improvement programs.  The contractor that provides such support must be free from actual organizational conflicts of interest in order to ensure the integrity of the rule-making process.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought posting for market research purposes only. This is not a request for Quote. The Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA is seeking vendors capable of providing an AIRBORNE SEPARATION VIDEO (ASV) REMOTE SENSOR CAMERA SYSTEM for Edwards Air Force Base, California;

AIRBORNE SEPARATION VIDEO (ASV) REMOTE SENSOR CAMERA SYSTEM Salient Characteristics:

The ASV Remote Sensor (RS) Camera System is a digital high-speed airborne camera system. The RS Camera will capture high-speed images up to 500 Frames Per Second (FPS) at full image resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels The system meets the extreme environmental requirements of the airborne operation on high performance aircrafts;

The Remote Sensor format provides a camera with a small head cross section, which allows the camera head to be mounted in areas that are too small for the standard Long-Term Test Capability (LTTC) camera.  The electronics for the camera are located in a larger section, electrically connected to the head. The camera is divided into two sections, a Remote Sensor Head (RSH) section and a Remote Sensor Body (RSB) section. These two sections communicate via a fiber optic link. The characteristics of the fiber optic link allow these two sections to be located up to 100 meters (328 ft) apart. The system uses an external computer for initial setup and for external storage of images.  The RS Body section is a modular design consisting of one to four Channel Modules. Each Channel Module can control up to two RS Heads. The RS Body can control from one to eight RS Heads;

The RS Body has a removable 24Gbyte Solid State Drive (SSD). The drive is used for non-volatile storage of captured images from the camera. The drive can be accessed using the RS Body, 10/100/1000 Ethernet port, or by removing the drive and plugging it into the USB port of a Windows based PC using Windows Explorer;

The RS Body can be used in three different configurations:
a)	The RSB can be controlled from an ASVS MSC;
b)	The RSB can be controlled from an ASVS CCU;
c)	The RSB can be a complete system with no external control. In this configuration the RSB will control and monitor its own operation; 

The Ground Support Unit (GSU) is an external computer used for setup and control of the RS Body. The GSU consist of a ?Lunch Box? style computer with two additional PCI cards. These card provide:
 
a)	Control of a camera for test on the Ground;
b)	RS170 Monitor for display on the ground of RS170 data from the RS Body;

The GSU provides for external storage of image data from the RS Body, via connection to the 10/100/1000 MB Ethernet port. The data can also be stored on DVD disk;

The RS Camera Head utilizes a 1280 x 1024 pixel CMOS sensor, capable of up to 500 frames per second operation at full resolution. Higher speeds are available by reducing the images resolution; e.g. 512 x 512 pixels at 1000 frames per second.  The only other connection required for the Remote Sensor Camera Head is power;

FOB: Destination Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing genotyping for the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, NIDDK.  These examinations include testing for diabetes and its complications. DNA has been collected from peripheral blood samples in most participants in the last 20 years. Previous analyses of family data, including a genome-wide linkage study, indicate a strong familial aggregation of diabetes in this community and the presumptive chromosomal locations of one or more diabetes-?susceptibility genes. Current technology now allows for much denser mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire genome than has been possible previously. Scope of work is to Genotype DNA samples, to be provided by NIH from approximately 975 participants in the Gila River Indian Community study. Genotyping should include approximately one million SNPs covering the entire human genome. Data will be provided to NlH in a computer-readable format.  The NIH will provide samples of DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or cultured cells from study participants. All respondents are requested to identify their firm?s size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government?s requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than 15 days prior to close of business (5:00 P.M. local time at designated location) on May 7, 2007. Responses by fax or e-mail WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. A.  Request Summary The Government is seeking information regarding lightweight, low-cost technologies and techniques to provide safe entry and either low-g ("soft") or high-g ("hard") landing for these payloads. For purposes of this RFI, "soft" landing is defined as Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) loads that are less than the launch loads, and "hard" landing is considered EDL loads higher or significantly higher than launch loads (e.g., impactors or penetrators).  In all cases, onboard instrumentation is expected to survive landing for operations for up to several Earth years on the Martian surface.  In accordance with 15.201 (e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. B.	Background  The Mars Exploration Program (MEP http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov   ) is a science-driven effort to characterize and understand Mars as a dynamic system, including its present and past environment, climate cycles, geology, and biological potential. The MEP further embraces the challenges associated with the development of a predictive capability for Martian climate and how the role of water, obliquity variations, and other factors may have influenced the environmental history of Mars. The foundation of the scientific strategy for the MEP is also referred to as "follow the water." This strategy connects fundamental program goals pertaining to biological potential, climate, the evolution of the solid planet, and the development of knowledge and technologies applicable to the eventual exploration of Mars by humans.  The program builds upon the scientific and technical heritage of the early Mariner and Viking missions to Mars, and later Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor. The Program's five current missions are Mars Odyssey, twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Phoenix, and the Mars Science Laboratory. The Program plans to continue flying missions to Mars at every 26-month launch opportunity. The next decade in NASA's exploration of Mars consists of a series of missions to improve our understanding of Mars' habitability; climate; geophysical characteristics and history; and its potential harboring of life, past or present.	The 2011 opportunity is an already-competed Scout mission addressing aeronomy through one of two currently proposed mission concepts. The Mars Science Orbiter (MSO) in 2013 will continue the successful program strategy of Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, by pursuing compelling science and technology while also providing essential telecommunication relay infrastructure for future landed missions. Also in the next decade are potential missions that could include a network of small landers and/or related technology demonstrations, to further the understanding of the Mars interior and climate systems.  These could include multiple landed packages carrying meteorological, climatic, and geophysical measurement payloads operating simultaneously on the surface over a decade or more. Climate objectives would include understanding the mechanisms responsible for surface-atmosphere exchange of heat, momentum, dust, water, and other trace gases. Geophysical instrumentation might include seismic sensors, heat flow probes and the capability for making high-precision geodetic measurements. C.	Description of Anticipated Requirement  The following is the Government's (Mars Exploration Program's) current anticipated requirement:  The Government is considering including small, landed instrument(s) or instrument suites as deployed payloads from MSO and/or as a separate network mission. The landers are envisioned to be smaller than 100 kg with the ability to address the science priorities described above. They may be technology demonstrations or operational missions and may be deployed individually, over a series of missions, or as a suite in a single mission.  Payloads on these landers could include meteorological, climatic, or geophysical measurement instruments.   Through this RFI, the Government desires to improve its understanding of the state-of-technology and technology maturity (Technology Readiness Levels, TRLs) for lightweight, low-cost technologies and techniques that will provide safe entry and either low-g or high-g landing on the Martian surface. Information gathered through this RFI could directly affect acquisition strategies developed for early- to mid-next decade Mars missions.  If determined advantageous, the Government could initiate acquisition of landing technologies and techniques as soon as early 2008. D.	Information Requested  NASA invites potential responders to submit feedback on the stated requirements by 4:00 PM EDT on May 31, 2007.  Information on Respondent's Capabilities Requested:  Provide a capabilities and qualifications statement that addresses your ability to provide the specialized technology requirements for Mars EDL and surface landing, including:  * A discussion of the respondent's applicable landing technologies, including mass (per mass delivered if relevant), consumables, etc. A description of previous uses of these technologies, if they are already operational or nearly operational, should be included. A discussion of how they can be applied to the Martian entry, descent, and landing should be included to demonstrate their applicability; * A discussion of maturity level of the respondent's technologies in terms of TRL, with supporting evidence for the claimed TRL. An estimate of investments to-date; a rough-order-of-magnitude cost to bring the system/technology to flight status (TRL 6/7); and a rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimate for development, fabrication, and testing of a flight model; should be included. A cost range is acceptable.  * A description of payload accommodations, such as g-load on landing, sustained forces, other loads during entry and descent, and the payload thermal environment throughout EDL. Describe any unique or enhanced features such as orientation on landing, multiple payload delivery, or any other options enabled by your technology.  * A discussion of your past experience and capability in designing, developing, and delivering similar technologies for planetary missions. This statement should be no more than 5 pages (8.5" x 11" format) in length. Potential respondents who wish to discuss more than one technology should submit separate capabilities statements for each. NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  In addition to the 5-page capability statement, responses should also include 1 page with the following:	name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; potential and required partnerships related to the described technologies and/or systems; and a list of customers covering the past five years (highlight directly relevant work performed and provide point of contact's- address, email, and phone number).	  NASA does not require proprietary information; however, if the respondent submits proprietary material it must be clearly marked with a protective legend. The Government will safeguard the confidentiality of any material marked as "Proprietary". Classified material may also be submitted with appropriate markings and prior arrangements, made by contacting the NASA MEP Point of Contact listed below.	Classified responses must be accompanied by an unclassified abstract. The NASA MEP will evaluate the information from this technology survey for applicability to future missions and acquisitions. The Mars Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which reports to and manages implementation of the Program on behalf of the MEP at NASA HQ, will participate in the assessment of responses to this RFI. Anyone reviewing/assessing responses will sign a non-disclosure agreement and will be firewalled from future proposal efforts in response to relevant solicitations that may result from this RFI.   Depending on the response, MEP is considering a one-day workshop for responders to present and discuss their submissions both in an open forum and, potentially, in a confidential setting.  E.	Summary of Key Information Page limit for the central capabilities statement: 5 pp Submission medium: CD containing statement in searchable PDF format. No hard copy is required.  Number of copies required: 15 copies of each CD are required. One technology statement per CD.

Description
In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), this is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of response to this Sources Sought announcement. All responsible sources may respond, in the form of a capability statement, to this sources sought notice. All such responses will be considered.  
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (with Capabilities Requirement)
1.0	Background:  The LVCAR study is sponsored by the Modeling and Simulation Steering Committee (M&S SC).  The study will explore and assess simulation interoperability alternatives across three broad areas of concern:  notional definition of the desired future architecture standard(s), the desired business model(s), and the manner in which standards should be evolved and compliance evaluated.  The roadmap will provide rationale for these recommendations, assess user community reception of any proposed LVC architecture policy changes, and recommend next steps (e.g., prototyping any new architecture).

2.0	Description of Request:  This Sources Sought Request is to inform and determine availability of potential sources capable of participating as members of and providing relevant market information to the LVCAR Working Group (WG).  The success of the LVCAR study depends on the precision, robustness, and clarity of stated LVC requirements and a representative ensemble of use cases.  To achieve this, participation from the COCOMs, Services, Agencies and other Communities of Interest, to include industry, in a WG chaired by USJFCOM J7, is desired.  

2.1 WG Members Roles and Responsibilities:  The WG interfaces with the LVCAR study in two ways:  

a.	Provides input in support of the development of products
b.	Reviews and provide feedback on theses products, and subsequent findings and recommendations

Thus, the WG should be comprised of representatives that can support both of these functions.  Specifically, WG members should have knowledge of and access to their respective LVC user communities, and they should have sufficient technical expertise to judge the subsequent findings as well as the necessary influence to represent their constituency?s response to those findings.  Given that the LVCAR study focuses on three dimensions of LVC interoperability issues (i.e., architecture, business model, standards development processes), the WG members should be able to collect information (e.g., requirements, use case information, etc.) and represent their constituency across all these dimensions.  Tasks executed by the WG members will include information collection and distribution, attendance at meetings, facilitating communication among the study support team and WG member?s constituency, product reviews, soliciting and providing feedback, etc.  It is anticipated that some constituencies will have multiple representatives assigned to the WG.

2.2 Level of Effort (LOE) and Travel Requirements:  For the WG members it is anticipated that no more than a 10% LOE, based on every other month to quarterly WG meetings over a 15 month period, is required to sufficiently support this project.  The first WG meeting is mid-Jul 2007.  Members should also anticipate periodic teleconferences for status updates.  Any indirect level of effort required for data collection and formal staffing within a constituency is better estimated by the individual constituency.  Embedded in the direct WG membership LOE estimate is the assumption that the WG member?s respective constituent community will respond to requests for information and product review.  Members can anticipate no more than two travel days per quarter over the projected 15 month study period.  WG meetings will be in Northern Virginia, Suffolk, and Orlando.  The LVCAR study is not funded to reimburse WG members for their time and travel associated with this effort.
2.3 Capability Statement:  An interested party?s capability statement must demonstrate requisite experience with LVC architectures and an ability to participate as a WG member or as an information provider to the WG.   Responses/capability statements provided as a result of this notice shall be evaluated by the study managers and approved by the sponsor.  The following information should be included:  
a.	A summary of the party?s relevant current and prior work
b.	An assigned point-of-contact (name, address, phone number, email address) to respond to further information requests on behalf of the M&S SC.
c.	An indication of interest to become a member of the LVCAR WG or an interest in providing information / support to the LVCAR WG on an as requested basis.
d.	A one page corporate summary, including the interested party?s web site.

3.0 Data Rights:  All products (documentation, reports, etc.) and technical data developed and compiled for the LVCAR study shall become the property of the Government with unlimited Government use rights in the absence of any assertion of restrictive rights.  The WG team members shall be required to sign non-disclosure statements, to ensure integrity of sensitive information and findings.  Recommendations and findings from the study will be For Official Government Use Only (FOUO) and shall not be divulged prior to official release by the Government.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought/RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a Request For Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

<DESC>Sources Sought. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services for the Baseline Characterization of the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetland Fish Communities, for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Miami, Florida. Tasks to be performed include, but are not limited to: 1. Kickoff meeting to discuss project components, data requirements, fieldwork logistics, deliverables, and deadlines; 2. Workplan Development; 3. Baseline Data/Historical Review involving a compilation and review of all baseline and historical data relevant to the project; 4. Analyses and reporting of data; 5. Data Collection and Analysis; and 6. Quarterly, Annual and Final Reports. The proposed acquisition is for a base period from the date of a contract award, through 11/30/2007 and two, twelve-month option periods. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 235(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The only known source is Dr. Jerome Lorenz at the Tavernier Science Center of the National Audubon Society, in Florida. Dr. Lorenz is the recognized expert in coastal wetland fish communities in relation to hydrology and salinity, as demonstrated by his publications and previous experience, and is believed to be the only suitable source for the work described. Biscayne Bay coastal wetland habitat is ecologically fragile and easily damaged. NOAA's ability to address essential fish habitat issues and other NOAA mandates will be seriously jeopardized if another vendor is used. It is not cost effective to use another vendor because Dr. Lorenz already has the information, equipment, and materials to do the work and is already experienced in performing these services at the planned sites. Dr. Lorenz has performed several years of work at the same Biscayne Bay sites that will be used in this project. Dr. Lorenz has developed and currently is practicing a unique method of sampling fish communities in the south Florida coastal wetlands. Dr. Lorenz developed this approach as part of his doctoral dissertation and has been applying it for about 18 years in the south Florida coastal wetlands, during which time he has been the sole provider. Dr. Lorenz is presently conducting the same type of work in the coastal wetlands of Florida Bay, Cape Sable, Whitewater Bay, and Shark River Slough under separate funding from another agency. Maintaining the same sampling approach under the same scientific leadership with Dr. Lorenz will ensure that Biscayne Bay results can be related and compared to results in other south Florida coastal wetland ecosystems experiencing past and future effects of water management practices. Consistency in the collection and analysis of the data across years and areas is vital to the success of this project. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a contract to Dr. Jerome Lorenz, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. Responses must include the contractor's name, contact information, and information indicating the contractor's capability to perform the services described herein. Documentation to support the contractor's capability to perform these services must also be submitted which includes the contract number, point of contact and phone number, and a description of services performed under previous contracts for the same services. Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will evaluate each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge and capability to perform these same services. All responses must be in writing and may be sent via email to jacquelyn.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. This action is not set-aside for small business.  All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.

<SUBJECT>58--Joint NBC Reconnaissance System Increment II (JNBCRS 2)- Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>W911SR-07-R-0020
<RESPDATE>073107
<ARCHDATE>09292007

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) has a requirement for a Joint Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Reconnaissance set of missin specific kits that provide the capability to conduct a dismounted reconnaissance mission in a suspected CBRN, Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC), and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) contaminated environment. It shall provide detection, identification, and warning on the presence or absence of contamination. When contamination is found there is a need to sample, collect, and package contaminates for laboratory analysis for confirmatory testing.  CBRN reconnaiss ance teams require a dismounted CBRN equipment package that is light, man portable, and tailorable to be transportable worldwide by rail, sealift and landing craft, or be transportable by aircraft and externally lifted by helicopter.  Additionally, these C BRN teams are required to conduct dismounted CBRN reconnaissance in an austere environment and possess an organic capability to provide personal protection against CBRN hazards.  The CBRN team must be able to conduct operational decontamination.  Future re connaissance capabilities require detection of hazardous materials, the ability to carry out traditional CBRN reconnaissance, and the ability to perform the initial evaluation of a CBRN site assessment (SA).  The CBRN teams require protection from the full  range of CBRN threats in order to conduct their expanded mission.  Reconnaissance units are expected to conduct presumptive identification, analysis, collection and transportation of samples.  Key Performance Parameters required are: 1) Detection and Iden tification of CBRN/TIM hazards in a tactical operational environment.  The probability of detection and identification must have a likelihood of 80%;  2) Deployable in Desert and Tropical regions; and 3) Individual Protection Equipment with a level of prot ection that meets operational mission periods for more than 40 minutes. Reliability factors include: At least 90% probability of completing a 72-hour period without experiencing an Operational Mission Failure.  Maintainability factors include:  90% of all field level maintenance actions to restore loss of mission essential functions must be completed by the operator within 15 minutes. The CBRN set of mission specific kits is designed to be carried on various platforms.  Specific Army Light Brigade Combat te ams may carry the equipment on an M1102 or similar trailer chassis.   Sensors or collective protection are not likely to be integrated into platforms.  This dismountable equipment package will allow light forces to tailor it to provide the capability requi red to Army Light Brigade Combat Teams and support CBRN SA  missions.  In the assessment role, the equipment will be used to detect, identify, collect, and sample potential CBRN materials obtained from buildings, bunkers, caves, ships, containers, and othe r areas that are either inaccessible or impractical to employ a mounted reconnaissance vehicle (NBCRV) or armored reconnaissance system (NBCRS). Due to specialized mission requirements, personnel may be exposed to low oxygen levels, confined space environm ents, and environments with high concentrations of filter penetrating TIMs. The Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) will consist of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), which allows personnel to operate in low oxygen /confined space environments. The JNBCRS 2 program will follow a modified commercially available/Non-Developmental Item acquisition strategy.  JNBCRS 2 will consist of two major components: a modular container with internal storage and the CBRN mission package.  The set of mission spec ific kits will consist of Government and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS and COTS) current available technology.  The hand-held devices will enable the NBC recon naissance team to detect and identify blister and nerve agent vapors in buildings, tunnels, and caves.  The team will have the ability to detect both liquid and vapor concentrations of chemical agents.  A hand-held radiation meter capable of vehicle mounte d or dismounted operations with the ability to detect and measure the gamma dose-rate and gamma and neutron cumulative dose from fallout, radiological contamination, and nuclear detonations and a handheld radiation spectrometer to monitor isotope identific ation and spectrum analysis will be part of the mission package for radiological/nuclear detection, identification and monitoring during dismounted CBRN reconnaissance.  A handheld detection and identification capability is provided for hazardous airborne TIC/TIM contaminants and chemical warfare agents (CWA) to characterize organic and inorganic chemicals and/or chemical families.  A handheld solid and liquid detection and identification capability for the analysis of toxic industrial chemicals, environmen tal contaminants and chemical warfare agents compares the analysis against an onboard database library of known chemicals.  In addition, a portable TIC/TIM identification capability is needed to identify volatile organic compounds, toxic industrial chemica ls (TICs) and chemical warfare agents (CWAs).  A single handheld gas monitor with multiple integrated sensors; capable of monitoring oxygen concentration that automatically warns when oxygen concentration is low and is capable of detecting volatile organic  compounds (VOCs) and warns of a lower explosive limit (LEL). For personal protection during dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, there will be suits with a multi-layer composite chemical barrier laminated to provide protection from toxic particles and water-ba sed liquids.  The complete suit consists of gloves, coveralls, safety glasses, face shield and chemical-resistant steel-toe boots.  Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) certified for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) environments with a pressure regulator, locking quick-connector couplings air supply hose(s) will be available.  A Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) equipped with appropriate gas/vapor cartridge(s) to filter all CBRN contaminants by a lightweight battery-powered generator that provides a constant airflow into the wearers face piece.  This Provides positive pressure airflow facilitating extended wear without adversely affecting user performance and increases time on target during CBRN SA missions. Decontamination capability for dismounted CBRN reconnaissance operations requires an expedient personnel decontamination system.  This is used to decontaminate agents/ hazards to prevent any further absorption and removing secondary contamination threat. A man portable po wer driven decontamination capability that generates an environmentally friendly decontaminant in a vapor form to decontaminate inaccessible and hard to reach locations is included. A lightweight man-portable decontamination system is used to decontaminate  all known chemical warfare agents and also biological agents as well as toxic industrial chemicals that is carried on person and/or mounted inside a vehicle with a decontamination solution.  A portable decontamination shower, which is fully collapsible, h as quick-connects, a durable privacy enclosure and semi-transparent roof.  It has a water storage bag, with associated hoses and drains.  It is transportable and stored in two vinyl bags.  Estimated set-up time is five minutes.  The following sample, marki ng, and collection capabilities will be part of the mission package:  A chemical and biological sampling kit that is capable of collecting samples of powder, liquid, and soil materials.  An antibody-based assay sampling kit is used to presumptively identif y Biological Warfare (BW) agents with a collection capability of identifying ten different BW threat agents with the capability equivalent to or better than HHA  and Department of Defense Biological Sampling Kit.  A handheld meteorological device for collection, use and transferring of meteorological data that monitors (at a minimum) air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and barometric pr essure. A marking capability for CBRN hazards complies with the Standard NATO Agreement (STANAG) 2002.  This kit provides ability to mark a contaminated area and identify clear lanes through a contaminated area. Companies which have the capability to integ rate as well as provide the equipment should respond to this announcement.  Interested companies should provide company name, address, telephone, email contact, and a capabilities statement containing a summary describing their technical capabilities, manu facturing capacity, and information on their past performance on Government contracts.

<DESC>SOLICITATION OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS TO EXHIBIT DURING THE 2007 SUSTAINABLE RANGE PROGRAM (SRP) WORKSHOP (CONFERENCE), 14-17 MAY 2007, HAMPTON, VA. REGISTRATION DEADLINE DUE 1 MAY 2007.  DESC:  Sponsors of the 2007 Sustainable Range Program (SRP) Workshop are seeking commercial firms to exhibit their products and/or services during the four-day 2007 SRP Workshop.  This year, the SRP Workshop will be held at the Hampton Roads Convention Cen ter (HRCC), Hampton, VA, 23666, 1417 May 2007. The Army-wide 2007 SRP Workshop is a combination of the Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Workshop that brought together ITAM program personnel and the Range Symposium that brought together range officers and range operators.   In addition, the Ar my Master Gunners' Conference will be a part of the 2007 SRP Workshop. The Army has adopted an integrated, sustainability-based approach for improving the way in which it designs, manages, and uses its military ranges and training lands to ensure their long-term availability, capability, and accessibility. The Sustainable Range Program (SRP) Workshop is the leading national forum for the scientific exchange of methods, ideas, experiences, and lessons learned that relate to Range Management processes and to the application of Integrated Training Area Manageme nt (ITAM) technologies to the Army's military ranges and training lands.   The Sustainable Range Programs at all U.S. Army installations play a critical role in assuring that military training can be sustained at the highest level for the foreseeable futur e. Training activities have increased, and training budgets continue to expand. Businesses, organizations, companies, and individuals with products and services that relate to land management; land repair and reclamation; wind and soil erosion management; air and water quality issues; forestry and crop land management; GIS program dev elopment and support; road and trail creation and maintenance; environmental and climatological monitoring; unexploded ordnance; and other similar topics will find a ready audience among the SRP Workshop participants. In addition, businesses and organizations with products and services that relate to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of military ranges  from the smallest Combat Pistol Qualification Course to the largest Multi-Purpose Range Complex (M PRC) to specialized training facilities such as those used for Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT)  will have a large audience among those attending the SRP Workshop. There will be approximately 1,100 decision-makers representing government and industry attending the 2007 SRP Workshop.   It provides a unique opportunity to present, explain, and demonstrate commercial products and services that can contribute to sustaini ng military training and training land rehabilitation and maintenance as well as improving range operations. This is the only all-Army event that brings together range officers and operators and the ITAM teams from U.S. Army installations worldwide.  Compared to the costs of visiting individual military installations, the annual SRP Workshop offers a most-effecti ve sales strategy for companies and firms to hold significant face-to-face conversations with these individuals and to actually demonstrate equipment. The 2007 SRP Workshop will focus on improving range operations and environmental programs for sustaining military training lands and maintaining Army readiness.   In addition to the main program of technical presentations at the Workshop, there will be sev eral specialized sessions, including the aforementioned Army Master Gunners' Conference, a Geographic Information System (GIS) Workshop, a Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA) session, and individual Major Army Command (MACOM) meetings. The commercial exhibits will be located in the Exhibit Hall in the Hampton Roads Convention Center (HRCC).  For display and/or demonstration o f equipment, an Indoor Static Equipment Display Area in the Exhibit Hall and an Outdoor Equipment Display Area in the immediately-adjacent parking lot will be provided.   Exhibits will be open Monday through Wednesday of the Workshop, 1416 May 2007.   During the SRP Workshop, the Morning Breaks, the AM Breaks, and the PM Breaks all will be held in the Food Court adjacent to the commercial exhibit area in the HRCC Exhibit Hall.  No program activities or breakout sessions will be scheduled for 30 minutes after each AM or PM Break begins on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Tuesday evening, a free, two-hour Social Hour for all participants will be held adjacent to the commercial exhibits in the HRCC Exhibit Hall. Commercial exhibitors are cordially invited to participate in all open sessions and social events associated with the 2007 SRP Workshop. All commercial exhibit arrangements will be made through the National Institute for Land Management and Training (NILMT) at Kansas State University, the conference support contractor.  To obtain an application to exhibit during the 2007 SRP Workshop or to secure further information, commercial exhibitors may contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2104.  Dr. Biles e-mail address is:  brbiles@ksu.edu.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) Database
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Boston University School of Public Health for the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) Database.  The proposed contract action will be awarded under FAR 13 for a two year performance period, and is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The proposed contractor is Boston University School of Public Health, Maternal & Child Health Department, 715 Albany Street, T5W, and Boston MA, 02118.   In a previous project, the Maternal and Infant Health Branch (MIHB) (Cooperative Agreement U36/CC300860) funded the Maternal Child Health Department, Boston University School of Public Health to work with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to develop the Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) Data System.  PELL is a population-based, longitudinally linked maternal and child data system using vital records, and surveillance and administrative data (including hospital discharge and programmatic data).  Currently, the PELL data system contains approximately 500,000 births and fetal deaths from 1998-2003.  Over 98% of MA birth certificates have been linked to their corresponding maternal or infant hospitalization discharge record. PELL is a unique source of data for research and surveillance on pregnancy outcomes, health care utilization, and ongoing maternal and infant health.  The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to the (PELL) for continuation of this study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received within 15 days of this announcement will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Pitney Bowes, Inc. Stamford, CT 06926-0700.

6 CS/SCBA requires an upgrade to their mail machine, Pitney Bowes DM1000; the following items are required:

- Shape-Based Rating Upgrade Module for DM1000 WOW; Part #: 1FSD, 1 each.


A contract for the new upgrade module will be awarded to Pitney Bowes following no response back to this notice of intent.  The purchase of an upgrade module for the Pitney Bowes DM1000 mail machine must be done through Pitney Bowes because they are the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 6 SC/SCBA currently owns the Pitney Bowes DM1000 mail machine.  Starting on 14 May 07, mail will be measured by size, thickness and dimensions of the packages.  The current mail machine cannot perform these measurements without an upgrade.  However, because of proprietary reasons, no other upgrade module will satisfy this request.  No other company can provide a module that will interface with the DM1000. 

Market research was conducted for the purchase of this Shape-Based Rating Upgrade Module and Pitney Bowes is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 12:00pm on Monday, April 30, 2007, the award for this upgrade module will be made to Pitney Bowes. The POC for this notice is SSgt Joseph P.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 ?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.  
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time consuming litigation.

**LAND MOBILE RADIO (LMR) EQUIPMENT FOR SIX (6) TOWER SITES IN MISSISSIPPI.

===STATEMENT OF WORK, March 2, 2007.

=== I. INTRODUCTION.  ---The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement to assist Federal, State and local emergency management and response agencies with tactical mobile and fixed DISASTER EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS (DEC) capabilities for command and control, situational awareness and other critical missions during emergencies and incidents.  ---Hurricane Katrina destroyed a significant number of first responder communications systems in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.  Outdated and incompatible systems are currently in place to enable basic safety, security and immediate emergency response capability in these areas.  First responders lack adequate radio networks to respond to and manage a catastrophic incident particularly during the evacuation, and search and rescue stages of the event.  
---Mississippi"s three coastal counties and counties that border Southeast Louisiana, where interstate and intrastate evacuation operations are concentrated, currently communicate on dissimilar VHF and 800 MHz radio systems.  Mississippi State agencies operate on a low band VHF system.  Additionally, Louisiana officials communicate on 700 MHz and 700/800 MHz systems that are not interoperable with Mississippi State agencies or County systems.  Interoperability deficiencies and shortcomings can be overcome by the installation of an up-to-date, standards-based 700/800 MHz LMR system in southern Mississippi.  Mississippi Public Safety officials have identified a project, the Mississippi Wireless Integrated Network (MSWIN), to deploy a statewide digital trunked land mobile radio system to coordinate delivery of services to citizens of Mississippi and enable immediate interoperability among public safety resources in routine and emergency situations.  This 700 MHz Public Safety System is intended to provide highly reliable, fast access, private (within groups and individuals) communications to a wide variety of users within the State.  The MSWIN is expected to be deployed over the next 5 years. This acquisition bridges the time gap until the MSWIN project is deployed by deploying tower site infrastructure consistent and compatible with the MSWIN at six (6) tower sites in the southern counties of the State.


===II. PURPOSE.  To bridge the MSWIN time gap and provide MSWIN project communications functionality that will mitigate communications interoperability deficiencies and mission degradation, FEMA plans to purchase six (6) sets of 700 MHz LMR tower site equipment that will be installed at six (6) existing tower sites in southern Mississippi.  The tower sites will be networked using circuits, equipment, systems and facilities provided by the State of Mississippi. This will provide emergency responders with interoperable communications throughout the region during an incident including seamless communications between the Louisiana State Police and Mississippi Highway Patrol and the Transportation Departments of both States.  
***This acquisition will facilitate implementation of the 2006 Gulf Coast Emergency Communication Plan, Mississippi Annex, authorized pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act P.L. 93-288, as amended by P.L. 100-707: Title II Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Assistance, Federal and State Disaster Preparedness Programs, (Sec. 201, and 5185. Emergency Communications, Sec. 418.)  to establish a program of disaster preparedness that utilizes services of all appropriate agencies and includes coordination of Federal, State and local preparedness programs in anticipation of an emergency of major disaster to establish temporary communications systems and to make such communications available to State and local government officials and other persons as appropriate.
***This statement of work (SOW) describes the type of equipment and services required from the supplier to support FEMA efforts to achieve its goals.

===III. SCOPE.  FEMA intends to purchase six (6) sets of 700 MHz, P-25 compliant, Internet Protocol capable Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tower site infrastructure equipment as follows:--Station equipment including repeaters, radios, linear amplifiers, embedded transmitter combiner systems, receiver multi-coupler systems, site trunking controllers, routers and associated software licenses.--Antenna systems including site specific antennas systems based on licensing requirements, transmission lines, transmission line bridges, connectors, surge suppressors, grounding systems, weatherproofing kits, tie down kits, antenna side-arms, and antenna mounting kits.
--Site support systems including racks and mounting equipment, back-up power source, grounding components, etc.---The LMR tower site equipment will be delivered to six (6) tower sites, set up, optimized, and tested.  The specific equipment required at each site will vary somewhat based on the number of repeaters per site, frequency licensing requirements for the respective tower site localities, and pre-existing infrastructure equipment at the designated tower sites.

P.	EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  The Government does reserve the right to make multiple awards.  The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance.  Technical and Management Plan is more important than Past Performance.  When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted. 
Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. 
Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter?s best terms. 
Technical and Management Plan:  The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm.  The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing.  The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan.  The Plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describes contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government.  The technical and management plan shall also include the firms contingency and continuity of operations plans in the event of natural or manmade disasters that may disrupt service capabilities.  
Past Performance:  The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.  Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.  Please include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project;  c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.

Price:  The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for each proposed labor category for the base period and for each option period.  Department of Labor Wage Determination No: 05-2103 is incorporated into this solicitation.  

The technical quote submission shall be limited to 10 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.).  The price proposal has no page limitations.

Q.	SUBMISSION OF QUOTE
All quotes are due no later than 2:00pm, local Washington, D.C. time, May 4, 2007.  Quotes are to be e-mailed to Mr. Bernard Salter, Jr. at Bernard.salter@dhs.gov.  No faxes will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested, a written solicitation will not be issued.
This solicitation is a request for quotations.  This RFQ is issued under simplified acquisition procedures.

This RFQ has one line item.  The item being procured for AFRL/VASV, WPAFB is as follows:

Build and deliver 1 lot of 4 squared HRG 600 VAC Units.  
Brand Name Justification per FAR 6.302-1(c)
Brand Name:  Squared
I.  Use:  The SquareD HRG High resistance ground unit provides means to safely and efficiently apply power to the Next Generation Radiant heat system.  This unit is required for maintaining proper voltage references on a three phase delta source without compromising the integrity or run time of our test operations.
II.  Purpose:  The SquareD HRG unit is an essential fit to the reliability and maintainability required for our testing apparatus.  All known competitors do not provide the reliability that AFRL/VASV requires.
III.  Minimum Requirements:
Research indicates that the major competitors (GE, Cutler Hammer, Siemens) utilize an OEM Kit back plate,supplied by a third party manufacturer, mounted in their own enclosure.  In some cases, the entire device is merely brand labeled.  The decision was made to not pursue this design for the following reasons:
1-The Squared D design uses industrial grade components for the key devices that are required to make this device operate.  The result is a higher initial cost, but a significantly longer life and reduced liability exposure.  These HRGU units are typically used for production equipment where uptime is of the utmost importance and the costs associated with downtime or cleanup/rework due to undetected system problems is significant.  Some examples of significant differences include:
a-Industrial Grade Square D Type X Nema rated relays vs. Commercial Grade Ice Cube Relays and definite purpose contractors for control and pulsing circuits.
b-Industrial Grade Square D Type 9001 pushbuttons in lieu of small commercial grade lights
c-Industrial Grade Square D control power transformers with fused protection in lieu of small "self protected" (throwaway) transformers
d-Nearly all components in our unit are Square D and are therefore easily sourced and replaceable
e-Lockable industrial circuit breaker disconnect with alarm contacts to prevent the device from being removed from service by unauthorized personnel, and also to provide remote indication if turned off or tripped.
f-Designed and manufactured by Square D in West Chester, OH facility which is also a local service facility
g-Freestanding switchgear enclosure to provide durability and protection of the resistor for personnel safety.
This is 100% small business set aside but the non-manfacturing rule is waived, so a Small Business can provide the product of a Large Business Manfacturer.

The size standard for this effort is 500 employees.  NAICS:  335999  FSC:R421  DELIVERY:  On or before 30 June 2007  FOB : Destination  Payment terms:  Net 30 days  Evaluation of Award will be based on overall BEST VALUE to the Government, Technical Capabilities, Price and Past Performance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote; the solicitation number is SP3100-7067-3090.  This solicitation is Unrestricted.
 The Defense Distribution Center, Norfolk, VA (DDNV) has a requirement for Model 3870 Cordless PDF Scanners with DLA firmware, associated cables, and spare batteries as described below (CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002).  
This is a Brand Name requirement due to compatibility and standardization issues; the justification for this Brand Name is as follows:
The personnel using these scanners and cables will be working with the Distribution Standard System (DSS), the current standard distribution system to support the DOD logistics pipeline.  One of the key components to this distribution network is 2D capable scanners that can scan 2D detailed barcodes and forms.  During the last five (5) years, DSS has been transformed into a standardized hardware configuration that includes the Welch Allyn/HHP scanners and associated cables.  Additional software changes have been made to these scanners to accommodate the scanning of print programs.  The cost to the Government to switch to another brand of scanner is estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more), and would require DDC to expend significant resources to rigorously test and validate the new system.  Significant testing of other brands of scanners to function on DLA converted barcodes has not been successful so far.  DDNV requires new scanners and cables that will be compatible with the DSS system.  The Welch Allyn/HHP model 3870 scanner and associated cables is the only model that will meet this compatibility requirement. 
CLIN 0001 is for a quantity of 30 EA HHP Model 3870 Cordless PDF Scanner with DLA firmware, to include scanner, USB Base Station, two (2) cables as described below, and one (1) battery.  The cables are specified as follows: one (1) cable (comes with base station) PS-2 dir conn, 3 feet in length, with 15 pin male connection on base station end and male ps2 connection on other end, part number HHP 3202 Rev b or 42205610-01; one (1) cable (to convert PS-2 to USB) 3 feet in length, with ps2 female connection on one end and USB connection on other end.
CLIN 0002 is for a quantity of 35 EA Spare NiMH Batteries for Model 3870 Cordless PDF Scanner
Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination).  Equipment shall be shipped to the Defense Distribution Depot Norfolk (DDNV), Building W-143 Doorway 17, Receiving Officer, Norfolk, VA 23512-5100.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Equipment and Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Departments core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet. The equipment listed above is required due to the expansion of the ONE program throughout the Department of State.  The firewalls will aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of States mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions submitted by prospective offerors and to add additional information to the minimum requirements stated in the Specifications.  Therefore, effective as of the date of this Amendment: 

1.	The following Questions and Answers are provided:
Question 1:	It is not clear as to what type of microscope platform this is to be on, upright or inverted?

Answer:	The system requirement is for an inverted confocal microscope platform.

Question 2.  	SCAN HEAD - Scan head with fiber connections for both standard and normal detectors.  Due to inefficiency of fiber coupling, we have switched to direct coupling to our detectors.  Is there a reason why fiber coupling will be useful for your needs?

Answer:	No, there is not a reason why fiber coupling is more useful for our needs. The language for this requirement can be changed to:

?Scan head with connections for both standard and normal detectors.? 
(eliminate the word ?fiber?)

2.	The following is added to the Specifications:

1.	Add this to the description on Systems:  ?Illuminator/fiber optic coupling enabling darkfield microscopy for low contrast samples?

2.	Add this to the description on Objectives:  ?Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) APO 100x NA 1.49 oil immersion objective providing high transmittance in the near infrared (NIR) frequency range.?

STATEMENT OF WORK: 1.0 Introduction The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (?EEOC? or ?the Commission?) seeks a quote for a computerized brief bank hosted by the vendor and integrated with one of the Commission?s current Web-based legal research services, Westlaw or LexisNexis. The current Web-based interface would be modified to allow the user to search case law and EEOC briefs together or separately. Access to the EEOC briefs would be restricted to EEOC user accounts. 2.0 Background The Office of General Counsel has approximately 1,000 briefs prepared by its Appellate Division in Word Perfect, Microsoft Word, and Adobe PDF file formats totaling approximately 2 gigabytes. EEOC anticipates the addition of approximately 150 briefs (30 Mb) per year. Some 700 of these briefs are available on the Commission?s internal website, inSite, but have not enjoyed substantial use because of limitations in search capabilities. Under subscriptions maintained by the EEOC Library staff, approximately 700 EEOC employees who will need access to the brief bank currently have access to the online legal research services provided by Westlaw and LexisNexis. In particular, field and headquarters litigators rely on these services for trial preparation work. The Commission views this integrated brief bank as a valuable enhancement to its current subscription-based legal research services. 3.0 Scope The contractor shall provide the facilities, materials, and qualified personnel needed to perform the following required tasks in providing services to fulfill EEOC requirements for hosting, conversion, indexing, integration, and secure housing of existing and new content for a computerized brief bank within an existing Web-based legal research service currently utilized by the Commission: 3.1. Convert and index existing briefs to be included in the EEOC Brief Bank. 3.2. House the knowledge base in a secure environment accessible only to EEOC employee user accounts. a. Access Control. Content should be maintained on a secure server and protected from loss. The vendor?s system must provide access controls such that the content of the briefs should be available only to Commission staff. b. Concurrent User Access. The system must support a minimum of 35 concurrent users accessing the briefs. 3.3. Provide an online facility for receipt of new briefs with access controls to insure origination from the Commission. a. Ongoing Content Delivery. The vendor shall provide an online mechanism for Commission upload of new briefs. The vendor solution should include access controls to insure origination of the content from designated EEOC staff, not to exceed three (3) users. 3.4. Minimally modify contractor?s current user interface to meet EEOC standards required to accommodate the EEOC user?s selection of the body of knowledge to be searched: case law, briefs or both. a. User Interface. The Commission contemplates that modification to the existing user interface should be minimal. These would accommodate the selection of the body of content to be searched (case law or briefs or both) and method for easily distinguishing results. 3.5. At a minimum, provide for searching by date filed, court, attorney, docket number, cases cited, and defendant. In addition, the briefs would be full-text searchable. Topical categorization of the briefs may be proposed by the vendor as a no-cost addition. a. Search Options. The briefs would be indexed and searchable by date filed, court, attorney, docket number, cases cited, and defendant. In addition, the briefs would be full-text searchable. The same Boolean search capability and interface used by legal staff to search case law should be available. Users should be able to search cases and briefs together or separately. Topical categorization of the briefs for indexing and search capability is desirable but not required. b. Search Results. The format of search results should be modified only to distinguish case law from brief results. Upon retrieval, legal citations in a brief should be hyperlinked to the source by document and page. Citations that are no longer good law will be flagged as such. c. Output Options. Provide users with the capability to print or save any brief retrieved in a variety of formats. At a minimum, briefs should be available for download in text-searchable PDF, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, and text. d. Response Time. Response time for brief searches should be comparable to that for case law searches. 3.6. Provide initial training to field legal unit staff and incorporate the brief bank material into the standard, on-going training available to Commission staff. a. The vendor will incorporate into its ongoing training opportunities for the Commission information on use of the brief bank. Initial training will be delivered to field legal unit staff within 30 business days of acceptance. For the purpose of the initial training, the Commission would prefer use of its Web-based training and conference service, Interwise. 4.0 Applicable Documents 4.1. Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM?s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM?s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM?s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word ?mouse? or ?mice? in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.  A printout must be produced for the entire retrieval for each search.  Each citation must be reviewed, and when appropriate, manually annotated to indicate a MeSH heading or headings should be deleted, and/or manually annotated to indicate a specific MeSH heading or headings should be added.  The entire printout of all citations must then be submitted to NLM.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific ?topic? for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new ?topics? for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.

The contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.  The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items.

While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final award decision will be based on Price and Past Performance with Past Performance being more important than Price. For purposes of efficiency, the Government intends to limit this evaluation to only the three lowest-price quoters that have relevant past performance.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest quoter.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information concerning its most relevant three contracts that have been performed within the past three years for efforts that are similar to the Statement of Work (SOW) contained herein, to include only the name and address of the organization for which the effort was supplied, and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.  

Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.  Quoters shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 ALT I with their quotes.  This announcement will close at 1600 EST on 26 April 2007.
