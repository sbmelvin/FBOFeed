<DESC>A/B MAC Jurisdiction K (Previously Jurisdiction 13 and Jurisdiction 14) Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction K- Previously Jurisdiction 13 and Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire) on or about February 24, 2012. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is April 9, 2012 with an anticipated award date of November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>Clean Waste Containment, Transportation, & Disposal; Los Angeles County: The USGS Nevada Water Science Center, Henderson, NV, requires the containment, transportation, and disposal of clean solid wastes and the transportation and disposal of clean liquid wastes from three sites in Los Angeles County, CA where the USGS will be drilling well sites.  The task will include delivery of bins for solid waste containment, capabilities to vacuum liquid waste from a baker tank, the transportation and disposal of all clean waste in accordance with all applicable regulations.  RFQ 12PS00126 will be posted on or about 27 January 2012 and made available to all interested vendors.  The total estimated weight from the drilling sites is 300 tons of solid waste total (100 tons per site) and 450 tons of liquid waste total (150 tons per site).  All quotes received will be quoted by the ton.  The waste generated will not be contaminated or considered hazardous. The solid phase is composed of moist clays, silts, sands, and gravels.  The liquid component will be sediment laden bentonite clay drill mud.  The liquids will need to be vacuumed from the bins or USGS mud mixer and transported for disposal.  The vendor must be able to provide services with 48 hr. notice.  Multiple trips per site for both vacuum truck and bin pickup may be needed.  Locations and maps to drill sites are in the greater Los Angeles Area more specifically Lakewood (Del Ammo and Hwy 605), Los Angeles (Hwy 110 and Manchester) and Hawthorne (Hwy 110 and Hawthorne Blvd) CA.  Period of performance should begin early Mach 2012.  Duration of work at each site will be approximately 40 days.  No Government owned property will be given to the vendor.

<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability for twelve (12) space-based "TriG" Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) flight articles, providing total electron content (ionosphere), ionospheric scintillation , vertical refractivity, water vapor and temperature profiles in the troposphere. The companies should also provide options for the associated TriG-to-space vehicle integration and test support, and for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. A flight article is defined as a fully functional sensor incorporating all the development efforts from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard GNSS RO sensor.</p>
<p>Data collected from the GNSS RO sensor can be used to measure ionospheric electron density characteristics and tropospheric weather information. A prototype of the TriG GNSS RO is currently in development by JPL and will be used to support the transition from an engineering model to flight quality sensors.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:<br />This is a Sources Sought for market research purposes to identify potential organizations that can deliver the required products. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information based on independent organizations capability to deliver the TriG GNSS RO capability in a fully functional set of twelve sensors.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. This sources sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet agency future requirements, for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees and their families. DeCA seeks information from commercial sources regarding their interest and ability to solution a data warehouse /corporate data repository hardware and software environment to meet the needs of the agency. DeCA currently operates 247 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at nearly $6 billion. Of that total, 180 stores are located within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, and 67 stores located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons". It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide a significant price savings when compared to commercial markets; to provide courteous and informative assistance; to offer a variety of items in quantities and of a quality level to satisfy patron demands; and to provide products in a clean, safe, and wholesome environment. Overall management and operation of a commissary is the responsibility of the Store Director of each store, operating within Agency policy and standards.</p>
<p>Interested commercial sources are asked to provide information detailing a potential solution for the modernization of our existing data warehouse hardware and software platform. Currently, DeCA modernizes the data warehouse hardware and software every five (5) years, and is seeking state-of-the-art data warehousing options for modernization of the existing capability. The modernization may include, but is not limited to, cloud computing, virtualization, or remote data center options and/or any combination of architectural approaches that satisfy the requirement for modernization of DeCA's existing capabilities. The proposed modernization will include (at a minimum), proposed hardware and software, estimated costs, feasibility of implementation, action plans, timeline and impacts on projects (being developed or being deployed), based on our current environment, with an estimated 50% growth over the next 5 years. The page limitation for this request is set at fifty-one (51) single-sided pages, to include a one (1) page Executive Summary.</p>
<p>DeCA is expected to utilize the information obtained through this RFI process to develop its requirements for a long-term solution for EDW. The current expectation is that the long-term solution will be advertised separately at a future date. The contractor or contractors that may receive awards under any resulting solicitation would serve as the primary point(s)-of-contact for the modernization, and would be responsible for hardware and software installation and configurations, DoD security certification of hardware and software, migration and/or conversion of current Extraction Transformation and Load (ETL), scripts, queries, data, data models, reports, and projects that are currently being developed, tested, or deployed.</p>
<p>DeCA is interested in receiving information from interested commercial sources that addresses the following, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. The concepts, strategies, and considerations that a commercial source would employ to provide the necessary products and/or related services that are available.</p>
<p>2. The concepts must include proposed hardware and software, estimated costs, feasibility of implementation, action plans, timeline and impacts on projects (being developed or being deployed), based on our current environment (see Attachment 2), with an estimated 50% growth over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>3. The strategies must include DoD Security certification of hardware and software, as well as migration and/or conversion of current ETL, scripts, queries, data, data models, reports, and projects that are currently being developed, tested, or deployed. In addition, strategies for hardware and software maintenance, data loss and recovery, network latency, data retention, and methods for managing complexity and risk must be addressed.</p>
<p>4. The considerations must include possible future expansion and implementation of data repositories to support mobile applications, mobile device use while shopping, m-commerce, e-commerce and other technology advancements as requirements arise.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that an offeror has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, to the e-mail address cited below. The written query will be answered by an appropriate subject matter expert.</p>
<p>Completed packages in response to this RFI may be sent via regular mail or electronically. The requested due date for all submissions is no later than 17 February 2012. The mailing location and e-mail contact information is as follows:</p>

<p>Project Reference #: DECA-EDWRFI-2012</p>
<p>DeCA maintains a commercial website (www.commissaries.com) that can be accessed to find additional information about our organization and stores.</p>
<p>This is not a formal "Request for Proposal" (RFP), and no award will be made as a result of any submittals received in response to this request. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued. Information provided in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.

<DESC><p>This is only a sources sought announcement published for market research purposes. Submitted information will assist Region 5, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with internal acquisition planning relative to set-aside decisions, and or an appropriate level of completion and/or small business subcontracting goals. THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS. No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine the availability of small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, etc... capable of meeting the requirements of the attached performance work statement (PWS), as applicable for nationally consistent advisory and assistance to EPA On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) and other federal officials implementing EPA responsibilities under the national response system for the Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) class of contracts. These services primarily support the Emergency Response Branches in the Superfund Division at the Region 5, EPA. The contractor shall be prepared to provide scientific/technical support and align its activities with EPA activities to protect human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The primary performance of work will be conducted within Region 5 (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, and WI); however, contractors may need to respond to unforeseen national responses and be able to perform outside the region.

In Region 5, approximately 90% of the projected work will be Response Activities under the Technical Requirements of the PWS. For more information, please visit the following link: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/start/index.htm</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the ONE contract will be an Advisory and Assistance, Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) type contract starting around February 2013 with a 48 month base period, and three (3), 24 month award term options. Work will be ordered through the issuance of task orders. The estimated maximum potential value is $130 million over the life of the contract. The applicable primary NAICS code is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a small business size standard of 500 employees; smaller sub-component NAICS codes include 541620 Environmental Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $7 Million; and 541330 Engineering Services with a small business size standard of $4.5 Million.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the work described in this notice. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is contemplating enhancement of its risk analysis and surveillance programs with market-available software tools, as discussed below. <br />
<p><br />Congress formed the CFTC as an independent regulatory agency to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices in connection with the offer and sale of commodity futures and option contracts and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound commodity futures and option markets. In recent years, futures and options trading has expanded rapidly into many new markets beyond the traditional domains of physical and agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>Trading facilities now offer futures and option contracts on a vast array of instruments, including single stock, environmental, performance measures, foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices. Additionally, trading facilities have filed a significant number of new product applications and certifications, many quite innovative, covering a broad range of commodity types.</p>
<p>To safeguard the integrity of futures and options markets, the CFTC seeks to maintain trading in liquid, fair, and financially secure trading facilities by, among other things, deterring and preventing price manipulation and other disruptions to market integrity and by protecting market participants from fraudulent activity that could lead to potential market manipulations. Due to the dramatic increase of trading volume in the commodity futures market and the emergence of algorithmic computerized trading strategies as well as high frequency trading platforms, the Commission desires to broaden its technical resources for the oversight and regulation of these markets.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to make significant progress in updating its technology, data handling capabilities, and baseline analytical tools. To continue the improvement of its capabilities, CFTC has identified the following requirements for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) package that can provide enhanced portfolio analysis and risk surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>CFTC is seeking one or more COTS sources that possess the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1. Market risk management system capable of real-time market monitoring and end of day position monitoring of exchange listed futures, options, and OTC swaps (interest rate swaps, credit default swaps).<br />2. Capability to display aggregate firm account, individual or customer account, and user-level account position and monitor risk (liquidity, capital, account position).<br />3. Take in intraday transactions and prices from multiple sources and provide risk exposure data and preset risk limit alerts to Risk Analysts for real-time analysis (not batch).<br />4. Ability to scale quickly to support new instruments and data formats and ensure quality of the incoming data.<br />5. By account, capability to calculate and display risk sensitivities, risk measures or hedge parameters.<br />6. By account, capability to calculate and display daily position and daily P&amp;L. <br />7. By account, capability to calculate and display shock analyses or other scenario modeling, including effect of integration of option trees.<br />8. Capability to generate risk alerts based on pre-set triggers such as VaR and P&amp;L change thresholds.<br />9. Capability to generate and distribute automated periodic reporting.<br />10. Capability to integrate with transaction and real-time pricing data.<br />11. Capability to easily integrate with market data providers such as Interactive Data Corporation and Reuters. Data, such as large trader end-of-day positions, market data, order data, and trade data may be provided by the CFTC or directly from other sources (both commercial and non-commercial) and are considered highly sensitive. The contractor's solution should have a mechanism in place for handling this type of data - the contractor will be required to follow strict security guidelines when handling such data. <br /><br />CFTC requires a contractor to provide a COTS solution used by the options and futures industry for portfolio analysis and the surveillance of risk. Contractor's staff should have deep domain and industry experience implementing COTS solutions for FCMs (Futures Commission Merchant), SEF (Swap Execution Facilities), DCMs (Designated Contract Markets), or DCOs (Derivatives Clearing Organization).</p>
<p>The contractor's COTS solution should have the ability to provide software customization and modification if any functional gaps are identified. The COTS solution should use state of the art 64-bit multi-processor Windows technology/platform.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for on-site implementation, ongoing system maintenance support such as instrument database update, technical troubleshooting, and software updates. The contractor will also provide user support such as training.</p>
<p>CFTC encourages sources that possess one or more of the capabilities identified above to respond to this notice. Information furnished should demonstrate experience relevant to the proposed project and capabilities listed above, and should include:</p>
<p>1. A description of corporate capabilities, size (number of employees) and financial health of the company (annual revenues for the past 3 years);<br />2. A description of contractor's domain knowledge (futures/options) and software solution capabilities;<br />3. A description of the qualifications of the contractor's appropriate personnel for implementation;<br />4. A description of prior implementation experiences related to the proposed project (list of customers that are FCM, DCO, or DCM); <br />5. A description of general and special facilities, including technological capabilities of the contractor; and<br />6. Other literature which demonstrates the capabilities listed above.</p>
<p>CFTC is seeking sources that possess the identified software capabilities from both a technological and human capital implementation standpoint.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be submitted by email to ngraham@cftc.gov and received not later than February 15, 2012.</p>

<DESC><p>1.0 Description.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a Sources Sought notice to locate potential offerors for a Field Operational Experiment (FOE) and data analysis to assess driver adaptation to crash warning and avoidance products.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br /><br />Driver distraction is a key factor contributing to crash risk. Crash warning and avoidance systems are a potential solution to the driver distraction problem. Field operational tests of these technologies to date have only been short-term, not allowing for the assessment of driver adaptation and risk compensation. The Volpe Center is providing support to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in preparation for a planned 2013 agency decision on the use of crash warning and avoidance systems based on vehicle-to-vehicle communications with real-world field data. This research meets NHTSA's mission to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope<br /><br />As part of its support to NHTSA, the Volpe Center requires data collection and analysis from a FOE, conducted by a Contractor, to assess driver adaptation to vehicle-based crash warning and avoidance products based on long-term exposure in a naturalistic driving environment. The primary objectives of the FOE are to assess the safety impact and determine driver acceptance of crash warning and avoidance systems. Participants in the FOE will drive instrumented vehicles equipped with crash warning and avoidance products in place of their personal cars or work vehicles, driving wherever, whenever, and however they choose. The driving is thereby largely unmanaged by the Contractor and derives, instead, from the personal mobility needs of the individual participants. The primary deliverables from the FOE will be a dataset that captures driver-vehicle performance and the driving environment, and an analysis of this dataset.</p>
<p>Objective and subjective data will need to be collected and analyzed to meet the FOE objectives. Objective data are obtained based on observable evidence, undistorted by emotion or personal bias of the FOE participants. Objective data generally consist of numerical and video data that capture host vehicle states and maneuvers, surrounding traffic, system operation, and driver behavior. Data acquisition systems (DAS) will be installed to collect numerical and video data.</p>
<p>Subjective data are collected to obtain driver background information before participation in the FOE, and to assess driver perception and opinion of the crash warning and avoidance product in terms of ease of use and learning, willingness to use, and safety impact after their participation in the FOE.</p>
<p>4.0 Submission Instructions. <br /><br />The U.S. DOT is seeking a capability statement from all interested parties who can perform the data collection and analysis from a FOE. All capability information submitted by respondents shall include: Summary that outlines personnel and teaming partners (if any) having technical capabilities, knowledge, and expertise to perform the FOE, deal with test subjects, install DAS equipment, handle very large multi-media datasets, and to conduct statistical analysis to achieve program objectives; Contract number; Customer (Government agency or private industry); Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers; contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of the company to provide the described services. All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than five (5) pages. Page size is set at 8&frac12; x 11 inches; text font must be no smaller than 12 point; and text should be doubled spaced. Each response must reference the Sources Sought title and number. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 15 calendar days of publication (no later than February 10, 2012, 3:00 PM, Eastern Time). Telephone requests will not be honored. All responses must be submitted via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Carl Chin at Carl.Chin@dot.gov. Electronic attachments to the e-mail should be submitted in Microsoft Office 2007 (or later) productivity application formats, or any format that can be imported by Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>5.0 Information Availability. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice is for information and planning purposes only, and is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and possible issuance of a Request for Proposal, including the use of any non-profit organization or small business program. The notice does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotations, and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of response to this Sources Sought notice. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender. Submissions must be disclosable to the public or the submitter should provide a summary statement that can be disclosed to the public with fuller supporting information that is clearly marked as restricted. The Government will use customary means to safeguard proprietary information, but only when such information is (1) clearly marked as proprietary; (2) is, in fact, information that could not have been obtained from another party or source; and (3) is otherwise deserving of such treatment under standards and processes described in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Executive Order 12600.</p>

Good treatment result requires attention to operational practices as well as the chemistry used to treat the cooling system.  Specifically, systems that are not continuously re-circulated, and left full of water for periods of time longer than a day are prone to corrosion, despite chemical treatment.  This elevated corrosion potential comes from a variety of causes, including corrosion barrier failure, microbiological growth rate increases and increased under-deposit of corrosion rates.<br><br>Recommended chemical products will minimize corrosion in your systems; if water circulation is not maintained, chemical residuals are not adhered to and water quality is not maintained; desired corrosion protection will not be realized.  Additionally, desired chemical treatment results can be defeated through a lack of care regarding operational impacts on the chemistry program.    <br><br>Corrosion Control:<br>Use a product to minimize corrosion in the cooling system. <br>Product must be formulated to minimize corrosion and maintain as clean as possible all metal surfaces within the cooling system.  Any corrosion product requires continual water circulation to maintain a corrosion barrier film at optimum levels. <br>Any extended period of time without water circulation will permit the barrier film to rupture; exposing bare metal which will cause increased corrosion rates at those barrier film ruptures.<br><br>Corrosion monitoring involves the use of corrosion coupons of appropriate metallurgy and monitoring metal ion levels in the cooling water itself.  Monthly monitoring results will be included in routine service reports.<br><br>Microbiological Control:<br>Treatment program must address bacteria growth in closed loop cooling systems to control closed loop system microbiological growth to minimize corrosion potential. <br>Monthly analyze the effectiveness of this program and perform additional corrective measures, as needed. <br>Monitoring with be by aerobic bacteria agar dipslides taken quarterly on each closed loop system.<br>Acceptable aerobic bacteria count is < 104 cfu and controlling the bacteria at that level means biofilm formation is minimized. <br>Additional this level of microbiological control must assist in minimize corrosion and minimize particulate deposition problems as well. <br><br>Microbiological control is very sensitive to a lack of water circulation in the cooling system and without microbiocide mixing and contact throughout the system, microbiological growth can accelerate.  <br>Out of control microbiological growth causes significant corrosion, normally referred to as Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion. <br>Heat transfer inefficiencies are also experienced, when the cooling system is placed back in service, if microbiological growth is permitted to go unchecked, untreated and biofilm builds up to the point of acting as an insulator.  <br><br>Chemical Feed and Monitoring Equipment:<br>Use equipment manufacturers' recommendation to achieve optimum chemical treatment success in the cooling systems. <br><br>Recommended Equipment<br>Neptune FTF Filter Feeder (5-gallon)<br>Slight Flow Indicator  -inch<br>50 Micron Filter Bag<br>Schedule 80 PVC Corrosion Coupon test rack (3 station)<br>Insertable Corrosion Coupon Holder <br> <br><br>TESTING<br>a.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Housing Specialist (Inspector)

The Washington DC VAMC has identified a need to provide assistance to chronically homeless veterans in the Washington DC metropolitan area.  The HUD-VASH Program works with the Public Housing Administration (PHA) within the District of Columbia and surrounding counties. At present the Washington DC VAMC has vouchers that are managed by the District of Columbia, Prince George's County, Montgomery County and Northern Virginia. The Housing Inspector will need to become familiar with rental properties located in these areas where the vouchers are located. 
Mental Health is seeking a contractor to assist with the provision of residential placement and supportive services through the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. This contract is designed to serve homeless Veterans in need of immediate placement in a safe environment. Many of these veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other serious medical conditions. VA intends to engage a Contractor to improve the ability to rapidly place veterans in a supportive, residential setting. 
There is a continuous effort by HUD, the VA and PHA's to provide permanent housing for homeless veterans within the District and the surrounding counties. Once veterans receive the HUD/VASH voucher, they are responsible for locating an appropriate unit to lease. HUD and the local Housing Authority requires that the unit has to be inspected by a company or individual who has the primary Housing Quality Standards (HQS) at 24 CFR 982.401 qualifications. 

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets standards for
housing receiving federal assistance. The primary standards are the Housing Quality
Standards (HQS) at 24 CFR 982.401. The HQS were adopted in 1995 and last revised in
1999. All housing funded through HUD's Housing Choice Vouchers (formerly known as
Tenant-Based Section 8 Voucher) must comply HQS as a condition of receiving funding.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		5120-00-NIB-0001<br />Name:		Hammer - 2 lb, Engineer's, 16" Fiberglass Handle<br />Description:	Two (2) pound engineer's hammer or short handle sledge, used to strike stone, concrete, metal, and wood.

<DESC><br />THE INTENT OF THIS BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT IS <br />TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT-UNIVERSITY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS <br />FOR THE NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND<br /><br />INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting white papers from universities, colleges, and educational research institutes to establish Cooperative Agreements (CAs) to collaborate in a broad range of research areas. Cooperative Agreements are a legal instrument defining a relationship between the United States Government and a State, or local College or University or other recipient where 1) the principal purpose is to transfer a thing of value to the State, local government, and / or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of acquiring (by purchase lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government; and 2) substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, College, University or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.</p>
<p>NAVAIR is pursuing agreements to research revolutionary capabilities for US Naval forces to mature and transition advances in Science and Technology (S&amp;T). This is to improve US Naval capabilities, respond to current critical needs, maintain broad technology investments to anticipate and counter potential technology surprises. To support this mission, the white paper must provide S&amp;T solutions that will enable the future force while simultaneously seizing opportunities to enhance current readiness. White papers must also discuss the potential commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market.</p>
<p>NAVAIR S&amp;T challenges are, broad and inherently multidisciplinary in nature. S&amp;T core capabilities being developed at NAVAIR include but are not limited to, structures, avionics, materials science, aerodynamics, navigation, sensors, human factors, propulsion and power. These efforts will be conducted primarily at the agreement holder's site but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The purpose of this broad agency announcement is to establish a cooperative agreement(s) between NAVAIR and universities, colleges, or other educational research Institutes to advance basic and applied research in support of Naval Aviation.

<p>3) Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD), if applicable.</p>
<p>(2) VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, but should address funding periods of performance. Formal work breakdown structures (WBS) and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired. However, NAVAIR reserves the right to request this information. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order:</p>
<p>Section 1 - Total Project Cost. Provide a summary sheet outlining the total cost by project, including labor, material, and travel for each project proposed and a total cost for the entire proposal. In addition, provide a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken down for each task appearing in the Statement of Work (SOW) and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share; funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, escalation, fee or profit, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Documents may include DCAA Forward Pricing Rate Agreements, payroll verification, three years of historical actual indirect rates, and invoices or quotes for material purchases. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors' cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions?</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements.</p>
<p>6. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other.</p>
<p>6.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The primary evaluation criteria are:</p>
<p>a) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered<br />b) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives<br />c) The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. AWARDS</p>
<p>NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated in Section 2 and 3. All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of an agreement.</p>

Description:  RF Energy Assessment & Safety Program Development
1.  Requirement
The James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center; 2907 Pleasant Valley Blvd; Altoona, Pennsylvania has a requirement for a Contractor Certified in Utilities Safety Administration to complete a Professional RF Energy On-Site Hazard and Miscellaneous Safety Assessment.  From the Assessment, the successful Contractor will establish an internal Safety Program for the medical center and provide initial face to face training to medical center staff who work in close proximity to or may be exposed for RF radiation by RF producing equipment.  Additionally, the successful Contractor shall be required to provide annual refresher training on RF exposure and safety guidelines that may have changed since the original and subsequent refresher training was provided.  The contract awarded as a result of this RFQ will be for a base period of one year for the initial deliverables, and four additional one year option periods for the provision of refresher training.
2.  Contractor and Contractor Employee Qualifications
The successful Contractor shall possess certification in Utilities Safety Administration and have successfully completed the same or similar assessments and safety planning for other Government Agencies and the private sector.  The Contractor's staff completing the study should have practical safety and working knowledge necessary to gather and analyze data collected and communicate the results of the data in a clear understandable manner for the Government to understand.  The Government personnel who will be receiving and reviewing the Professional RF Energy On-Site Hazard and Miscellaneous Safety Assessment, Safety Plan, and training should be assumed to have little to no familiarity with the technical terms and/or understanding RF emissions.   All of the Contractor's staff shall be versed in the safety requirements regarding RF emissions per the standards established by the FCC, particularly those of OET Bulletin 65, and OSHA.  At a minimum the final assessment, safety plan, and training must be reviewed and certified by a Professional Engineer who is also certified in Utilities Safety Administration.  The Contractor shall submit the names and qualifications, including any certifications, of key personnel who will be completing the assessment, developing the Safety Program, and developing and providing the safety training.
3.  Duties and Responsibilities
The successful Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, analysis, testing, and other professional services as required in order to establish an RF Compliance and Safety Program at the Altoona Van Zandt VA Medical Center. The initial requirements will be to record field readings and provide a comprehensive written report concerning the available sources of RF energy and the resultant potential hazards to employees. An assessment will detect the actual levels of RF energy and document all locations which are above the FCC Standards for human exposure to RF radiation. The report will determine which personnel assessable/work areas should be classified as hot or danger areas which contain RF levels above the occupation -controlled limits. The report should also include recommendations for any possible mitigation of potential safety and health hazards which could result in violations of the FCC/OSHA rules governing employee protection from maximum RF radiation exposure (MPE). This report should include the contributions of all sources, including malfunctioning equipment if found, of localized RF energy including the two cellular tower systems located on the medical center's roof as well as the Medical Center's RF producing equipment. This RF Compliance and Safety Report must be certified by a professional engineer.
4.  Deliverables  
a.	The Contractor shall complete an initial Professional RF Energy On-Site Hazard and Miscellaneous Safety Assessment within 30 days of award of this contract.  The assessment shall look at potential exposure risks to RF emissions near and around the RF emitting equipment located on the medical center's roof and within the upper floors of the medical center to determine if there is risk of exposure to the general public working within the medical center proper.  The Contractor shall also look for and identify any other apparent safety issues in the vicinity of the roof that pose a risk to employee and Contractor safety when accessing the roof to perform work.

b.	Upon completion of the assessment, the Contractor shall develop and provide a written and detailed Safety Program based upon the findings during the assessment within 45 days of award of this contract.  The safety Program shall include a comprehensive list of All Hazards which are found to be present, not just RF exposure hazards with suggestions to mitigate the identified hazards and/or risks posed by those hazards.  The program should identify hot zones, safe areas, and time limits that are acceptable for a person to be within each area.  The final report will be shared with the medical center's third party tenants who have equipment located on the roof and other Contractors who perform work on the roof or within identified hot zone areas, if any are identified in other locations within and around the medical center.

c.	Contractor will establish and develop an initial in-house certification safety training program which will be based upon the results obtained from the site survey and information contained in the Safety Program.  This In-house program will be presented to personnel who may have a need to access the potentially hazardous areas during the performance of their job duties.  Approximately 20 VA personnel will participate in the initial training.  The training shall be held at the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania within 60 days of the award of the contract.  The instructor for the training should be a certified OSHA trainer.  Training shall include the recommendation of and the proper use of Personal Protection RF energy monitoring equipment. The certification training shall fulfill the requirements of OSHA CFR 1910.268.  The Contractor shall also provide a written transcript of the training or PowerPoint version of the training so that VA may provide the training to new employees and/or Contractor personnel as needed.

d.	The Contractor shall develop and maintain a yearly recurrent online training program for refresher training.  The on-line training will insure continued certification for compliance with RF safety and will cover any new changes in the RF Safety arena, specifically OSHA and FCC safety guidelines.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services.  The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support.   The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03.   In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems.  This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).  The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements:  Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED).  Emerging requirements for which SETA support would be required include Integrated Ground Security Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C); Tactical Security System (TSS); and Tunneling Detection. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) in which Task Orders may be issued and will be for a one  year base period, a first option period of one year and a second option period of three months.  The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders.  The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.  NAICS Code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.  Proposals shall be due no later than 2:00 pm on 2 March 2012.  Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Phylis Ross at phylis.g.ross @us.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br><br>The solicitation number is W911QY-12-R-0006 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-53, effective July 5, 2011.  This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing. <br><br>The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds.  Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12.  Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds.  <br><br>The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and from the Natick Contracting Division website https://www3.natick.army.mil.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br><br>This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation.  The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit (e.g., wipe, gel, spray, and ancillary equipment such as glove(s), sponge(s), towel, etc) intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired: <br><br>- Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to  1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application. <br>- Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4. <br>- Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process. <br>- Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors. <br>- Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products.<br><br>Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 4) and decontaminate chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. Potential solutions for JSEW include, but are not limited to, a wipe impregnated with a decontaminant; a dry wipe; a decontaminant applied via a wipe and removed with a second wipe; multiple wipes contained in a single package; a spray bottle of decontaminant with some form of removal media; a gel applied to the surface and peeled off, or other configuration that meets the requirements of the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA). The Offeror is to consider "one each" as all of the necessary components, packaged together as one item or kit, necessary to decontaminate sensitive or non-sensitive equipment as specified in the PSPEC.  <br>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. GSAÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 06/06/11.  The solicitation is available electronically at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-F8-03-0056-B (include the dashes). Schedule 56, Buildings and Building Materials/Industrial Services and Supplies, includes the following programs: FSC 39, Warehouse Equipment and Supplies; FSC 46, Air & Water Purification and Sewer Treatment Equipment; FSC 49, Maintenance & Repair Shop Equipment; FSC 54, Pre-Engineered/Prefabricated Buildings and Structures; FSC 54, Above Ground Storage Tanks; FSC 56, Building Materials; FSC 61, Power Distribution Equipment; Generators, & Batteries; FSC 62, Solar Energy Systems & Lighting Products.  Schedule 56 actively solicits offers for alternative/renewable energy products and systems, energy efficient products, green products, such as green roof systems, and environmentally friendly products/services.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective January 17, 2011, products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers  (SINs) 206-4, Energy Saving Lighting, Energy Efficient and/or Environmentally Friendly Lamps (light bulbs)  
Lighting Fixtures and Accessories, Indoor Emergency Lighting, Reading Lights, Lighting Sensor Systems ; 563-25, Plumbing Products and Bathroom Fixtures; 563-28,  Industrial and Commercial Electric and Gas Water Heaters, Boiled Water Heaters, including options and accessories, either by new offer or modification must meet the following Government standards.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contracts include products that are energy-efficient (ENERGY STAR qualified or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated).  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these three SINs on Schedule 56, which will require ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœgreenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â qualifications where applicable.  For SIN  206-4, all light bulbs including fixtures with light bulbs, must meet Energy Star or  Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements (where applicable), and be qualified Energy Star or FEMP compliant.  Energy Star lighting specifications can be obtained through the website at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires.  Information on how products earn the ENERGY STAR label can be found at
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn.   Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices.  Product designation process for FEMP can be found at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep_fempdesignatedproducts.html.     For SIN 563-25 all toilets, urinals, bathroom faucets and shower heads must meet WaterSense requirements and be certified as WaterSense compliant by obtaining certification through the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at http://www.epa.gov/Watersense/about_us/watersense_label.html.  For SIN 563-28, all gas water heaters must meet either Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements and be certified Energy Star or FEMP compliant. Certification for Energy Star can be obtained through the website at  www.energystar.gov.
Product designation process for FEMP can be found at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep_fempdesignatedproducts.html.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the Energy Star, FEMP or EPA website.   Dealers using their own part numbers must also list the corresponding manufacturer part number.  To determine if you are submitting items that are listed in one of the luminaries specifications for items offered under SIN 206 4 please go to http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires and review the ENERGY STAR Luminaries V1.0 Final Specification document.  If the products offered meet the eligibility criteria they must be ENERGY STAR qualified. If they do not meet the criteria (i.e. - there is no available specifications for the items offered), please make that attestation in writing.  The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation.

The scope of the contract will include continued specialized engineering and technical services (ETS) in support of the STANDARD Missile program including systems engineering, design agent services, and engineering technical services (which could include evaluation, component improvement, and production proofing services).  Raytheon is the sole manufacturer of the STANDARD Missile and the only company with the requisite expertise, knowledge, experience and facilities necessary to meet ETS requirements for the STANDARD Missile program.
  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Company directly.  Interested parties have until close of business February 10, 2012 to submit inquiries, referencing solicitation number N00024-12-R-5403.

The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received within forty-five days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) webpage located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) webpage located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While FBO is the single Government point-of-entry (GPE) for the posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in the event FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br>(ii) Examples.<br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br>(1) Listed End Product<br>Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin:<br>  	  <br>  	  <br>  	  <br>(2) Certification.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br><br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:<br><br>Solicitation:<br>ITEM NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br>0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	 20	EA	 	 <br>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:<br>ITEM NO.

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

      filtering eliminates waveform
      artifact/noise.  System allows cuff
      inflator to automatically decrease the
      inflation rate (once pressure threshold
      is reached) to minimize the
      overpressure. This feature saves
      operator time and reduces patient
      discomfort.  System should allow user
      to record waves/perform tests without
      the use of the computer/printer.
      System features should result in
      consistent, step-free bleed-down rates.
      This capability results in maximum
      blood pressure display & measurement
      resolution for accuracy over the full
      range of BP cuff size.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>?

The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC>Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. GSA&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&euro;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&trade;s Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 06/06/11.

Schedule 56 actively solicits offers for alternative/renewable energy products and systems, energy efficient products, green products, such as green roof systems, and environmentally friendly products/services. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective January 17, 2011, products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers (SINs) 206-4, Energy Saving Lighting, Energy Efficient and/or Environmentally Friendly Lamps (light bulbs) Lighting Fixtures and Accessories, Indoor Emergency Lighting, Reading Lights, Lighting Sensor Systems ; 563-25, Plumbing Products and Bathroom Fixtures; 563-28, Industrial and Commercial Electric and Gas Water Heaters, Boiled Water Heaters, including options and accessories, either by new offer or modification must meet the following Government standards. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contracts include products that are energy-efficient (ENERGY STAR qualified or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated). In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these three SINs on Schedule 56, which will require &Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&euro;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&oelig;green&Atilde;&fnof;&Acirc;&cent;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&euro;&Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc; qualifications where applicable.

Dealers using their own part numbers must also list the corresponding manufacturer part number. To determine if you are submitting items that are listed in one of the luminaries specifications for items offered under SIN 206 4 please go to http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires and review the ENERGY STAR Luminaries V1.0 Final Specification document. If the products offered meet the eligibility criteria they must be ENERGY STAR qualified. If they do not meet the criteria (i.e. - there is no available specifications for the items offered), please make that attestation in writing. The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001<br /><br /><br />The attached powerpoint slide provides the general layout of the weather forecast office which I use during the vendor's site visit. However, keep in mind that some of the furniture and cubicle furniture has been changed since this original layout was made. The individual rooms are not labeled either nor are the type of flooring indicated in the attached layout. Also, although the total square footage is about 5,000 sq. ft, not all of the rooms will require daily cleaning. That is why it is important for the vendors to do the site visit. Below is the breakdown of the amount of carpet, tile, etc from the statement of work that is in the office.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>This solicitation is modified to answer questions that have been asked and to include an offer checklist.&nbsp; <br /><br />Added Jan 18, 2012<br /><br />THE SOLICITATION CLOSE DATE AND TIME IS EXTENDED TO 01 FEBRUARY 2012 AT 4:30 PM EST.<br /><br /><br />Added Jan 26, 2012</strong></p>

<p>Replace with:<br /><br />"The affiliation rule applies in accordance with 13 CFR 121.103."</p>
<p>The modified Paragraph B. BASIC INFORMATION will read as follows:</p>
<p>"A service, performance-based type contract with a period of performance of one-year basic effort with two one-year options is anticipated. This effort is anticipated to be less than $5M total. Potential sources are being sought who can provide the requirements established in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), either in-house or through prospective subcontractors. Contract Teaming Arrangements are desirable if they offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost and delivery. The affiliation rule applies in accordance with 13 CFR 121.103. Based on the evaluation of responses, the Government reserves the right to set-aside this acquisition for a small business program. Foreign-owned firms are advised they will not be allowed to participate at the prime contractor level."</p>

<DESC>National Subsistence Prime Vendor Solicitation, Department of Veterans Affairs

The modification of this announcement is to incorporate a change to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code to 311999.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has determined a continued need for a National Prime Vendor contract for the purchase and distribution of subsistence commodities and ancillary foodservice supplies for 156 VA Medical Centers (VAMC), 171 Veterans Canteen Service retail foodservice sites, and some (90) Other Government Agencies (OGAs) healthcare facilities authorized to purchase from this contract.  The National Acquisition Center intends to solicit proposals for an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity firm fixed price contract of one-base year and four one-year option periods.  The estimated value of the base year is $191,400,000.  One contract will be awarded for service to all 50 States and Puerto Rico. 

 A broad variety of food and foodservice supplies are required to meet the varied food production and service needs of the SPV participating customers.  Fresh bread, fresh milk, and produce are excluded from this contract.  National food distributors and teamed efforts of regional food distributors are encouraged to submit proposals. Further details on the scope and requirements for this solicitation will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP).  Award will be made based on best value, which is determined to be the most advantageous and of the greatest value to the Government based on the offerors ability to meet or exceed the technical requirements provided in the RFP and price.

The Subsistence Prime Vendor Request for Proposals is anticipated to be posted on or around August 19, 2011 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The due date for proposal submission is anticipated to be October 6, 2011.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 311999.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. 

Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted by email to Christine.Szrom@va.gov, Contracting Officer.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP VA-797-11-RP-0176.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. 

CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact unable to maintain a bidder's mailing list.  It is therefore the responsibility of interested parties to periodically access http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal. 

This is not a Request for Proposal and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC><p>Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to enter into a 20 year lease for approximately 1.011 acres of improved land for National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Program (PTWP) office to be located at 95-1007 Honu'apo Road, Naalehu, Hawaii 96772.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>NOAA's role is to provide tsunami detection, forecasting and warnings for the Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean regions, the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico [The Tsunami Warning and Education Act of 2007, 33 U.S.C. &sect; 3201, et seq., (P.L. 109-479)]. With regard to tsunamis, the mission of NOAA's National Weather Service is to protect lives and property from tsunami hazards by providing timely, accurate, reliable, and effective tsunami information to coastal populations and emergency management within its area of responsibility; and by advancing other aspects of tsunami hazard mitigation such as community preparedness and public education. This is accomplished though NOAA's Tsunami Warning Centers, National Weather Service Forecast Offices, Tsunami Ready, and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program.</p>
<p>The Pacific (Hawaii) Regional Tsunami Warning System was set up in 1970 by the University of Hawaii as a contracted experiment for the Honolulu Observatory. The experiment was a success and the system was turned over to the Honolulu Observatory, NOAA/NWS. The original Tsunami monitoring gauge was destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami of November 29, 1975. A license agreement was reached with the Ka'u Sugar Company in 1977. The tsunami instrumentation shelter was re-built on the Ka'u Sugar Company's property. Data from the gauge is telemetered in real-time to the Honolulu Observatory at Ewa Beach, on Oahu. The property has been sold to a private land owner, Mr. Richard Alderson in March 2009.</p>
