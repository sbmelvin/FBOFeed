<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />RFP-PCC-0022<br />CAR XV</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has two requirements for the management and operation of a contractor-owned/contractor-leased, contractor-operated correctional facility. Each requirement is to house approximately 1,565 to 2,000 low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror may submit for only one requirement or both requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement A:<br /><br /></strong>Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility must be located in one of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or New York. This requirement is to house approximately 1,565 to 2,000 low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. <br /><br /><strong>Requirement B:<br /></strong><br />Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility may be located anywhere in the continental United States. This requirement is to house approximately 1,565 to 2,000 low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. <br /><br /><strong>Both Requirements:<br /><br /></strong>The BOP intends to award a Performance-based, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and three (3) two-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based work statement based on American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Additionally, services received from or provided to the resulting contract shall not be shared with other contractual obligations.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. An Environmental Impact Statement&nbsp;may be required prior to award. The offeror's proposal cannot contain any proposal or action that could, in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, significantly impact the quality of the human environment as determined by either: (1) a consideration of the offeror's proposal under the National Environmental Policy Act; or (2) lack of said consideration due to the failure of the offeror's proposal to contain sufficient information for the Bureau to conduct a complete analysis.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Prisons intends for performance to begin on either Requirement A or Requirement B no later than 06/01/2015.</p>
<p>The contractor shall obtain the appropriate authority from state or local law enforcement agencies to use force as necessary, (consistent with applicable policies of the federal government) to maintain the security of the institution. Proof of this authority shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 90 days after the deadline for receipt of proposals.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or after 04/09/2013, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on 05/24/2013. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the federal government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for CCR is www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System code for this solicitation is 561210, Facilities Support Services. Interested parties requiring further information should email Michael Bodine, Contract Specialist, at mbodine@bop.gov or Timothy Barnes, Contract Specialist, at tbarnes@bop.gov.</p>

<DESC>It is the intention of the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into negotiations solely with SEMA Construction, Inc. for the purpose of replacing the asphaltic surfacing and cable /post guardrail on the dam that were removed as a part of the dam safety modification contract and rotomill and resurface the access road from State Highway 83 to the dam.  SEMA Construction, Inc. is the prime contractor currently performing the necessary dam modifications at Red Willow.  They must be complete with approximately 97% of the original contract work before any work associated with paving the dam crest or the access road overlay may commence.  The contract completion date is November 2013.  Because the Government cannot guarantee with absolute certainty when SEMA will be at 97% completion, it would be extremely difficult to award a separate contract for paving the dam crest and access road overlay, without directing SEMA to accelerate their performance or delay performance on a sompetitive road contract.  Therefore, the Government has justified our determination to proceed with a sole source negotiated modification to SEMA for this additional work in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, due to unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement.  The Bureau of Reclamation's Bureau Procurement Chief has approved a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) in support of our determination to proceed with negotiations solely with SEMA Construction for this work.  The JOFOC will be made publically available at the Government Point of Entry within 30 days after the modification has been executed.

<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons projects aim to accurately and precisely measure metabolites of PAHs in human urine to quantify exposure. The large number of samples to run requires better automation of sample preparation, which is a rate determining step in sample analysis. An automated sample preparation system must perform the major analytical and sample handling steps in sample extraction and purification and must be able to handle samples in both 96-well plate and sample vial format to prepare samples in a shorter period of time with necessary flexibility for samples to be analyzed on LC/MS/MS. The Government has conducted extensive research and determined that Spark Holland has the only autosampler system which contains the unique features the government is seeking.</p>
<p><strong>System Description<br /></strong>The Spark Holland online-SPE with ALIAS<sup>TM</sup> autosampler is an automated system able to prepare biological specimens, such as urine and serum, for analysis by LC/MS/MS. It can perform all liquid handling and sample handling steps, and provide sample extraction and purification automatically. It can handle samples in both 96-well plate and sample vial format to prepare samples. It has state-of-the-art injection technology with fast injection and wash cycles. It has efficient, multisolvent needle wash virtually eliminates carry-over. It provides 4&deg;C sample cooling. It is compact with a stackable design which helps with the efficient usage of lab space. The Spark Holland online-SPE with ALIAS<sup>TM</sup> autosampler, among all other vendors' sample preparation systems examined, has the following required, unique and demonstrated features: a) capability to replace online SPE cartridges with Automatic Cartridge Exchange (ACE) at a designated intervals between samples; (b) High pressure dispenser (HPD) can allow as many as 24 different solvents, with a flow rate 0.1-10 mL/min, and high pressure tolerance which is very beneficial for online-SPE LC/MS/MS applications and method development; and c) dual mode of syringes, ACE clamps maximize throughput.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. The Government will issue only one solicitation to SPARK HOLLAND, Inc. However, the Government will review all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determines if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capabilities statements must be sent to: Matthew Ellington at: mce8@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-Q-15464 referenced in the subject line no later than 4:00PM EST., April 8, 2013.</p>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid. The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify potential offerors of the Navys requirement under RFP N40084-13-R-0002, for a Design-Build Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Construction Contract at US Navy Support Facility, Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).  The project will be solicited as an unrestricted procurement using the source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.101
and 15.3. The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit price and technical proposals. Evaluation of proposals will be based on price and technical evaluation factors, as stated in the solicitation, with contract award to be made to the offeror submitting the best value to the Government.
   The contract resulting from this solicitation will result in contract award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the US Government, considering price and technical evaluation factors.  The work includes, but is not limited to, labor, supervision, tools, materials and equipment necessary to perform new construction, repair, and/or alteration of existing infrastructure.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a twelve month
Base Period and four twelve-month Option Periods, for a total maximum duration of sixty  months.  

The estimated dollar value, including the Base Period and Four Option Periods is $90,000,000.
  The minimum task order limitation will be established at $150,000, with an unspecified maximum task order amount. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of between $3,000,000 and $10,000,000 is guaranteed to be ordered under the performance period of the contract.  The minimum guarantee amount will be determined prior at the RFP release.  The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the Base Period or Option Periods. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.
  There are no additional minimum guarantees obligated for each Option year.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with an annual size standard of $33.5M. At the time of proposal, interested parties must consist of a Joint-Venture effort between a United States firm (minimum 60%) and a United Kingdom firm (minimum 20%).  In any U.S. /U.K. joint ventures, management control will be vested in the U.S. partner or partners.

Anticipate a one-time pre-proposal conference and site visit on or about March, 2013 in Diego Garcia, which will be restricted to registered plan-holder firms only.  Due to the logistical constraints posed by the location, each firm will be allowed only three attendees on the site visit.
 

Each pre-proposal conference and site visit request must include the following information: full name, gender, citizenship, nationality, name of firm being represented, position/title, social security number, complete company and home address, passport number (place of issuance, date of issue, expiration date), and e-mail address(es).  

Due to the lead time required for visitors to receive area clearance to Diego Garcia, it is imperative that each firm provide the above information to the Contracting Officer within 5 business days from receipt of the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Failure to submit all required information by the date to be determined at the time of the issuance of the RFP will preclude the firms eligibility to participate in the site visit and pre-proposal conference.
 No additional names will be accepted after the registration deadline.  

It is the responsibility of the plan-holder to arrange for transportation to Singapore.  A Government-sponsored MAC (AMC) flight will be available to transport plan-holders from Paya Lebar, Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Base, Singapore, to Diego Garcia.  Contractors are responsible for the cost of the AMC flight which is approximately $2,500 roundtrip from Singapore to Diego Garcia.  At the time of the flight request to Diego Garcia, the contractor must also provide the contractor billing information in order for the U.S. Government to bill the contractor. 

It is highly recommended that flight arrangements to Singapore allow for significant flexibility in the event that the scheduled MAC flight becomes delayed or encounters unscheduled changes.

The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
 This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for efforts that will advance and demonstrate science and technology for the next generation electronics and devices under the following focus area:
<p>Electronics technology enablers for wideband Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) capabilities</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The need for concurrent military antenna operations across wide spectral ranges in heavily congested electromagnetic environments continues to expand. Steady advances in RF and mixed-signal electronics technology continue to fuel increased system performance capabilities through the use of higher operating frequencies and broader bandwidths. Higher resolution for active sensors/imagers, higher data rate terrestrial and satellite communications links, and more effective electronic warfare (EW) and Information Operations (IO) are a few of the advances that high-speed electronics continues to enable. Many solid state device technologies from Silicon to Gallium Nitride, Niobium to Photonics, are contributing to these military system advances. Significant electronic challenges arise when these EW/IO, communications and radar systems are required to operate concurrently, with both transmit and receive functionality utilizing either a single aperture or multiple apertures. The concurrency problem is exasperated by the desire of each system to project more power from smaller overall platform footprints in order to maximize performance and minimize signature. While electronics technology advances have led to significant military antenna system performance gains, the ability to operate these systems concurrently in a STAR configuration without severe performance degradation continues to be severely lacking. The need for improved wideband STAR enabling electronics technology is the primary focus of this BAA.</p>

<DESC><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Protective Service (FPS) Region 3 has a requirement to obtain armed protective security officer (PSO) services for federally-owned or leased facilities throughout the State of Delaware.&nbsp; A competitive 5-year indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract consisting of a 1-year base and four 1-year option periods for PSO services is contemplated to maintain continuity of operations and ensure that FPS meets its mission requirements of safeguarding federal employees and federal property, as well as citizens at these locations throughout the State of Delaware.&nbsp; The required class of security guard services is Guard II, and FPS requires a mix of fixed and roving armed PSOs providing interior and exterior coverage, with some posts requiring 24-hour coverage across 11 locations.&nbsp; These essential security services include access control to facility entrances and exits, employee and visitor identification checks, monitoring security equipment, and roving patrols of the interior and exterior of federal facilities. This requirement will be satisfied through task order acquisition.&nbsp; It is anticipated that a&nbsp;forthcoming request for proposal (RFP) will focus on&nbsp;small business concerns; however, a final determination has yet to be made regarding target business size.&nbsp; The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561612, which falls under the scope of Protective Guard Services. The planned period of performance for the subsequent IDIQ shall encompass a base period of twelve months - 01 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 and includes four (4) 12-month option periods.</p>

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC><p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, is conducting market research in order to capture market capabilities with respect to the E2D2 requirements as listed below. This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All large and small businesses capable of providing these services are encouraged to respond. Respondents to this notice should indicate whether they qualify as a large or small business under NAICS Code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services - size standard $7.0M.

<p><strong>Service Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>The Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) is the innovation arm of Air Force Space Command. The mission of the SIDC is to advance warfighter success through innovation and integration of capability. One of the focus areas within the SIDC is the research and development of data fusion techniques for OPIR as well as other sensor data. OPIR provides the capability to identify sources of infrared signatures anywhere on the globe. This capability is critical to our national security. In addition, previous R&amp;D efforts have proven that fusion of OPIR data with other available data can provide a more defined and accurate operational picture. The deployment of existing and more capable space sensors has also contributed to the need to further explore the fusing of data to improve our ability to identify objects. Performance under this effort will include annual O&amp;M work to integrate existing technologies and efforts for the exploration and presentation of approaches in a research and development environment for collecting, processing and exploiting end-to end development OPIR ground stations and sensors with various existing OPIR assets.</p>
<p>The approach to E2D2 requirements follows a logical flow to the Tasking, Collecting, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) model. The contractor will be required to demonstrate the end-to-end process starting with collecting all the way through to possible dissemination. Following this model, the first step is Tasking. Although the contractor is not required to demonstrate "tasking" events, he/she will be required to know and understand all OPIR assets, and know which taskings belong to which assets. The second step in the model is Collecting. The contractor shall collect existing data from OPIR and intelligence assets. In the third step, Processing, the contractor will be required to process new data sources while applying innovative processing techniques. The fourth step is exploitation of the collected and processed data, the contractor may be required to recommend changes to Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) all the way up to performing actual algorithm development. In the fifth step, Dissemination, the contractor may be required to present approaches for disseminating the new capability via an operational picture or by other means selected by the government. (See attachment 2)</p>
<p>The contractor must, from an overarching perspective, be able to explore and present the following approaches in an R&amp;D environment using the aforementioned logical flow model from end-to-end.</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall explore and present approaches in a research and development environment for collecting data from OPIR ground stations and sensors as well as other select assets for processing.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall demonstrate the processing of data to obtain new and innovative ways of improving what data/information can be provided for battlespace awareness.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall exploit and potentially disseminate data after collecting and processing data to provide enhanced battlespace awareness.<br /><br />4. The contractor shall apply best business practices and a sound program management approach to all efforts placed on contract.</p>
<p>In addition, the government has identified seven performance areas that respondents should demonstrate capability performing. (The areas are not listed in any specific order of importance).</p>
<p>1. Tasking, Collecting, Processing, Exploiting and Disseminating (TCPED) System End-to-End<br /><br />Has contractor successfully performed TCPED end-to-end development among OPIR assets and other assets where at least one Ground processor AND at least one Sensor are involved?<br /><br />2. Fusing of Intelligence Data with Other Intelligence Data<br />Has contractor successfully fused data among the following five types of intelligence: SI, ELINT, IMINT, GEOINT, MASINT?<br /><br />3. Fusing of OPIR data with Intelligence Data<br />Has contractor successfully fused OPIR data with any the following five intelligence types: SI, ELINT, IMINT, GEOINT, MASINT?<br /><br />4. Fusion Across OPIR Enterprise (Title 10/Title 50)<br />Has contractor successfully fused data among the various OPIR assets?</p>
<p>5. Cross-Domain Sensor Data Fusion<br />Has contractor successfully demonstrated the fusing of data between sensors in the following four domains: Airborne, Land, Sea, Space?<br /><br />6. Cross-Domain Network Integration<br />Has contractor successfully performed network integration between the following four network security domains: SIPRNET, JWICS, NMIS, Other?<br /><br />7. Program Management<br />Has contractor performed Prime Contracting work in the area of data fusion and OPIR on project(s) valued at &gt;$7M over the life of the contract?</p>
<p>Note: See Attachment 1 for E2D2 Definitions <br />See Attachment 2 for Requirements<br />See Attachment 3 for Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) Information</p>
<p><br /><strong>Statement of Capabilities (SO) Submission</strong></p>
<p>The E2D2 Contracting Officer is requesting detailed Statements of Capability (SOC), addressing the technical capabilities in corresponding paragraph format as noted above and information regarding Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) as described in the Attachment 3. Comments, questions and additional information are requested from all interested parties concerning the proposed acquisition. In order for the Government to thoroughly review and analyze the information provided, it is requested that responses be submitted within 15 days after the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Companies may submit a ten page SOC in Word format. In addition, companies may also submit up to 30 PowerPoint slides (in company's standard format is acceptable) The SOC shall contain company information to include point of contact information, company background, and pertinent and specific information addressing relevant technical capabilities addressed in the attached E2D2 Requirements Document. As part of the briefing, interested parties must include a brief description of relevant contract experience offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Include contract number and description, magnitude, and points of contact for each example provided (name of the POC, address, e-mail, telephone number, and fax number).</p>
<p>Submissions may be UNCLASSIFIED or CLASSIFIED (up to TS/SCI) if necessary. UNCLASSIFIED submissions will be submitted electronically to: Russell.shaw@schriever.af.mil. CLASSIFIED SECRET submissions will be submitted to: vonda.fowler@afspc.af.smil.mil. CLASSIFIED TS/SCI submissions will be submitted to: afswfowlv@swc.ic.gov . All classified submissions must comply with the following:</p>
<p>1. Classified Documentation: Shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with applicable National Security policies and guidance documents for Collateral and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) to include: the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22-M), DoD Security Publications, the National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) Security Classification Guide, the NRO security manual, other applicable DCID/IDC Directives, and Executive Orders. National Security policy and guidance documents can be accessed at https://www.dss.mil/GW/ShowBinary/DSS/isp/industrial_sec.html. Classified documents must be properly marked. All information with a classification marking must identify the derivative or original classifier and cite a source on the face of the document. First, the classifier will be identified in the "Classified By:" line, which will include the organization/office symbol, phone number and date. This is a new requirement for derivative classifiers in accordance with CAPCO V4.2 dated 31 May 2011, footnote 1.&nbsp;Next, the classification source or sources will be identified on the "Derived From:" line. These sources will either be pre-existing classified documents from which information has been extracted or copied, or a classification guide or guides, which provide specific written guidance on what elements of information are classified and why. If there is no guide, Respondees/Offerors do not have the authority to classify information based on "best guesses", "hunches" or "experience" (unless they are a designated Government Original Classification Authority, in which case they will be documenting and reporting their classification decisions based on the criteria delineated in EO 13256, which supersedes EO 12958, effective 29 December 2009). The document must also contain a declassification date or 25 year exemption code (or both), again, based on a pre-existing document or classification guide. If any information in the document is classified, all paragraphs must either be marked with the classification of that paragraph, or, if not classified, marked (U) for "UNCLASSIFIED".</p>
<p>If Request for Information is received that does not:<br /><br />&bull; Cite a "Derived From:" source, preferably an existing SCG, PCG, PSD, et al., that is, a Security Classification Guide, Program Classification Guide or Program Security Directive. In the case of "Multiple Sources", the specific sources must be included as an addendum or footnote (this is a changed requirement IAW CAPCO V4.2 dated 31 May 2011, footnote 2);<br /><br />&bull; Include a declassification date (OADR X1-X8, and MR are no longer authorized. 25X1, EO 12951 will be used in lieu of "DCI Only" or "DNI Only", if applicable.. Include a declassification date as indicated by the applicable SCG/PCG/PSD, or, if not is available, a date 25 years from the date of creation of the document being submitted YYYYMMDD format, i.e. "DECL: 20320403"). If conflicting dates arise from using multiple sources, the most restrictive or furthest out date is applied on this line; <br /><br />&bull; Correctly and completely portion mark all paragraphs in the document;<br />It shall be rejected without consideration, as failure to correctly mark a classified document demonstrates that the company submitting the information is ill-prepared to adequately handle and protect classified material. <br /><br />2. Collateral Classified Data: Use classification and marking guidance provided by previously issued security classification guides, the Information Security Regulation (DoD 5200.1-R), when marking and transmitting information previously classified by another original classification authority. Classified information at the CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET level may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Registered Mail, USPS Express Mail, or or approved contract carriers. All classified information will be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers and double wrapped. The inner envelope shall be sealed and plainly marked with the assigned classification and addresses of both the sender and addressee. The inner envelope for classified documents shall be addressed to:</p>
<p>ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes<br />SIDC/PMO, Room #1701 <br />Phone: 719-567-0708</p>
<p><br />The outer envelope for classified documents shall be sealed with no identification as to the classification of its contents and addressed to:</p>
<p>SIDC/PMO<br />ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes <br />24 Talon Way<br />Schriever AFB CO 80912<br /><br />All TOP SECRET, SCI and Communications Security (COMSEC) information and materials should be transmitted through your servicing Special Security Office (SSO) via the Defense Courier Service (DEFCOS) to:</p>
<p>(OUTER WRAPPER):<br />432150 CS00<br />HKC006 DC7 CS 023</p>
<p>This provides an approved secure means of transmission to SSO SCHRIEVER. Inner wrapper must contain classification, and identify intended recipient by organization, rank, name, building/room number and phone number. Since SSO SCHRIEVER serves all SCI-accredited units on Schriever AFB, the inner wrapper provides them with contact information once they receive and open the article. <br /><br />Organizations under existing NRO contracts can also use Management Services and Operations (MS&amp;O) for transmission of SCI to NOPS SCHRIEVER. Again, contact information is required to ensure proper delivery upon receipt. <br /><br />3. For classified submissions: Prior to submission, notify Ms. Lee Ann Backes, leeann.backes@us.af.mil, (719)567-0708, that you will be submitting classified documentation and the method you will use for submission.<br /><br />4. Hand Deliveries: The courier shall deliver the package to the Schriever AFB Visitor Control Center. Couriers must notify the SIDC Security Office in advance in order to have someone meet them at the Visitor Control Center. If they are authorized to enter the base, they can deliver the package directly to the SIDC. The SIDC discourages hand deliveries, preferring electronic submission through JWICS.<br /><br />5. Overnight Delivery of Secret and Confidential Information: Please keep in mind the Government will not reimburse Respondees for any direct costs incurred as a result of submission of any documentation in response to this RFI. Twelve current holders of the General Services Administration carrier contract are approved for overnight domestic express delivery of Secret and Confidential information to and among contractor facilities and U.S. Government Agencies. The Information Security Oversight Office made this policy determination in March 10, 2004 correspondence with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Counterintelligence and Security.

Contractors must establish an approved street address for incorporation by Defense Security Service in the Central Verification Authority (CVA) before such shipments begin. The following requirements apply and must be reflected in the procedures approved by the CSO:<br /><br />1. The carriers listed above may be used for urgent overnight transmissions of SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL material within the continental United States when overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC information, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Foreign Government Information (FGI) may not be transmitted overnight. Please note that Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.<br /><br />2. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified material.<br /><br />3. Material must be prepared for transmission as described in NISPOM paragraph 5-401a, referenced in Section I, paragraph D(1), except that a carrier's mailing envelope may be used as the outer wrapper.<br /><br />4. The outer address label should contain only the office or position/title, of the destination facility, in this case, the "SIDC Security Office."<br /><br />5. A release signature block on the receipt label shall not be executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side) collection boxes is prohibited.<br /><br />6. As a general rule, packages may be shipped on Monday through Thursday only to ensure that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend. However, the CSO may grant local approval to ship material on a Friday provided the receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, and that he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage.<br /><br />7. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.</p>

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for selenium and mercury.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Region's Environmental Office.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit as stated below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratory's QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The Government quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratory's QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the Government will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the Government conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratory's ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the Government may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the Government to assess the laboratory's expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices. Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Environmental Monitoring Branch.  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss the Government's policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratory's QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  
Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval Letter:
The laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the Government's audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratory's audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
System for Award Management (SAM), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

<p style="MARGIN: 6pt -0.7pt 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 42.0pt">Endpoints have become a source of security breaches despite improvements in network security in recent years. This is largely due to the fact that endpoints have become more exposed as users are working increasingly from laptops outside of the office, and the prevalence of web-based applications has brought a greater level of interaction with external sites than ever before. As a consequence, the endpoint has become the weakest link in the enterprise's overall security strategy, and a successful attack at the endpoint may not only reveal the data stored there but also provide the entry point to gain unauthorized access to the rest of the network. In this technology driven age, every organization is now susceptible to the damages caused by malware (ranging from productivity loss to confidential and financial data theft), and endpoints have become the most vulnerable and targeted point of attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Improving endpoint protection has become an essential security measure for the SAA.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt -0.7pt 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 42.0pt">Modern endpoint protection security software provides many features to protect against different attacks, including anti-virus, spyware protection, and a host-based firewall, often with additional optional components such as host-based intrusion detection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Individual products provide specific capabilities, and endpoint protection suites provide an integrated solution including most or all of these endpoint protection features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Workstations are the most common endpoint devices that need to be protected; however, endpoint protection packages may also be used to protect servers, printers, mobile devices, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The SAA is actively seeking solutions providing a full range of endpoint protection features as either an integrated suite or complementary packages, to protect at least laptops, desktop workstations and servers, and optionally mobile computing devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets).</p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">The appraisal shall conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the Code of Professional Ethics and the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal Institute, as well as the guidelines of the U.S. General Services Administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Appraisal Contractor and the lead field appraiser are to be Certified General Real Estate Appraisers for the state your firm is interested below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appraiser Contractor shall not engage a subcontractor for these appraisals.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">The purpose of the appraisal is to determine the Federal Annual Rental (FAR) for the specific property as of the target date of 10/1/2015. The appraiser will need to derive and state the FAR of the appropriate property-for its office space, as well as parking spaces-as of four effective dates: the date of inspection, 10/1/2013, 10/1/2014, and the target date of 10/1/2015. The appraisal must include, at a minimum, three (3) executed comparable leases to non-governmental tenants within the appraisal. Also, the appraisal must include at least three asking inside monthly parking rental comps for the parking appraisal section of the report. At least three inside parking comps must come from within comparable office buildings with indoor unreserved parking. If the market charges a premium for reserved indoor parking spaces, then the appraiser is to show evidence of those rates from 3 additional reserved indoor monthly parking comps.</span></p>

<DESC>Sources Sought

Please note that this is NOT a request for proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS) Research Service is conducting a market survey for well qualified small businesses (in the following socioeconomic categories: Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Hub Zone Small Business, and Small Disadvantage Businesses (8(a)) capable of providing a wireless, pressure sensitive, bed monitoring system.

Description of the Requirement:
The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS) Research Service is requiring vendor to provide a wireless bed monitoring system that has the following capabilities/working characteristics: 

1) disposable or able to be sterilized 30 inch X 60 inch pressure sensitive bed mattress overlays, each one of which has 200 pressure sensors laid out in a 10 X 20 grid matrix (as shown in Figure 1) and that connects wirelessly to a monitoring station up to 100 yards away; and, 
2) a monitoring station that can connect wirelessly to multiple bed pressure pads and that has built in software capable of interpreting the signals from each bed unit and displaying the results graphically by bed to indicate the amount of time (e.g., percentage of time each shift or each 24 hour day) that a patient is 
(a) sitting on the bed; 
(b) laying on the bed; or, 
(c) either sitting or laying on the bed, and can flag when there is constant pressure in one spot for more than a constant period of time (e.g., one hour) indicating that a patient is not moving sufficiently to avoid pressure ulcers.  

Figures 1: Pressure sensitive bed monitoring system


















The vendor will need to work closely with the clinical team in order to test and debug each prototype to ensure that the system is appropriately designed and that the software is optimally written to achieve program objectives.  The pressure sensitive bed mattress overlays need to be designed to eventually be mass produced, need to be very light weight, thin, durable, and require very low amp/voltage to operate.  This could include some type of matt with imprinted circuitry that includes an array of multiple Piezoelectric pressure sensors.

The solicitation is expected to be available prior to 07/30/2013.  Contract award is anticipated for NLT 09/30/2013.

The North American Industry Classification System Code for this solicitation is 339112 with the size standard of 500 employees.   Responders should identify if they are a small business or small disadvantaged business concern, based on this NAICS code. SDVOSB and VOSB businesses will receive first consideration.

Please submit expressions of interest in your own format to include documentation of technical capabilities and past performance for the same or similar services previously or currently performed.  Provide in detail to the Government that your company possesses the necessary expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Please ensure responses do not exceed ten (10) pages. Since this is a Sources Sought Announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.

<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-13-T-0007, Sole Source Acquisition to Establish Preventive Maintenance Agreement for Vindicator/VICADS Security System<br /><br />The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Open Roads Consulting, Inc (ORCI). Requirement is to establish a Preventive Maintenance Agreement for maintenance and repairs for the Vindicator/VICADS Security System at Seymour Johnson AFB. The reason for this sole source is to prevent a lapse in coverage. After the completion of this bridge a follow on contract will be competed. <br /><br />This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 8 March 2013 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 12 March 2013. For information regarding this purchase, please contact 1Lt Aaron Velasco at (919) 722-1674 or TSgt Ian Buschmann at (919) 722-1753.
<p>APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award a contract for six (6) months to secure the safety and protection of SJAFB's personnel and assets utilizing ORCI. ORCI is currently performing the services under contract number FA4809-07-M-R017. The contract is currently in the six-month extension period and was extended from its original expiration date of 16 Sep 2012 to 16 Mar 2013 as the Government anticipated the services on SJAFB to be satisfied by an Air Force-wide contract awarded in June 2012; however, terminated shortly thereafter. The need for Vindicator/VICADS/CCTV with Object Video Security System maintenance via a contract still exists. Currently, ORCI is the only firm that has access to SJAFB's secured network and required certifications to work the on-site equipment already in place, to perform mission critical services, without generating a lapse in service. Awarding a competitive contract for six (6) months to another contractor would result in a substantial duplication of mobilization costs, equipment costs, and other start-up costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition due the excessively short period of performance that any other firm would have to amortize these costs over. Also, permitting base network access to a company for a limited scheduled service potentially comprises operational security (OPSEC) and information security (INFOSEC). ORCI is the only firm that can perform without a mobilization/start-up period which would result in delays or no preventive or corrective maintenance services for SJAFB. The Government does not have the personnel, materials or equipment that would be required to perform this service. The lack of maintenance and repair services to SJAFB's security system would place installation personnel, critical equipment and infrastructure at an unacceptable risk. A bridge contract will ensure the paramount continuation of service and provide the four to six month lead-time to process a competitive acquisition for a follow on contract.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell office, janitorial, and other products to the offices included at the Clay Army National Guard Center (Clay ANGC) in Marietta, GA. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of a Base Supply Center at the Clay ANGC.</p>
<p>National Industries for the Blind (NIB), an AbilityOne Program designated central nonprofit agency (CNA), is currently in discussions with officials at the Clay ANGC to establish a Base Supply Center (BSC).  BSCs are retail stores on military installations and in Federal office buildings that sell a wide range of office, janitorial, and other products primarily to meet the same-day shopping needs of Government customers.</p>
<p>The Commission approves the addition of BSCs to its PL primarily as outlets for the sale of AbilityOne products.  The sale of AbilityOne products to Government customers is one of the ways that the Commission accomplishes its mission of creating employment opportunities for people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities.  The Commission also allows the sale of a wide variety of non-AbilityOne products referred to as convenience items in the BSC to make each store a same day, one-stop shopping option for Government customers.  The Government purchase card (GPC) is the primary means of payment for products purchased in BSCs.   Use of the BSC by the Clay ANGC customers is not mandatory.  It is simply another shopping option for your GPC holders.</p>
<p>Typically, BSCs carry a full range of office, janitorial, and sanitation supplies and almost any other product being legitimately sought for purchase by the GPC holder.</p>
<p>The addition of a BSC to the Commission's PL follows a deliberative process.  Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 51-2.4 requires that the Commission consider the level of impact on the total sales of commercial firms from whom Government purchasers are currently buying the same or similar products being proposed for sale in the BSC.  Although sales in the retail environment are not guaranteed to any firm, it is possible that the level of business being done with local small businesses in (BSC Site) area will be diverted to the BSC as GPC holders opt to shop at the on-installation BSC.  The kinds of firms that could be affected might include any businesses that sell office, janitorial, sanitation, and hardware supplies to GPC holders.</p>
<p>Should these this center be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to enter into a no-cost contract for operation of the BSC at the Clay ANGC will be the Department of the Army - W7M3 USPFO Activity GA ARNG.<br /> <br />If your firm is currently selling office, janitorial, or other BSC-type products to offices at the Clay ANGC it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the office, janitorial, or BSC-type products to offices at the Clay ANGC for the same most recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to offices at the Clay ANGC.</p>
<p>6.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>7.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>8.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 8, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		4235-01-572-3902<br />Name:		Sorbent, Hazardous Material, Granular, Biobased, 4 LB<br />Description:	Biobased, hazardous material sweeping compound that absorbs a wide range of oils, fuels, anti-freeze, etc. Sorbent contains micro-organisms that bioremediate hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water. Bio-based granules encapsulate spills on contact. Approximately, 4 pounds of sorbent will absorb OVER ONE GALLON AND A PINT OF OIL, OVER A GALLON OF ANTI-FREEZE AND ALMOST A GALLON OF DIESEL FUEL. Sorbent also absorbs other liquids. The sorbent is biobased- USDA Biopreferred 97%. UOI is BX. BX = (12) 4 LB boxes.</p>
<p>NSN:		4235-01-572-3892<br />Name:		Sorbent, Hazardous Material, Granular, Biobased, 20 LB<br />Description:	Biobased, hazardous material sweeping compound that absorbs a wide range of oils, fuels, anti-freeze, etc. Sorbent contains micro-organisms that bioremediate hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water. Bio-based granules encapsulate spills on contact. Approximately, 6.8 pounds of sorbent will absorb 2 gallons of oil, 7.5 pounds will absorb 2 gallons of anti-freeze and 8.4 pounds will absorb 2 gallons of diesel. Sorbent also absorbs other liquids. The sorbent is biobased- USDA Biopreferred 97%. UOI is BG. BG = (1) 20 LB bag.</p>
<p>NSN:		4235-01-599-3952<br />Name:		Sorbent, Hazardous Material, Granular, Biobased, 40 LB<br />Description:	Biobased, hazardous material sweeping compound that absorbs a wide range of oils, fuels, anti-freeze, etc. Sorbent contains micro-organisms that bioremediate hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			4235-01-572-3902<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	GS-4, LCI406038</p>
<p>NSN:			4235-01-572-3892<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	G3725982; 09473893/G2030903; 662706-00121; 09473901</p>

<CONTACT>Andy Fox

<a href="mailto:Andy_Fox@nps.gov">Andy_Fox@nps.gov</a>
<DESC>Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action / Sources Sought Announcement / Sole Source Notice The NPS anticipates soliciting a proposal from a single source, Gallatin County Montana for composting services; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NPS. The NPS anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 3/25/2013 and awarding a contract by April 1, 2013. Copies of the solicitation may be obtained by submitting a request to andy_fox@nps.gov or fax 307-344-2079 by 3/29/2013. A)	Statement of Work:   The contract will include composting of YNP municipal solid waste and manure. The NPS has determined that due to transportation costs and environmental issues the composting facility should be located no more than 150 miles (one-way distance) from YNPs headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, WY. The contract will not include the handling or transport of any hazardous materials. YNP personnel will transport the waste to the compost facility, year round, in 75 yard compactor trailers as well as collection trucks directly without using compactor trailers. The number of loads will vary, depending on the time of the year. During the summer months, up to 36 tons per day will be delivered. During the winter months, one 18 ton load will be delivered every seven to ten days. The contractor shall sort the municipal solid waste at the compost facility, separating compostable waste from non-compostable waste. Compostable waste is defined as all organic materials that meets or exceeds the specifications set forth by industry standards. The contractor shall process all compostable municipal solid waste with sewage sludge and manure into compost. The contractor shall store the processed compost in a climate controlled environment. The composting process must divert 85%, by weight, of the municipal solid waste from a land fill. The contractor shall dispose of all non-compostable solid waste at a licensed landfill. The contractor shall have their facility registered with the state and shall adhere to all federal and state solid waste regulations. B)	Estimated Quantities:     2,500 tons of municipal solid waste and 325 tons of manure C)	Anticipated Period of Performance:  4/1/2013  9/30/2017 D)	Proposed Contract Type:  Firm fixed price contract with unit pricing. E)	Sole source justification, evaluation factors or contractor qualifications: The National Park Service has determined that disposal of waste within the park boundaries of Yellowstone National Park is not appropriate and that long distance transporting of the waste is neither practical nor environmentally appropriate. Analysis of the issue revealed that a significant amount of the waste was comprised of paper and food products.  Based upon the make-up of the waste it was determined that composting of the waste just outside of the Park provided the best means by which to address both the environmental and cost issues of disposing of the waste. The composting process would address the environmental issues surrounding waste disposal by diverting the majority of the waste from the landfill and providing a reusable byproduct. And by composting of the waste just outside of the Parks border YNPs waste disposal costs would be reduced due to the transportation costs. Thus, in 2001 the National Park Service (NPS) and several municipalities in southwest Montana began the process of planning, designing and constructing the Gallatin County composting facility in West Yellowstone, a community just outside of YNPs west entrance. In 2008 Congress recognized the significant importance of the Gallatin County composting facility to the operation of Yellowstone National Park and granted the National Park Service (NPS) authority to pay a significant portion of the cost to upgrade the composting facility for the specific purpose of processing and disposal of waste generated within Yellowstone National Park. Congress went on to elaborate on the continued use of the Gallatin County composting facility by the NPS given the capital contribution made by the NPS.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL - Not Required</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL - Not Required</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.</p>
<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL - Not Required</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>
<p>(xi) Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addenda:<br />(i)(3) "Payment" is tailored as follows: IAW FAR Clause 52.232-36(f), Contractor shall submit invoices for certification to the address identified in G-2 of this CSA. After certification, the office identified in G-2 shall provide the Contractor with GPC information for billing. Payment will be made to the Contractor through a charge to the GPC, at the time and for the amount due in accordance with the certified invoice.<br />(u) "Reporting of Funds" is added as follows: This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds.

<p>(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph ii above.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) "Work Orders" is added as follows: Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form).

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction applies only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

This workstation will help our studies since exposure of rodent PHEO cells to hypoxia is crucial to elucidate mechanisms leading to tumor formation and growth and those responsible for resistance of these tumors to current therapies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no human PHEO cell line available, incubation of the primary PHEO cell cultures from patient&rsquo; samples collected here in conditions resembling in vivo oxygen levels might help to establish the stable cell line.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br />Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory<br />Statement of Work Repair of Laboratory Exhaust Fans<br />1.	Introduction</p>
<p>The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, located on Virginia Key, Florida is a research facility owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The main building was commissioned in 1973 and consists of roughly 78,000 square feet of office, laboratory, workshop, machinery, and storage space.</p>
<p>2.	Scope</p>
<p>2.1	General<br />NOAA is seeking a vendor capable of performing repairs to certain components of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Virginia Key, FL.  The scope of work consists of, but is not strictly limited to, the furnishing of all labor and materials required to repair, and extend the service life of, four laboratory exhaust fans.</p>
<p>2.2	Background<br />Numerous laboratory spaces within AOML are served by fume hoods, which in turn vent to a redundant laboratory exhaust fan system (i.e. two fans each at two separate locations) on the 4th floor roof of the main building.  These exhaust fans are operated on an alternating schedule, i.e. one fan is continuously operating at each location for about one month at a time.  Since their installation about 10 years ago, these fans have been continuously exposed to both harsh chemical fumes and a tropical, coastal environment that includes constant inundation with salt air and sunlight.  The fans have corroded significantly since their installation and are in need of repair to extend their service life by approximately 2-3 years, until new fans can be budgeted and procured.  Additionally, one fan requires repair of moving parts.</p>
<p>2.3	 Work Items<br />2.3.1	Replace the wind bands on two fans:<br />2.3.1.1	Procure two (2) replacement wind bands for fans EF-9B and EF-15B.  See Section 3.3 for information about the existing wind bands.<br />2.3.1.2	Remove the existing wind bands from the fan housings on exhaust fans EF-9B and EF-15B.  Dispose of these wind bands as directed by the AOML Associate Director (ADIR).<br />2.3.1.3	Prepare the surface of both fan housings such that the new wind bands can be bolted (via four attachment points) in a structurally sound manner.  This will require rotating the four attachment points from areas of corroded metal on the fan housings to areas of solid metal.<br />2.3.1.4	Bolt the two new wind bands to the EF-9B and EF-15B housings.<br />2.3.1.5	Treat and preserve the entirety of both fan housings per the procedure specified in section 2.5.<br />2.3.2	Remove, replace, test, and certify the following components for exhaust fan EF-15A:<br />2.3.2.1	Motor and blower wheel pulleys<br />2.3.2.2	Bearings on blower wheel shaft<br />2.3.2.3	Belt and bushings<br />2.3.3	Replacement components shall be new equipment only.  There shall be no reconditioned or "gray market" items. All equipment shall have the same specifications as the existing and shall be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>2.4	 Optional Item<br />2.4.1	The optional item involves metal repairs on the four (4) modular, double-walled Bypass Air Plenums (BAP) of exhaust fans EF-9A, EF-9B, EF-15A, and EF-15B.  Each BAP is in different condition and requires different repairs.<br />2.4.2	Treat and preserve corroded metal surfaces of each BAP per section 2.5.1 through 2.5.3.<br />2.4.3	Repair areas of metal wasting (including plenum skirts) and rust-through corrosion such that each BAP is structurally sound and sufficiently sealed to function effectively as an air plenum.  These repairs can be made through any combination of sheet metal, metal compound, and/or fiberglass patching.  If sheet metal patching is used, the metal shall be corrosion resistant steel of similar gauge.<br />2.4.4	Paint all surfaces per section 2.5.4-2.5.5.</p>
<p>2.5	 Metal treatment and preservation - minimum acceptable procedure<br />2.5.1	Remove all large rust and scale particles with a chipping hammer, scaling tool, wire brush, and/or sandpaper.<br />2.5.2	Clean and degrease all rusted surfaces with acetone, and let dry.<br />2.5.3	Apply two (2) coats of Skyco Ospho rust converter to all rusted surfaces with a brush.  Allow each coat to dry for a minimum of 24 hours. <br />2.5.4	Apply one (1) coat of Devoe Bar Rust 235 primer, oxide red color, to all treated and repaired surfaces.  Let dry for a minimum of 8 hours.<br />2.5.5	Apply one topcoat of Devoe 379 to all primed surfaces, with color to approximately match existing top color.</p>
<p>2.6	Period of Performance<br />This work shall be completed before June 1, 2013.</p>
<p>2.7	Site Familiarization<br />A pre-bid site visit is not required but is strongly recommended due to the variety of repairs required. Available photographs are included as a separate attachment.  Photos were taken after a recent rust converter spray treatment.<br /> <br />2.8	 Standards and Certifications<br />2.8.1	All work performed under this contract shall be in accordance with ANSI/ASSE Standard Z9.5-2012, Laboratory Ventilation.<br />2.8.2	All work shall be warrantied for a period of 90 days.</p>

The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition test program procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66. This is an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(a)(2). This is a competitive LPTA best value source selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offerors shall be treated equally except for prices. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award for this effort. Failure to meet a requirement will result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. For the purpose of award, the Government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br /><br />To be technically acceptable each item must match the National Stock Number (NSN) and Part Number (P/N) to the items listed in the attached schedule; manufactured new and traceable to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means the awardee must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor. Reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 Cost/Price</p>
<p>The Government may select the source based upon the lowest price meeting the technical requirements. Past performance shall be viewed as a responsibility determination. In the event two or more technically acceptable offerors bid an identical total price, the Contracting Officer may evaluate responsibility of the contractor by seeking relevant performance information through sources such AMMIS inventory system at the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center and records posted on Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), or other government data bases and other sources that are available. If an offeror has limited or no record of relevant past performance, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably but rather receive a neutral rating.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The award will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The USCG intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract to the aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) EADS CASA NA, 1616 North Myer Drive, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3110 (Cage 0DAF1) or an OEM distributor that can provide traceability.

<p><br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</span></span></p>

<p>Telephone: 55-85-3101-6618<br />Fax: 55-85-3101-6601</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance on the proposed Cear&aacute; State Digital Backbone Network Business and Governance Model ("Project") in Brazil ("Host Country").  The Technical Assistance will further refine the public-private business model of the digital backbone network and will evaluate options for re-structuring its management and governance body.</p>
<p>At the state government level in Cear&aacute;, ICT policy and deployment are managed by the Information Technology Company of Cear&aacute; (Empresa de Tecnologia da Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o do Cear&aacute; - ETICE), an autonomous public company linked to the Cear&aacute; State Planning and Management Secretariat.  ETICE provides public ICT services to the state.  The company utilizes its own assets, and benefits from administrative, financial and technical autonomy in its activities.  In 2007, the State of Cear&aacute; expanded broadband capability into what is known locally as the Cintur&atilde;o Digital, a state-wide digital backbone network that is considered Cear&aacute;'s highest profile ICT initiative.  ETICE has requested this technical assistance from USTDA to further refine the public-private business model of the digital background network and to evaluate options for re-structuring its management and governance body.</p>
<p>The objective of the new model is to reflect the multiple stakeholder interests in management and governance of the network, and to ensure that the network will continue to stimulate the ICT sector across multiple industry segments and secure the benefits of robust ICT support for delivery of public services.  The Technical Assistance will provide an overview and comparison of potential models, review regulatory requirements for ICT partnerships, conduct outreach to relevant stakeholders and make recommendations for the structure of this governing body.  Different models to be examined may include a public-private partnership or consortium.  This structure will reflect ETICE's central concern for establishing a form of permanent representation of the interests of both large and small firms, from operators to potential start-up innovators.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $171,706 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br />https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp<br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1:00 PM Local (Bras&iacute;lia), April 23, 2013</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Within OFDA, the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement (HPGE) Team serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement with UN agencies and other public international organizations, and other donor governments. The HPGE Team tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field and engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies.  It also recommends strategies for action, initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization, and maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors.  The HPGE team leads OFDA's communications work and serves as the primary interlocutor with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues. The HPGE Team is directed by a Humanitarian Coordination Specialist and is supported by Team Leaders, Humanitarian Advisors, an Operations Support Coordinator, and also has staff members focused on program development, policy and outreach, strategic communications, and interagency engagement. The HPGE Team has Senior Humanitarian Advisors located in Rome, Geneva, and Brussels and a Humanitarian Advisor located in New York and Washington.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) in Geneva is part of the HPGE Team's global policy staff.</p>
<p>Currently, OFDA has one program staff member and one support staff in the Office of Refugees and Migration Affairs (RMA) section of the U.S. Mission in Geneva; these staff members work closely with United Nations (UN) agencies, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)/International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), nongovernmental organization (NGO) fora, and donors on a range of humanitarian issues.  As one of the critical "humanitarian capitals of the world," Geneva is the venue for key discussions on policy issues directly related to OFDA's activities, such as reform of the international humanitarian system, best practices in financing humanitarian programs and disaster management as well as for donor initiatives on improving the effectiveness of humanitarian aid.  The U.S. Government (USG) is seen within the Geneva-based international community as a leader in the field of humanitarian affairs based on its expertise in policy and delivery of assistance, an extensive field network, large humanitarian budget, and its engagement with a wide variety of international and local partners.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based at the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) in Geneva, Switzerland to provide support to USUN and ensure that USAID objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting on humanitarian issues, and situational analysis on humanitarian policy issues are met and coordinated closely.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Senior Humanitarian Advisor serves as a key source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Geneva.  The SHA will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN offices in Geneva, and anticipate and prepare documents and briefing memos on humanitarian issues for important meetings and events.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will also raise critical issues with the UN on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and must have the ability to multi-task.  The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support on humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Senior Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive experience with and a thorough understanding of the international humanitarian assistance environment, operations, related policies, regulations, and inter-relationships between the USG, donors and other international organizations.</p>
<p>The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is part of the USAID/OFDA Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team, as well as part of the U.S. Mission Geneva Humanitarian Policy Team. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will work out of the USUN Mission in Geneva, Switzerland and will report to the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement team in USAID/OFDA/Washington and to the USUN Geneva Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), through the RMA Counselor, as well as meet regularly with the DCM in Geneva. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as USAID's principal in-country point of contact for humanitarian issues in Geneva.  The SHA's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis.<br />&bull;	Represent USAID at donor meetings covering a broad range of humanitarian issues and provide DCHA Bureau with analysis and guidance on relations with the UN system.<br />&bull;	As part of an interagency team working on humanitarian issues in the Office of Refugees and Migration Affairs (RMA) Section at USUN Geneva, interact with State Department colleagues on developing strategies and policies toward UN agencies and issues.<br />&bull;	Anticipate the needs at USUN Geneva regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings as required.<br />&bull;	Attend various UN, USUN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), Humanitarian Liaison Working Group (HLWG) and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate humanitarian policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues.<br />&bull;	Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other diplomatic missions in order to promote humanitarian principles and coordinate disaster response activities.<br />&bull;	Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other USUN components and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of humanitarian affairs. Typical contacts are the Chief of Mission, high level officials of the UN agencies and senior representatives of foreign governments.  The incumbent will influence policy.<br />&bull;	Represent DCHA on specific humanitarian issues of concern with UN agencies in Geneva and convey demarche messages as needed.<br />&bull;	Represent USAID at meetings with the UN, international organizations, and other donors and other conferences sponsored by members of the international community, and provide guidance and advice on USG positions, negotiate strategies, and, in consultation with USAID/Washington, conduct negotiations with the donor community and make recommendations to the appropriate officials in USAID.<br />&bull;	Work with counterparts in other donor organizations in Geneva at the most senior levels, particularly those represented in the Humanitarian Liaison Working Group, to exchange information, establish meetings on specific donor issues, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities; coordinate these activities with relevant USAID officers.<br />&bull;	Disseminate relevant USAID/OFDA guidelines and information and act as OFDA's general point of contact for international donor appeals and other documentation from agencies based in Geneva.  Respond to inquiries and be familiar with their operational procedures.<br />&bull;	Advise USAID/OFDA staff on issues regarding donations and requests for USG support and information sharing from private and public interest groups, including those formed on an ad hoc basis during disaster assistance operations.<br />&bull;	Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and represent USAID in field visits and assessments as appropriate and when requested by USAID/OFDA.<br />&bull;	Act as Mission Geneva and OFDA liaison to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on food security and maternal child health nutrition issues for emergency, non-emergency and developmental relief activities.<br />&bull;	Provide informational updates and analysis as necessary on activities undertaken by ICRC, WHO, OCHA, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on issues which have a humanitarian focus that will drive policy debates in the USG interagency arena.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor at USUN is part of the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team as well as part of the U.S. Mission Geneva Humanitarian Policy Team. The SHA will report to USAID/OFDA/Washington's Humanitarian Coordination Specialist or his/her designee as part of the Policy Team and to the USUN Geneva DCM, through the RMA Counselor. The SHA will meet regularly with the DCM.  The SHA does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS<br />Supervisory controls will concurrently be through USAID/Washington and the USUN Mission, but the Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen and Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Sana'a Yemen as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Yemen country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Yemen will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future USAID presence in Yemen. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition process in Yemen. In close coordination with the Embassy and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for the Yemen and Asia Team, the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Yemen and Asia, or his/her designee, as well as to the Yemen Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Yemen program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, is conducting market research in order to capture market capabilities with respect to the E2D2 requirements as listed below. This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All large and small businesses capable of providing these services are encouraged to respond. Respondents to this notice should indicate whether they qualify as a large or small business under NAICS Code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services - size standard $7.0M.

<p><strong>Service Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>The Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) is the innovation arm of Air Force Space Command. The mission of the SIDC is to advance warfighter success through innovation and integration of capability. One of the focus areas within the SIDC is the research and development of data fusion techniques for OPIR as well as other sensor data. OPIR provides the capability to identify sources of infrared signatures anywhere on the globe. This capability is critical to our national security. In addition, previous R&amp;D efforts have proven that fusion of OPIR data with other available data can provide a more defined and accurate operational picture. The deployment of existing and more capable space sensors has also contributed to the need to further explore the fusing of data to improve our ability to identify objects. Performance under this effort will include annual O&amp;M work to integrate existing technologies and efforts for the exploration and presentation of approaches in a research and development environment for collecting, processing and exploiting end-to end development OPIR ground stations and sensors with various existing OPIR assets.</p>
<p>The approach to E2D2 requirements follows a logical flow to the Tasking, Collecting, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) model. The contractor will be required to demonstrate the end-to-end process starting with collecting all the way through to possible dissemination. Following this model, the first step is Tasking. Although the contractor is not required to demonstrate "tasking" events, he/she will be required to know and understand all OPIR assets, and know which taskings belong to which assets. The second step in the model is Collecting. The contractor shall collect existing data from OPIR and intelligence assets. In the third step, Processing, the contractor will be required to process new data sources while applying innovative processing techniques. The fourth step is exploitation of the collected and processed data, the contractor may be required to recommend changes to Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) all the way up to performing actual algorithm development. In the fifth step, Dissemination, the contractor may be required to present approaches for disseminating the new capability via an operational picture or by other means selected by the government. (See attachment 2)</p>
<p>The contractor must, from an overarching perspective, be able to explore and present the following approaches in an R&amp;D environment using the aforementioned logical flow model from end-to-end.</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall explore and present approaches in a research and development environment for collecting data from OPIR ground stations and sensors as well as other select assets for processing.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall demonstrate the processing of data to obtain new and innovative ways of improving what data/information can be provided for battlespace awareness.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall exploit and potentially disseminate data after collecting and processing data to provide enhanced battlespace awareness.<br /><br />4. The contractor shall apply best business practices and a sound program management approach to all efforts placed on contract.</p>
<p>In addition, the government has identified seven performance areas that respondents should demonstrate capability performing. (The areas are not listed in any specific order of importance).</p>
<p>1. Tasking, Collecting, Processing, Exploiting and Disseminating (TCPED) System End-to-End<br /><br />Has contractor successfully performed TCPED end-to-end development among OPIR assets and other assets where at least one Ground processor AND at least one Sensor are involved?<br /><br />2. Fusing of Intelligence Data with Other Intelligence Data<br />Has contractor successfully fused data among the following five types of intelligence: SI, ELINT, IMINT, GEOINT, MASINT?<br /><br />3. Fusing of OPIR data with Intelligence Data<br />Has contractor successfully fused OPIR data with any the following five intelligence types: SI, ELINT, IMINT, GEOINT, MASINT?<br /><br />4. Fusion Across OPIR Enterprise (Title 10/Title 50)<br />Has contractor successfully fused data among the various OPIR assets?</p>
<p>5. Cross-Domain Sensor Data Fusion<br />Has contractor successfully demonstrated the fusing of data between sensors in the following four domains: Airborne, Land, Sea, Space?<br /><br />6. Cross-Domain Network Integration<br />Has contractor successfully performed network integration between the following four network security domains: SIPRNET, JWICS, NMIS, Other?<br /><br />7. Program Management<br />Has contractor performed Prime Contracting work in the area of data fusion and OPIR on project(s) valued at &gt;$7M over the life of the contract?</p>
<p>Note: See Attachment 1 for E2D2 Definitions <br />See Attachment 2 for Requirements<br />See Attachment 3 for Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) Information</p>
<p><br /><strong>Statement of Capabilities (SO) Submission</strong></p>
<p>The E2D2 Contracting Officer is requesting detailed Statements of Capability (SOC), addressing the technical capabilities in corresponding paragraph format as noted above and information regarding Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) as described in the Attachment 3. Comments, questions and additional information are requested from all interested parties concerning the proposed acquisition. In order for the Government to thoroughly review and analyze the information provided, it is requested that responses be submitted within 15 days after the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Companies may submit a ten page SOC <em><strong>(total includes cover sheet, index, and/or table of contents)</strong></em> in Word format. In addition, companies may also submit up to 30 PowerPoint slides (in company's standard format is acceptable) The SOC shall contain company information to include point of contact information, company background, and pertinent and specific information addressing relevant technical capabilities addressed in the attached E2D2 Requirements Document. As part of the briefing, interested parties must include a brief description of relevant contract experience offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Include contract number and description, magnitude, and points of contact for each example provided (name of the POC, address, e-mail, telephone number, and fax number).</p>
<p>Submissions may be UNCLASSIFIED or CLASSIFIED (up to TS/SCI) if necessary. UNCLASSIFIED submissions will be submitted electronically to: Russell.shaw@schriever.af.mil. CLASSIFIED SECRET submissions will be submitted to: vonda.fowler@afspc.af.smil.mil. CLASSIFIED TS/SCI submissions will be submitted to: afswfowlv@swc.ic.gov . All classified submissions must comply with the following:</p>
<p>1. Classified Documentation: Shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with applicable National Security policies and guidance documents for Collateral and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) to include: the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22-M), DoD Security Publications, the National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) Security Classification Guide, the NRO security manual, other applicable DCID/IDC Directives, and Executive Orders. National Security policy and guidance documents can be accessed at https://www.dss.mil/GW/ShowBinary/DSS/isp/industrial_sec.html. Classified documents must be properly marked. All information with a classification marking must identify the derivative or original classifier and cite a source on the face of the document. First, the classifier will be identified in the "Classified By:" line, which will include the organization/office symbol, phone number and date. This is a new requirement for derivative classifiers in accordance with CAPCO V4.2 dated 31 May 2011, footnote 1.&nbsp;Next, the classification source or sources will be identified on the "Derived From:" line. These sources will either be pre-existing classified documents from which information has been extracted or copied, or a classification guide or guides, which provide specific written guidance on what elements of information are classified and why. If there is no guide, Respondees/Offerors do not have the authority to classify information based on "best guesses", "hunches" or "experience" (unless they are a designated Government Original Classification Authority, in which case they will be documenting and reporting their classification decisions based on the criteria delineated in EO 13256, which supersedes EO 12958, effective 29 December 2009). The document must also contain a declassification date or 25 year exemption code (or both), again, based on a pre-existing document or classification guide. If any information in the document is classified, all paragraphs must either be marked with the classification of that paragraph, or, if not classified, marked (U) for "UNCLASSIFIED".</p>
<p>If Request for Information is received that does not:<br /><br />&bull; Cite a "Derived From:" source, preferably an existing SCG, PCG, PSD, et al., that is, a Security Classification Guide, Program Classification Guide or Program Security Directive. In the case of "Multiple Sources", the specific sources must be included as an addendum or footnote (this is a changed requirement IAW CAPCO V4.2 dated 31 May 2011, footnote 2);<br /><br />&bull; Include a declassification date (OADR X1-X8, and MR are no longer authorized. 25X1, EO 12951 will be used in lieu of "DCI Only" or "DNI Only", if applicable.. Include a declassification date as indicated by the applicable SCG/PCG/PSD, or, if not is available, a date 25 years from the date of creation of the document being submitted YYYYMMDD format, i.e. "DECL: 20320403"). If conflicting dates arise from using multiple sources, the most restrictive or furthest out date is applied on this line; <br /><br />&bull; Correctly and completely portion mark all paragraphs in the document;<br />It shall be rejected without consideration, as failure to correctly mark a classified document demonstrates that the company submitting the information is ill-prepared to adequately handle and protect classified material. <br /><br />2. Collateral Classified Data: Use classification and marking guidance provided by previously issued security classification guides, the Information Security Regulation (DoD 5200.1-R), when marking and transmitting information previously classified by another original classification authority. Classified information at the CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET level may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Registered Mail, USPS Express Mail, or or approved contract carriers. All classified information will be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers and double wrapped. The inner envelope shall be sealed and plainly marked with the assigned classification and addresses of both the sender and addressee. The inner envelope for classified documents shall be addressed to:</p>
<p>ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes<br />SIDC/PMO, Room #1701 <br />Phone: 719-567-0708</p>
<p><br />The outer envelope for classified documents shall be sealed with no identification as to the classification of its contents and addressed to:</p>
<p>SIDC/PMO<br />ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes <br />24 Talon Way<br />Schriever AFB CO 80912<br /><br />All TOP SECRET, SCI and Communications Security (COMSEC) information and materials should be transmitted through your servicing Special Security Office (SSO) via the Defense Courier Service (DEFCOS) to:</p>
<p>(OUTER WRAPPER):<br />432150 CS00<br />HKC006 DC7 CS 023</p>
<p>This provides an approved secure means of transmission to SSO SCHRIEVER. Inner wrapper must contain classification, and identify intended recipient by organization, rank, name, building/room number and phone number. Since SSO SCHRIEVER serves all SCI-accredited units on Schriever AFB, the inner wrapper provides them with contact information once they receive and open the article. <br /><br />Organizations under existing NRO contracts can also use Management Services and Operations (MS&amp;O) for transmission of SCI to NOPS SCHRIEVER. Again, contact information is required to ensure proper delivery upon receipt. <br /><br />3. For classified submissions: Prior to submission, notify Ms. Lee Ann Backes, leeann.backes@us.af.mil, (719)567-0708, that you will be submitting classified documentation and the method you will use for submission.<br /><br />4. Hand Deliveries: The courier shall deliver the package to the Schriever AFB Visitor Control Center. Couriers must notify the SIDC Security Office in advance in order to have someone meet them at the Visitor Control Center. If they are authorized to enter the base, they can deliver the package directly to the SIDC. The SIDC discourages hand deliveries, preferring electronic submission through JWICS.<br /><br />5. Overnight Delivery of Secret and Confidential Information: Please keep in mind the Government will not reimburse Respondees for any direct costs incurred as a result of submission of any documentation in response to this RFI. Twelve current holders of the General Services Administration carrier contract are approved for overnight domestic express delivery of Secret and Confidential information to and among contractor facilities and U.S. Government Agencies. The Information Security Oversight Office made this policy determination in March 10, 2004 correspondence with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Counterintelligence and Security. Additional information can be viewed at http://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs/classified-transmission.html:</p>
<p>Air Freight Plus, Inc.<br />AirNet Systems, Inc.<br />Associated Global Systems, Inc.<br />Astar USA, LLC<br />CorTrans Logistics, LLC<br />D.C. Dyna, Inc.(DBA: Cavalier Logistics)<br />Federal Express Corporation<br />Panther II Transportation, Inc.<br />Q International Courier, Inc.<br />Team Air Express, Inc.<br />United Parcel Service, Inc. (OH)<br />United States Postal Service. <br /><br />(Before mailing classified information, please check the URL provided above for the current approved contract carriers, as this list changes every fiscal year).<br /><br />As a reminder, Facility Security Officers must establish procedures to assure the proper protection of classified packages at each facility intending to use overnight service. These procedures must be formally approved by the Cognizant Security Office (CSO). Contractors must establish an approved street address for incorporation by Defense Security Service in the Central Verification Authority (CVA) before such shipments begin. The following requirements apply and must be reflected in the procedures approved by the CSO:<br /><br />1. The carriers listed above may be used for urgent overnight transmissions of SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL material within the continental United States when overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC information, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Foreign Government Information (FGI) may not be transmitted overnight. Please note that Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.<br /><br />2. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified material.<br /><br />3. Material must be prepared for transmission as described in NISPOM paragraph 5-401a, referenced in Section I, paragraph D(1), except that a carrier's mailing envelope may be used as the outer wrapper.<br /><br />4. The outer address label should contain only the office or position/title, of the destination facility, in this case, the "SIDC Security Office."<br /><br />5. A release signature block on the receipt label shall not be executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side) collection boxes is prohibited.<br /><br />6. As a general rule, packages may be shipped on Monday through Thursday only to ensure that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend. However, the CSO may grant local approval to ship material on a Friday provided the receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, and that he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage.<br /><br />7. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.</p>

Collateral Classified Data: Use classification and marking guidance provided by previously issued security classification guides, the Information Security Regulation (DoD 5200.1-R), when marking and transmitting information previously classified by another original classification authority. Classified information at the CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET level may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Registered Mail, USPS Express Mail, or or approved contract carriers. All classified information will be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers and double wrapped. The inner envelope shall be sealed and plainly marked with the assigned classification and addresses of both the sender and addressee. The inner envelope for classified documents shall be addressed to:</p>
<p>ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes<br />SIDC/PMO, Room #1701 <br />Phone: 719-567-0708</p>
<p><br />The outer envelope for classified documents shall be sealed with no identification as to the classification of its contents and addressed to:</p>
<p>SIDC/PMO<br />ATTN: Ms. Lee Ann Backes <br />24 Talon Way<br />Schriever AFB CO 80912<br /><br />All TOP SECRET, SCI and Communications Security (COMSEC) information and materials should be transmitted through your servicing Special Security Office (SSO) via the Defense Courier Service (DEFCOS) to:</p>
<p>(OUTER WRAPPER):<br />432150 CS00<br />HKC006 DC7 CS 023</p>
<p>This provides an approved secure means of transmission to SSO SCHRIEVER. Inner wrapper must contain classification, and identify intended recipient by organization, rank, name, building/room number and phone number. Since SSO SCHRIEVER serves all SCI-accredited units on Schriever AFB, the inner wrapper provides them with contact information once they receive and open the article. <br /><br />Organizations under existing NRO contracts can also use Management Services and Operations (MS&amp;O) for transmission of SCI to NOPS SCHRIEVER. Again, contact information is required to ensure proper delivery upon receipt. <br /><br />3. For classified submissions: Prior to submission, notify Ms. Lee Ann Backes, leeann.backes@us.af.mil, (719)567-0708, that you will be submitting classified documentation and the method you will use for submission.<br /><br />4. Hand Deliveries: The courier shall deliver the package to the Schriever AFB Visitor Control Center. Couriers must notify the SIDC Security Office in advance in order to have someone meet them at the Visitor Control Center. If they are authorized to enter the base, they can deliver the package directly to the SIDC. The SIDC discourages hand deliveries, preferring electronic submission through JWICS.<br /><br />5. Overnight Delivery of Secret and Confidential Information: Please keep in mind the Government will not reimburse Respondees for any direct costs incurred as a result of submission of any documentation in response to this RFI. Twelve current holders of the General Services Administration carrier contract are approved for overnight domestic express delivery of Secret and Confidential information to and among contractor facilities and U.S. Government Agencies. The Information Security Oversight Office made this policy determination in March 10, 2004 correspondence with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Counterintelligence and Security. Additional information can be viewed at http://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs/classified-transmission.html:</p>
<p>Air Freight Plus, Inc.<br />AirNet Systems, Inc.<br />Associated Global Systems, Inc.<br />Astar USA, LLC<br />CorTrans Logistics, LLC<br />D.C. Dyna, Inc.(DBA: Cavalier Logistics)<br />Federal Express Corporation<br />Panther II Transportation, Inc.<br />Q International Courier, Inc.<br />Team Air Express, Inc.<br />United Parcel Service, Inc. (OH)<br />United States Postal Service. <br /><br />(Before mailing classified information, please check the URL provided above for the current approved contract carriers, as this list changes every fiscal year).<br /><br />As a reminder, Facility Security Officers must establish procedures to assure the proper protection of classified packages at each facility intending to use overnight service. These procedures must be formally approved by the Cognizant Security Office (CSO). Contractors must establish an approved street address for incorporation by Defense Security Service in the Central Verification Authority (CVA) before such shipments begin. The following requirements apply and must be reflected in the procedures approved by the CSO:<br /><br />1. The carriers listed above may be used for urgent overnight transmissions of SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL material within the continental United States when overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC information, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Foreign Government Information (FGI) may not be transmitted overnight. Please note that Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.<br /><br />2. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified material.<br /><br />3. Material must be prepared for transmission as described in NISPOM paragraph 5-401a, referenced in Section I, paragraph D(1), except that a carrier's mailing envelope may be used as the outer wrapper.<br /><br />4. The outer address label should contain only the office or position/title, of the destination facility, in this case, the "SIDC Security Office."<br /><br />5. A release signature block on the receipt label shall not be executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side) collection boxes is prohibited.<br /><br />6. As a general rule, packages may be shipped on Monday through Thursday only to ensure that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend. However, the CSO may grant local approval to ship material on a Friday provided the receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, and that he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage.<br /><br />7. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.</p>

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: FA8807-12-R-0005</p>
<p>Notice Type: Research and Development Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is seeking the following post 24 January 2013 Industry Day information to identify potential teaming arrangements among offerors for the Modernized Mission Planning System (M2PS), and to receive feedback from Industry regarding potential small business participation as well as general program questions.</p>
<p>Small Business Reference Number: 12-76</p>
<p>Response from small business firms is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Product Service Code (PSC): AD25 R&amp;D: Defense Services-Operational System Development</p>
<p>Description/Purpose: This is a market research questionnaire sources sought notice to solicit feedback from Industry regarding teaming arrangements and small business participation as well as ask general program questions. This information will help the government learn more about Industry requirements and capabilities.<br /><br />1. The Government would like to know which potential offerors plan to bid as a prime contractor and whom they anticipate teaming with for their subcontracting work. This teaming arrangement is not binding. Responses should simply list who is planning to bid as a prime contractor and who their proposed sub contractor(s) will be. <br />2. Please respond to the Small Business Market Research Questionnaire regarding small business participation.<br />3. Please respond to the general program questionnaire.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors should submit their teaming arrangements and questionnaire responses via email to Lt Ashley Hazel at SMC.GP.M2PS@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Small Business Market Research Questionnaire:</p>
<p>1. Considering the entire M2PS effort, what percentage of the work will be performed using in-house capabilities?</p>
<p>2. Provide a list of the general function(s) that will be performed using in-house capability. Provide the applicable NAICS code for each general function.</p>
<p>3. Considering the entire effort, what percentage of the work will be performed using subcontractor capabilities?</p>
<p>4. Provide a list of the general functions that will be performed using subcontractor capability. Provide the applicable NAICS code for each general function.</p>
<p>5. Considering the work to be subcontracted, what percentage of the work will be subcontracted with large business? Provide the applicable NAICS code for each general function.</p>
<p>6. Considering the work to be subcontracted, what percentage of the work will be subcontracted with small business? Provide the applicable NAICS code for each general function.</p>
<p>7. Considering the work to be subcontracted to large business, describe the impediments that prevent these functions being subcontracted with small businesses. What can be done to overcome these impediments?</p>
<p>8. How many FTE(s) (full time equivalent heads) are associated with the work projected to be subcontracted?</p>
<p>9. If possible, please provide a preliminary work breakdown structure to at least level 3 detailing what will be performed using in house capabilities versus that which will be subcontracted.</p>
<p><br />General Market Research Questionnaire:<br />1) According to the M2PS schedule provided at Industry Day, do the Ready to Operate Dates seem satisfactory compared to the RFP release and contract award dates? Is there enough development time in between contract award and v1 RTO and v2 RTO?<br />2) There are TS/SCI SAP aspects of M2PS. Prior to RFP release, potential Offerors will have to be read-in to the program. The SAP aspects pertain to the requirement documents. What is the minimum number of people per Offeror that need to be read-in to create a proposal? Please list the number and position of each person. <br />3) With a Cost Plus Award Fee/Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract type, what would be good incentives to motivate Offerors to meet government milestones? What would be an adequate incentive/award fee (quantitative amount)?<br />4) The proposed government development plan is to have two versions of M2PS (v1 and v2). V1 will consist of developmental testing but not operational testing. Operational testing will occur once v2 is ready to operate. What would be the best breakout of capabilities between v1 and v2? Would there be iterations of deliveries within each version?<br />Declaration: Proposals will not be accepted. This is neither a pre-solicitation nor a solicitation. Additionally, this notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts; and, it does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid and/or proposal preparation costs.</p>

Elastic attachments can be 3 needle flat-lock, 2 needle 401 or 2 needle 602 or 603 without cover.  Secondary construction such as leg hems or front opening fly hem shall be 2 needle 402 or 602 types or similar stitching types.  All stitching shall be flat on both sides of garment offering no protrusion, which is a potential area of chafing.   <br>  End of seams and stitches that are not caught in other seams or stitching shall be securely back tacked or back stitched.  Thread breaks or bobbin run-outs, occurring during sewing, shall be secured by stitching back of the break minimum of   inch.  Thread tension shall be maintained, so that there will be no loose stitching resulting in loose bobbin or top thread or excessively high stitching resulting in puckering of the materials sewn.  Thread ends shall be trimmed to a length of not more than   inch.  <br>    <br>  Seams   <br>  Seamed stitches per inch in needle /looper and cover threads shall be machine tensioned to allow finished, seam stretch properties to be maximized; preventing restriction of base fabric stretch/recovery properties.  If hand pulled to the maximum degree, seams shall not exhibit signs of cracking or breakage.   <br>    <br>  Any seam or attachment of any component exhibiting twisted, puckered, pleated or caught in any unrelated operation or stitching that is not properly forced out or contained in a fold shall be evaluated as a defect and rejected.    <br>    <br>  Puckering is evidence of failure to control stitching tension which results in tight tension.  When puckering is evident, seams shall be tested by pulling in a lengthwise direction of the seam or stitching.  Puckering due to the gathering of the material shall be evaluated as a seaming defect and rejected.  <br>    <br>  Tight Tension:  Failure of a seam to straighten or thread breakage shall be evidence of tight tension. Garments constructed with tight tension shall be deemed a seaming defect  and rejected.    <br>    <br>  Loose tension (more than 1 inch) is evidence of failure to control stitching tension, which results in loose tension garment.  Garments constructed with loose tension shall be deemed a seaming defect and rejected.      <br>    <br>  Seam Allowance: All 2, 3 and 4 needle type seam operations shall be constructed such that the needle, looper and cover threads cover all raw edges and offers maximum strength with no open, puckered, twisted or distorted seam appearance.  <br>    <br>  Thread   <br>  Sewing thread should be of correct TEX size as to provide sufficient overall strength and prevent cracking and/or breakage when the garment is stretched to maximum degree.   Stretch type threads, which assist in achieving maximum stretch quality, are encouraged for use.   Thread selected shall not create needle cutting or create a condition where the thread slices through base fabric.   <br>    <br>  Waistband   <br>  Use of knitted elastic, ranging from 1 to 1   inch width waistband, shall be sewn such that the elastic interfaces in a smooth, flat manner to body of the PUG. Stitching shall be adjusted so that no seam cracking or breakage is exhibited when the waistband is pulled to maximum degree.  Back center seam, attaching sides of elastic ends, shall be smooth and flat with no protruding stitches.  Elastic type shall be heat resistant to laundering and drying and be capable of enduring long term storage in hot conditions.  Knitted type elastic shall be resistant to needle cutting to prevent elastic ends from protruding along the back center seam during wearing and laundering.    <br>    <br>  Tunnel type waistbands are disallowed. Any tunnel-type waistband, to include but not limited to covered elastic waistbands,  drawstring waistbands or any type of waistband that places gathered fabric (ruching) next to the wearer's skin, is not allowed. These types of waistband construction may cause discomfort to the wearer, especially when worn under clothing items and/or military gear.    <br>    <br>  A tunnel-type waistband is defined as any type of elastic or drawstring partially or fully encased in fabric.  In tunnel type waistbands, the elastic or drawstring could be free-floating or the elastic could be stitched through all plies with one or several rows of stitching. Additionally, the elastic may or may not be exposed to some degree, if stitched in the aforementioned manner. The tunnel, or casing, need not be open internally for the full circumference of the waistband, as would be required for a drawstring waistband, in order to be considered a tunnel-type waistband.    <br>    <br>  Fly 	  <br>  Fly opening stitching shall be flat and smooth with no protrusions or obstructions and be capable of recovering from opening upon use.  <br>    <br>  Leg Hems    <br>  All leg hems shall be constructed as to offer a maximum degree of stretch that will not crack or break the stitch line upon stretching and recover to original shape. Tunnel type elastic constructions ranging from   to 1 quote mark  width are allowed.  <br>    <br>  Ballistic pocket/panel    <br>  Ballistic pocket attachments shall not restrict or interfere with overall stretch of PUG.  Attachments include 2 needle 402, 602 or Zigzag types 304, 308 or similar stitching types.  <br>    <br>  Bartacks   <br>    -   inch bartacks at 24 - 32 total stitches shall be placed at all critical places such as top/ bottom of fly opening, ballistic panel pocket flaps or other high stress areas.  <br>    <br>  Labels    <br>  Care labels shall be in accordance with FTC labeling regulations.  The size label shall include the nominal size (i.e. small, medium, etc.) and, in parenthesis, the waist measurement in inches.

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is Modification 2 to the synopsis entitled "Center Safety and Fire Operations (CSFO) Contract," which was posted on February 22, 2013 under the Reference Number NNJ1361974L-1 The purpose of this modification is the following: (1) The CSFO Interested Parties List has been updated on the CSFO website. (2) NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Center Safety and Fire Operations (CSFO) Contract.  The nature of the work anticipated under the CSFO may create a situation where there could be the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the CSFO.  Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the CSFO will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues. This list is not all inclusive.  Assessment of ground-based hardware designs, analysis, and models developed for the JSC by Contractors, and Space Act Agreement Participants;   Assessment of new technology disclosures (aka invention disclosures) including, for example, new and novel hardware, software, and processes;   Access to Government Sensitive or Privacy Act Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements or personal injury data and rates of other contractors;   Access to a Contractor, or Space Act Agreement Participants proprietary information where said Contractor, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the CSFO Contractor;	 Safety oversight for test and evaluation of hardware and procedures.	 Safety surveillance of construction and facility operations, facility inspections, safety reviews of facility design and modification, and preliminary mishap investigations. These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the CSFO contract:   Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the CSFO Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract;   Potential impaired objectivity if the CSFO contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors;   Potential impaired objectivity if the CSFO contractor or its subcontractors or related companies are responsible for assessing or performing safety assurance for hardware or data generated by the CSFO contractor, its subcontractors, or related companies under another JSC contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or Space Act Agreement;   Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASAs preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASAs evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement.  Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions:  1. What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the CSFO contract?  2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.  3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed CSFO that were not identified in this RFI?  4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the CSFO that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential CSFO RFP?  A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to the CSFO procurement website at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/csfo/	. Please reference this document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCI issues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this synopsis. Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. CDT on April 8, 2013. Please reference (NNJ1361974L-1) in any response.  NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerors proposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigation strategy in writing. NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examine possible circumstances, which might lead to or eliminate an OCI. It will not be a confirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror can successfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI. Furthermore, the response in no way alters or interprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to an RFP issued under a solicitation for CSFO. Subsequent to the initial submission and response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI.  The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes to allow industry the opportunity to comment and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submitted it. Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.  The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent. All questions should be directed to the point of contact identified below. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited under this RFI. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Modification 5 of the solicitation of two Prospectuses to operate marina facilities at Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area
The National Park Service (NPS) has issued Modification 5 adjusting insurance requirements as provided in Exhibit I of the Draft Contracts and extending the closing date of the solicitation for services at the Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas located within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The two prospectuses are for two different levels of service as well as two different term lengths for the same area and are described below.
-Full service marina operation identified as Full Service Draft Contract includes houseboat and other boat rentals, moorage, retail/grocery, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Full Service Draft Contract is for a term of fifteen (15) years.
-Limited service marina operation identified as Limited Service Draft Contract includes moorage, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Limited Service Draft Contract is for a term of ten (10) years.
The Service is interested in maintaining an appropriate level of service on the south end of Lake Roosevelt and therefore have created the two prospectuses to help facilitate interest in bidding. However, if the Service receives a responsive offer, as that term is defined in 36 C.F.R. Part 51, for the Full Service Draft Contract, regardless of whether the Service receives a responsive offer for the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will cancel the Prospectus for the Limited Service Draft Contract before award and select a Concessioner for the Full Service Draft Contract. If the Service only receives a responsive bid to the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will select a concessioner for that Contract. In either case the final contract will be awarded under Concession Contract No. CC-LARO001-13.
All Proposals must now be received by the Pacific West Region, Attention: Commercial Services Manager, 333 Bush Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA, 94104, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on April 25, 2013. If you choose to retrieve a copy of the prospectuses from the Service website at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm please notify Kimberley Gagliolo via email at kim_gagliolo@nps.gov so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence.

<DESC>This synopsis is for amendment 0001 to RFP N0038313RD219. The amendment notifies interested parties of the quantity increase to 25 units. Raytheon Technical Services Co. (CAGE: 072E5) is the only approved source to repair.
 
The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company&#39;s experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 
 
https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx
 
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Each stone piece shall meet the following test requirements for quality:  <br>    <br>  		Test	Requirement  <br>    <br>  	(1)	Specific Gravity (BSSD)	2.60 minimum.  <br>  		(ASTM C127-88(2001) (CRD-C 107)  <br>    <br>  	(2)	Absorption	Not more than 3 percent  <br>  		(ASTM C127-88(2001) (CRD-C 107)  <br>    <br>  (3)	Abrasion				        Not more than 20 percent loss  <br>  		(ASTM C131-96) (CRD-C 117)  <br>    <br>  	(4)	Accelerated Expansion  <br>  	(CRD-C 148)			     	        Not more than 10 percent breakdown  <br>    <br>  		(5)	Magnesium Sulfate Soundness, 5 cycles  <br>  			(ASTM C88-99a) (CRD-C 137)	      	        Not more than 10 percent loss  <br>    <br>  	(6)	Drop Test				        No breakage or cracking  <br>    <br>  2.  Laboratory Stone Testing.  Previous test results may be requested to verify quality.  The following represent test procedures specified recently on Corps projects to determine quality:  <br>    <br>  (1) Specific Gravity and Absorption: Weight per cubic foot will be determined by multiplying the bulk-saturated-surface-dry specific gravity (BSSD) times 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. Specific gravity and absorption will be determined in accordance with ASTM C127 (Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 107), modified as follows:  The test sample will consist of about 5,000 grams of generally cubical pieces of stone passing the 2-inch and retained on the 1-1/2 inch standard square mesh sieve sizes. Test pieces will be laboratory prepared by jaw crushing and chipping. Test method permits a variance in reproduction of test results of 0.02 in BSSD specific gravity and 0.05 percent in percentage of absorption. This variance in specific gravity is equivalent to a variance of plus-or-minus 1.2 pounds per cubic foot in unit weights computed from the specific gravity.  <br>    <br>  (2)	Abrasion:  Abrasion loss will be determined in accordance with ASTM C131 (Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 117), modified as follows:  Test sample will be of the same size and gradation as that described above for use in determination of specific gravity and absorption, the abrasive charge used will comply with that used in Grading  quote mark A quote mark , and the test sample will be subjected to 500 revolutions. The standard test method designated ASTM C535 (CRD-C 145) shall not be substituted for ASTM C131.  <br>    <br>  (3)	Accelerated Expansion (15 Days):  The test sample will be tested in accordance with Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 148, except as herein specified. Testing procedure for sample size in CRD-C 148 will be modified as follows:  The test sample will be from 4,950 grams (10.83 pounds) to 5,050 grams (11.05 pounds) of 1-1/2 inch to 2 inch pieces. Test results will be computed by dividing the number of pieces that breakdown by the number of pieces in the original test sample.  Failure or breakdown is defined as any piece separating into two or more pieces or losing sufficient surface material to allow it to pass through the 1-112 inch sieve.  Maximum allowable breakdown is 10 percent over a period of 15 days. Weight loss based on the original oven dry weight will be recorded.  <br>    <br>  (4)	Magnesium Sulfate Soundness:  The test is based upon ASTM C88 (CRD-C 137).  Test sample will be similar to that described above for use in determination of specific gravity and absorption.  This test, which will be conducted through five cycles, which requires 2 to 3 weeks time for completion.  <br>    <br>  3.  Physical Stone Testing by Drop Test.  A drop test provides an immediate evaluation of the durability of very large stones during handling of the stone including placement into a structure.  If requested, several representative test stones shall be dropped from a bucket or by other means from a height of not less than half the average diameter of the stone onto a rigid surface or second stone of comparable size.  Dumping from a truck is not acceptable.  The stone shall be examined carefully before as well as after the completion of the test.  Failure criteria are the development of new cracks, opening of old cracks, and the loss of a piece from the surface of the stone.  Each stone that is to be tested shall be dropped a total of five times for evaluation purposes with examination after each drop.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary equipment and operating personnel to help perform the testing.  Drop tests shall be conducted by the Contractor under the supervision of the Contracting Officer.  <br>    <br>  4.  Quarry Operations.  Quarry operations shall be conducted by the Contractor in a manner that shall produce stone conforming to the requirements specified and may involve selected quarrying, handling, processing, blending, and loading as necessary.  Blasting and handling of rock shall be controlled by the Contractor to produce rock of the size ranges and quality specified.  Techniques such as the use of proper hole diameter, hole depth, hole angle, burden, and spacing distances, types and distribution of explosives, delay intervals and sequence, removal of muck piles between each shot, and special handling techniques are required as necessary to produce the specified materials.  All aspects of blasting operations shall be specifically designed so that the end product is not damaged from the blasting technique and that the stone is suitable for the intended purpose.  <br>    <br>  2)	Stone Material Gradations:  <br>    <br>  Class I Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	150	13-17  <br>  50% Size	50	9-13  <br>  90% Larger	25	7-9  <br>  10% Range	15-25	5-7  <br>    <br>  Class II Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	500	20-26  <br>  50% Size	200	14-20  <br>  90% Larger	100	10-14  <br>  10% Range	25-100	7-11  <br>    <br>  Class III Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	800	22-30  <br>  50% Size	300	16-22  <br>  90% Larger	150	12-16  <br>  10% Range	25-150	7-13  <br>    <br>  Class IV Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	1000	24-36  <br>  50% Size	400	18-24  <br>  90% Larger	200	14-20  <br>  10% Range	25-200	7-15  <br>    <br>  Class V Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	1800	28-42  <br>  50% Size	750	22-28  <br>  90% Larger	350	17-23  <br>  10% Range	25-350	7-18  <br>    <br>  Class VI Riprap  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	3600	38-52  <br>  50% Size	1500	26-38  <br>  90% Larger	700	22-27  <br>  10% Range	250-700	15-23  <br>    <br>  2-4 Ton Rock  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	8000	52-66  <br>  50% Size	6000	38-52  <br>  100% Larger	4000	22-30  <br>    <br>  6-8 Ton Rock  <br>    <br>  Distribution	Weight (lb)	Diameter (in)  <br>  100% Smaller	16000	60-78  <br>  50% Size	14000	54-70  <br>  100% Larger	12000	30-42  <br>    <br>  Other Material Specifications:  <br>    <br>  Embankment Material  <br>    <br>  A Satisfactory Material consists of materials classified in accordance with ASTM D 2487 as SW, GW, GP-GM, and SP-SM, free from: roots and other organic matter; contamination from hazardous, toxic or radiological substances; trash, debris; and frozen materials.

When calculating the lowest price for rock, the following formula is used to determine which source is most economically delivered to the site.  <br>    <br>  a. 	Drive the truck route from quarry to work site and enter the mileage.  <br>    <br>  b. 	Calculate the number of minutes needed for a loaded dumptruck to complete one round.  <br>    <br>  c. 	Divide the number of minutes per trip by 60 minute per hour.  <br>    <br>  d. 	Multiply the result by the hourly dumptruck rate; (ex. $100 solo, $115 truck & pup)  <br>    <br>  e. 	Divide the result by the number of tons per load (typ. 13 per solo and 28 per truck & pup)  <br>  Where: 60 minutes are needed to complete one roundtrip and; the  job will be built using solo trucks at $100 per hour; 60 minutes per trip divided by 60 minutes per hour equals 1.  1 multiplied by the hourly rate ($100) equals 100; 100 divided by 13 tons per solo load equals $ 7.70 per ton.  Added to a rock cost of $5.00 per ton, this would total $12.70 per ton on site.  <br>  f. 	Compare the results from competing quarries to determine the low offer.  <br>  75 minutes /trip; using a solo truck at $100/hr; 75 divided by 60 min/hr = 1.25; 1.25 x $100 per hour = $125; divided by 13 ton load = $9.62 per ton.  Added to a rock cost of $4.00 per ton, this would total $13.62 per ton on site.  <br>  g. 	In this example, the first site, despite a higher per ton rock cost, is 15 minutes closer and therefore, slightly more economical when considering overall in-place costs.  <br>  2. 	This formula has been used by Emergency Management for 25 years and accurately reflects the average in-place cost of rock, as determined by the combination of materials costs, distance and transportation time from the rock source to the work site.   <br>    <br>  This package shall be sent by e-mail to the following address: sharon.j.gonzalez@usace.army.mil and clearly labeled with the firm's name and sources sought title: Delivered Materials BPA for Emergency Flood Response at various Eastern Flood Basins supported by Seattle District, US Army Corps of Engineers, Washington.

<DESC>This is a 95% draft specification and drawing package for potential contractors to review for the rehabilitation of two Francis turbine runners at the Denison Powerhouse, Denison, Texas.    <br>      <br>   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   <br>      <br>   The work shall include engineering and design to optimize power, performance and efficiency of the turbine runner. The existing units, rated at 35 MW., were placed into operation in 1945 and 1949, and are currently in daily operation. The existing turbine is a vertical axis Francis runner rated 56,000 hp at a rated head of 102.5 feet operating at a speed of 90 rpm. The new turbine will be optimized to specified peak performance at approximately 102.5 ft of head. The contractor shall furnish and install a new Francis turbine runner, new wicket gates and refurbish linkages, operating ring, servo, headcover, stay ring, thrust bearing, etc. The Generators have previously been rewound under another contract in approximately 2005 to a rating of 53.5 MVA (53MW). Turbine model and efficiency testing will be required on completion of the rehabilitation. This work will require coordination with the Corps of Engineers staff for all activities related to construction. Estimated construction time is 560 days.    <br>      <br>   The intent of this posting is to receive feedback from potential contractors to have concise documents for proposal of this intricate work.  Feedback should be done through Bidder Inquiry in ProjNet as instructed in Paragraph 2.0 of Section 00 21 00 of the SF 1442.   <br>      <br>   Please direct questions to the Contract Specialist Pamela Moody at pamela.s.moody@usace.army.mil or 918-669-7457.

<AWARDEE>TerraTherm, Inc.
<DESC><div>The Da Nang Airport is referred to as a dioxin &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; due to the high levels of dioxin in the soils and sediments. Project goals include: remediation of 73,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil and sediment to below Government of Vietnam (GVN) clean-up standards, which will enable critical airport expansion needs and provide for the health and safety of nearly 800,000 residents living near the airport; and development and testing of innovative remediation technologies and methodologies for broad dissemination. &nbsp;For the performance of this contract to be completely successful, the required results of this contract are to achieve concentrations of dioxin in soils and sediment placed into the IPTD pile structure following treatment to less than 150 parts per trillion (ppt). &nbsp;The aforementioned required results are sometimes referred to herein as the &ldquo;cleanup goals&rdquo; or &ldquo;cleanup standard(s).&rdquo; The soils and sediments will be treated in two phases, Phase I and Phase II, each of which contains approximately one-half of the dioxin contaminated material on site. ISTD/IPTD technology was selected as the preferred alternative through a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of potential alternatives, consistent with US environmental regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This contract was awarded to TerraTherm, Inc. (TerraTherm) on a sole source basis through a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee(CPFF), Completion type of contract. TerraTherm is the sole holder (licensee) of worldwide rights to use the ISTD/IPTD technology. &nbsp;CPFF completion type contract was determined to be the appropriate type because uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with a high degree of certainty or accuracy to use a fixed-price contract.</div>

<DESC>TARR-NC	3 May 2012 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> URGENT & COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION <br>  <br> The Directorate of Maintenance has an urgent requirement for a service contract to provide 6ea M915A3 <br> Cabs in support of Red River Army Depot M915A3 Rebuild Production Lines. Also request the 6ea M915A3 <br> Cabs be picked up and returned by KAMLO, LLC. 174 CR 4291 DeKalb, TX 75559. The cost of the service with shipping and handling is	. RRAD currently has ongoing M915A3 programs for TACOM and USARC this urgent requirement is to be used to immediately support the RRAD production lines. <br>  <br> a. Source of Supply/Service: RRAD is currently working M915A3 rebuild programs for USARC and TACOM customers. RRAD has enough cabs available to support 1 to 2 months production then our production lines will be halted due to a lack of serviceable cabs. After a 30 day ramp up KAMLO, LLC can rebuild and test all cabs to enable RRAD to meet production schedule. Schedule 6ea June <br>  <br> b. Action to Determine Sources:  15 March 2012,	conducted research on possible contractors capable of rebuilding M915A3 Cabs. KAMLO LLC has prior experience rebuilding Cabs as a sub-contractor for Badger Truck Center on a M915 Maintenance contract. This is an urgent requirement the contractor must be able to ramp up quickly and supply 6ea M915A3 Cabs to support RRAD production lines while a larger cab contract is being solicited. See below for contractor history. <br>  <br> CONTRACT W911RQ08D0006 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0001 TOTAL=30 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0002 TOTAL=178 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0004 TOTAL=26 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0005 TOTAL=30 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0006 TOTAL=30 <br>  <br>   	Delivery Order 0007 TOTAL=120 <br>  <br> TOTAL CABs refurbished = 414 <br>  <br> c. Result or Loss if not accomplished:  This potentially impacts RRAD's ability to meet the current production schedule which defers the opportunity of fulfilling TACOM's and USAR's customer schedule for fielding's. If we are unable to obtain this service, this could result in the loss of this workload to RRAD resulting in a loss in revenue of approximately	dollars and a loss of approximately	man-hours. <br>  <br> Based on the above known facts, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government to forego competitive procedures for this particular procurement. <br> POC/Requester: Typed Name: <br> Date: 3 May 2012 <br> Title: Planner / COR Signature: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Supervisor/Director: Typed Name: <br> Date: 12/13/2011 <br> Title: Chief, Major Equip Plng Br <br>  <br> Signature: <br>   <br> Competition Management Officer: Typed Name:		.
