<SUBJECT>Z--Intent to Negotiate with Reece Albert, Inc. for Proprietary Materials for Repair and Resurfacing of the Asphalt Test and Non-Test Surfaces on the Track at San Angelo Facility, Goodfellow AFB, TX

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), intends to negotiate with Reece Albert, Inc. (RAI), San Angelo, Texas on a sole source basis under the Statutory Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The requirement is for repair and resurfacing of the Asphalt Test and Non-Test Surfaces on the Track at San Angelo Facility, Goodfellow Air Force Base, Texas. 

NHTSA, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) operates a Uniform Tire Quality Grading System facility in San Angelo, Texas.  In 1994, OVS installed a Traction Grading Test Track, an oval driving track that features calibrated concrete and asphalt test surfaces for wet traction testing to the requirements of 49 CFR 575.104.  The facility is used for compliance testing under the cited NHTSA regulation and for certification testing by tire manufacturers.  In order for this track to be suitable for testing, its surfaces must be periodically repaired, maintained and calibrated, as necessary. 
 
Reece Albert, Inc is the sole source based on the following:

1.  RAI was contracted by OVSC to install the original Traction Grading Test Track to the requirements of Manual for the Construction and Maintenance of Skid Surfaces, National Technical Information Service No. DOT HS-800-814.   RAI is the only company that knows the exact sources for the materials and aggregate that was used for the skid surface fabricated in 1990.  Any variations will increase the risk of a substandard product.

2.  Since RAI performed the basic work, it is best qualified to determine the most efficient way to restore the track, the best way to repair the cracks for surface stability, and the best repair and patching compounds to insure maximum chemical bonding between the old surfaces and the new surfaces.  

3.  Further, RAI uses proprietary materials obtained from their own quarry to provide the appropriate skid surface coefficient of friction range.

The anticipated period of performance is for a 60 days.  A fixed price contract is anticipated.  

No solicitation package will be issued.     THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested firms must submit a maximum of three, but not less than two pages addressing their capabilities, as identified above to the named point of contact, providing clear and convincing evidence of the firm’s capability to provide the required services.  Written capability statements must be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered.  Such documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephone calls made in place of the required documentation will not be accepted.  

For Minority, Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small Business and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has a program to assist minority, women-owned, and disadvantage business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302 from Diverse Technologies Corporation (DTC).  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire financial, auditing, marketing, outreach and policy development support to the NIH Division of Loan Repayment/NIH Intramural Loan Repayment Program.  
Diverse Technologies Corporation has specialized programmatic knowledge and experience to provide the analytical/data reporting support required.  The NIH Intramural Loan Repayment Program is a complex program.  Diverse Technologies Corporation is familiar with the nature of the work and has developed techniques for accomplishing tasks in an efficient and cost effective manner.  Having Diverse Technologies Corporation provide these services allows for continuity of the activities without loss of productivity.  

The period of performance shall be 12 months starting on or about July 27, 2006. 

Building on programmatic knowledge and experience, the contractor shall accomplish the following tasks: 

Provide policy development and marketing services to the Loan Repayment Plan (LRP).

a)	Develop and produce the Annual Report for the DLR.  This includes obtaining and proofing data, formatting and design of the report;

b)	Assist the Director of DLR and the Director of Operations with policy related issues and policy development.  This may include developing regulations, DLR policy statements, decision memoranda, answering data calls, and providing responses to ad-hoc requests for program data;

c)	Develop presentations for the DLR using knowledge of program and programmatic data;

d)	Contribute to the development of LRP responses to GPRA, STEM, CFDA, CACR, Budget, and other NIH, HHS, OMB, or Congressional mandates and/or inquiries;

e)	Prepares program fact sheets, and other marketing material for the LRP for various audiences and for various needs;

f)	Produce an information bulletin for the DLR;

g)	Assist with the evaluation contract to study the effectiveness of the NIH Extramural Loan Repayment Programs—making sure that delivery schedules are met and deliverables are distributed in a timely fashion;

h)	Provide general financial analysis, process quarterly payments, assist with quarterly service verifications, and reconciliation of the 1099 data;

i)	Provide a resource to share information program materials and discussions regarding the LRP’s.

j)	Responsible for clearance of DLR forms through NIH and OMB;

k)	Provide backup to the LRP help desk.


Provide basic financial services to the LRP.

a)	Set-up quarterly payments on the NIH Administrative Database (ADB).  Using the LRP financial Management Information System (MIS) and the ADB, payments are scheduled on a quarterly basis;

b)	Resolve misapplied payments.  These are payments that were not sent to the proper lender or were not applied to the proper account.  The LRP is responsible for working with the lender and the participant to determine why the payment was not received and to correct all deficiencies-- through credit back to the NIH, Office of Financial Management if necessary;

c)	Handle Loan Consolidations.  When participants consolidate their loans, the LRP requires the participant to submit supporting documentation such as the consolidation disclosure statement to ensure that loans not covered by the LRP are not added.  The MIS and the ADB will be updated accordingly to reflect the changes in the repayment schedule due to the consolidation;

d)	Monitor and follow-up on payments that are not verified for over 90-days.  This process requires documentation of payment to be submitted to the LRP by the payee.  If not received, then payment verification can become stale and must be pursued by contacting the participant; and

e)	Review documents submitted during the annual application cycle to establish that an individual is eligible for the program and has the proper financial documentation to support their loan debt.  Promissory notes and account statements will be reviewed, tallied, and selected data entered into the LRP MIS database.    

Provide auditing support and business process consultation.

a)	Advise management on financial matters (budgeting for additional tax reimb, obligation control, 1099 reconciliation, Form 1099-G issuance)

b)	Advise management on operational procedures (PV, SV, financial vetting, segregation of duties, tracking of open payment issues, scenarios causing 1099 difference)

c)	Advise management on administrative and program execution policies (program     eligibility, terminations, breach of contract, BOC penalties, SV, LWOP, COI) 

d)	Oversee the DLR internal audit process (contract pre-close, termination, closeout, final closeout; and tax reimbursement request)

e)	Respond to technical tax reimbursement request inquiries and advises others preparing responses to general and compliance requests
f)	Participate with system design (accounting modules, SV application, MIS enhancements)

g)	Prepare or oversees preparation of procedure manuals or guidelines (tax reimb requests, contract audits, termination audits and LWOP workflow)

h)	Track and follows-up on audit-determined collectible amounts, and coordinate the action taken following our collection of a receivable amount

i)	Prepare decision memos to NIH management for obtaining approval of recommended LRP-related policies or procedures

j)	Respond to participant inquiries regarding fluctuation of their repayable debt and decrease in amount of final quarterly payment


NLM has determined that DTC is uniquely qualified to provide the above services.  DTC has highly specialized and relevant expertise.  Having DTC provide the services outline above allows for continuity of the activities without loss of productivity.  A company other than DTC would require LRP management to spend time orienting and training staff.  Consequently, fewer services could be provided in the same amount of time and the LRP would operate less efficiently and effectively.  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for master melts, 5 ea; slab molds, 5 ea.; heat treatment, 1 job, optional melt & mold, 1 job. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from FCC Airfoils Inc. of Minerva OH.  NASA GRC has spent five years measuring the effects of composition on airfoil properties using creep testing, analytical science, metallographic, and factographic evaluations on approximately 15 different alloy compositions.The results represent a comprehensive database on single crystal airfoil alloys, all baselined on the casting and heat treating operations previously performed at PCC Airfoils. The quality and mechanical properties of advanced superalloys are highly sensitive to the process and handling techniques employed during casting by a vendor. The heat transfer characteristics of the proprietary casting equipment and its environment during the directional solidification process invariably induce localized, dendritic segregation in composition and microstructure of a single crystal casting.  This segregation has significant effects on important mechanical properties such as creep resistance, as well as microstructural phase stability.  After solidification, heat treatments are performed to reduce some of the segregation in chemistry and to refine the precipitate microstructure.  The heat treatment effects on the casting material are again sensitive to the proprietary design and characteristics of the furnaces and cooling systems used in these heat treatments.	 NASA GRC does not have access to the proprietary designs of PCC Airfoils' casting and heat treating equipment.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 27, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>OVERVIEW: This combine synopsis and solicitation for commercial items in support of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) has been prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; no other solicitation will be issued. CSOSA is an independent, executive branch Federal Agency, established under Section 11232 of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA is seeking sources with proposals that have a robust research design with clearly defined public safety and justice performance measures.  Additionally, these proposals shall address cost-benefit issues and represent a strong collaborative relationship with CSOSA’s Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and Community Justice Programs (CJP). DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: 	Your proposals shall include cross-sectional, time-series, multi-cohort, or other appropriate approaches necessary to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes implemented to link offenders to current contracts (CSOSA funded) or public (externally funded) substance abuse treatment services.  The objective is to ensure timely and appropriate linkages of offenders to substance abuse treatment.  In attending to this objective, we enhance program development practices focusing specifically on reducing substance use and dependency among treatment participants.  CSOSA is interested in proposals that document current state and any efficiencies and or inefficiencies that are inherent to current processes.  Because public safety is paramount, the Government request that you identify methods for assessing the alignment between prioritization protocols, policies and procedures regulating the implementation of such activities, and the actual implementation of activities in the field.  The Government is interested in proposals that include detailed descriptions of outputs along each stage of the treatment placement continuum – officer referral of offender for evaluation, evaluation by treatment specialist, placement referral, vendor placement, treatment monitoring, and aftercare coordination.  Particular attention should be given to describing these processes for types of offenders as identified by categories of prioritization. The proposal must include an assessment of treatment staff’s and supervision officers’ perceptions about the effectiveness and efficiency of the process as well as their understanding of ‘close monitoring’ responsibilities while offenders are in treatment.   To better understand the implementation of ‘close monitoring’ practices while offenders are in treatment, CSOSA encourages methodological consideration that may include randomized field observations. For the purpose of this project, CSOSA defines contract treatment as treatment provided to an offender and paid for with internal resources.  Such treatment follows a special condition from one of the releasing authorities, treatment initiated by a supervision officer and typically following drug use surveillance, or self-referral by the offender.  The agency business hours are 7:00AM till 6:00PM, Monday through Friday, except Federal Holidays. The Government observes the following Federal Holidays as non-work days: 1. New Year Day, 2. Martin Luther King Birthday, 3. Washington Birthday, 4. Memorial Day, 5. Independence Day, 6. Labor Day, 7. Columbus Day, 8. Veterans Day, 9. Thanksgiving Day, 10. Christmas Day, 11. Inauguration Day (every fourth year). The Government business hours may also change at the discretion and mutual agreement between the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR). PROPOSALS:  Interested firms shall submit a WRITTEN and PRICE proposal to qualify for award of this requirement. CSOSA requires proposals to distinguish between prioritization categories and referral type (when appropriate). Your proposal must state the problem under investigation (including goals and objectives of the proposed project) and the relevance of the project to public safety and justice in Washington, D.C. and surrounding jurisdictions.  You must also state the research question and objectives with clearly defined statement of the relevance to community supervision in Washington, D.C.  Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the relevance of research questions and the appropriateness of the methods and analytical approach (es). The WRITTEN proposal shall constitute an abstract (not to exceed 400 words); Program Narrative (not to exceed 20 pages – double space 12pt font); Research question or problem; Research goals and objectives; Research design and methods; Implications for operations improvement and policy development; Dissemination plan for project deliverables; Description of costs; Staffing plan; and Timeline (to include milestones and deliverables). Note:  All tables, figures, and chart should be placed in appendices. CSOSA encourages collaboration with culturally competent researchers or practitioners who have a demonstrated track record implementing evaluation projects focused on the challenges of underserved, ethnic minority, and criminal justice populations.  Letters of support should be included in an appendix. Federal regulations require that procedures be outlined for protecting private information about individuals.  Upon receipt of the proposals, the Government will schedule oral presentations. The evaluation will be conducted by a peer-review panel. The panelists will consider both technical and programmatic merits. These panelists will be selected based on their expertise in subject areas pertinent to the proposals. Upon final evaluation, the Government will determine those individuals considered to be in the competitive range. All individuals will be notified in writing of their standing as it relates to this requirement. All offerors must have demonstrated Quality and technical merit to include (1) Awareness of the state of current research or technology (2) Soundness of methodology and analytic and technical approach (3) Feasibility of proposed project and awareness pitfalls and (4) Innovation and creativity (when appropriate); Impact of the proposed project  to include (1) Relevance for improving the policy and practice of community supervision in Washington, D.C. to include improvements to public safety, security, and quality of life, (2) Feasibility and cost-benefit assessment of proposed strategies and/or recommendations and (3) Potential for significant advances in the field; Capabilities, demonstrated productivity, and experience of applicants that include (1) Qualifications and experience of proposed staff, (2) Ethnic/cultural diversity of proposed staff, (3)
Demonstrated ability of proposed staff and organization to manage the effort; (4) Adequacy of the plan to manage the project, including how various tasks are subdivided with clearly defined metrics for monitoring timing of milestones and deliverables and (5) 
Demonstrated a track record conducting evaluation projects within federal agencies with direct operations responsibilities; a Budget that reflects (1) Total cost of the project; (2) Appropriateness of the budget relative to the level of effort and (3) Use of existing resources to conserve costs (to utilization of internal research and evaluation staff). Dissemination strategy that has a well-defined plan for the offeror  to share results with appropriate audiences, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers and suggestions for print and electronic products CSOSA might develop for practitioners and policymakers. In addition CSOSA is requiring contractors to establish an independent review team to review project plans and evaluation methodology. This requirement should be reflective in your proposal submission as a separate line item cost. Once the competitive range has been determined, it is envisioned a single or multiple awards will be issued. Upon issuance of an award, the Government will release the first task to support this requirement for submission of a proposal. All unescorted Contractor personnel utilized under this award submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any CSOSA facility. The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to a past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security.  When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative. The following forms will be provided and must be completed: (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor Preliminary Background Check Form. It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract. To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation, unless the Office of Security grants approval. (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position. At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR. Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible reviewing the forms for completeness.  The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee. Government Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason. (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual(s) presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk of CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Provisions, applicable to this combined synopsis and solicitation, are incorporated, in full, by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors and FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications. Offerors shall complete and return with their offer only paragraph (j) of FAR 52.212-3 if the annual representations and certifications were submitted online (electronically) at: orca.bpn.gov.

No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of a response to this notice.  

The Government anticipates awarding four cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract modifications.  The period of performance will be 36 months for this effort with a range of $16M to a maximum of $20M. 

Acquisition Environment:  The statutory authority, which permits other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c) (1), as implemented by 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (A); Only one source, or limited number of sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The program office plans to issue the RFP on 24 Jul 06 and award this contract by 8 Nov 06.

Requirements:

1.	Provide support to individual platform/store program offices in their efforts toward integration of UAI requirements into their specific Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission Planning Environment (MPE) upgrades. This support will be situational and will depend on need and a request from the Program Office for such support.  Support may be provided at all program phases of an OFP upgrade, including requirements definition and generation, system development and demonstration, and system testing and fielding.

2.	Provide Platform/Store Interface Control Document (PSICD),  Mission Planning (MPICD) and Launch Acceptable Region Data Package (LARDP) Super Joint Interface Control Working Group (SJICWG) support, to consist of secretariat functions utilizing a secure WEB site provided by the Government, providing key technical support in generating proposed changes or additions to the PSICD, MPICD, and LARDP packages and associated Certification Compliance Plans, as well as providing partial support from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) programs not currently funded for UAI implementation to participate in SJICWG activities.  All SJICWG support will follow the specified processes outlined in the UAI Interface Control Plan. 

3.	Perform a Risk Reduction study for incorporation of follow on interface requirements into current UAI development efforts.  Follow on interface requirements are defined as those that are outside the scope of current UAI development efforts, and include but are not limited to: Air to Air stores; Post launch Communications (i.e. Weapons Data Link Network (WDLN); Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); Joint Miniature Munition Interface (JMMI) and/or Miniature Munition/Store Interface (MMSI) interfaces currently used between Bomb Release Unit -61 (BRU-61) and Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I); targeting and training pods; joint service platform and store programs not included in current efforts; and foreign manufactured platforms and stores.  This effort will include technical reports and presentations documenting potential candidates identified, feasibility, trade studies, as well as roadmaps and plans for incorporating interfaces from these systems or technologies into the UAI program.  For those interfaces or technologies deemed feasible for near-term inclusion into UAI, draft Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and associated draft Interface Change Notices (ICNs) will be generated with respect to the appropriate PSICD, MPICD, and LARDP core Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) documents.  The draft ECPs/ICNs will either be incorporated into UAI core documents through formal SJICWG processes, accompanied by completion of quality assurance checklists by affected programs, or will otherwise be refined during follow on, full development efforts to address and incorporate these interfaces into UAI.

Technical Objective:  Contractor(s) shall define a protocol for achieving rapid, low cost integration of weapons onto aircraft by decoupling the integration from the aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) update cycles.  Technical characteristics of the UAI protocol and the documents defining it shall be as follows:
–	UAI must be capable of being implemented on legacy aircraft and maintain compatibility of legacy stores.
–	UAI will not impose a common operating system across legacy aircraft or weapons.
–	UAI will not require an upload of an OFP.
–	For full UAI functionality, the aircraft must have ability to communicate with stores using a MIL-STD-1553 protocol, without violating the MIL-STD-1760 requirements for the use of standard messages.
–	Modification of existing stores to be compatible with UAI is allowed.
–	Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) will be used as the UAI mission planning baseline system.
–	The LAR efforts within SJICWG support shall include creation of a stand alone UAI LAR requirements document which may be included or referenced contractually in programs which choose to implement UAI compliant LAR algorithms.  Document created as part of the LARDP development efforts shall be used as a baseline in generating this requirements document. 
The core ICDs shall define and document a single set of messages (the “consolidated set”) that meet the requirements above.  These ICDs shall incorporate interface requirements and growth features to accommodate foreseeable new weapon interface requirements.  The ICDs will identify the existing weapons ICDs (the “superset”) that are used as baseline requirements in defining the consolidated set.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV)
<SOLNBR>FA8629-06-R-2351
<RESPDATE>063006
<CONTACT>Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-4284, Fax (937) 656-5686, Email Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Special Operations Systems Group (SOFSG), Battlefield Airmen Flight (BA) seeks to acquire and field a Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit’s need for real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach as technology matures and funding becomes available through the POM cycle.  The objective for Block 0 is for the delivery of specification compliant systems IAW the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products, and execution of the associated program support.  At a minimum, the system shall meet the BATMAV initial screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and Airworthiness Requirements.  The objective for further blocks is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology insertion.

SOFSG plans to issue formal RFP Number FA8629-06-R-2351 for the BATMAV system on or about 30 May 2006, with proposals due on or about 30 June 2006.  The procurement will be a small business set-aside.  The Government anticipates the requirement for BATMAV will be approximately 314 systems for the primary customer.  (30 in FY07, 75 in FY08, 116 in FY09 and 93 in FY10)However, the contract is being structured on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity basis, so that other interested customers can also use this vehicle to purchase the system.  The initial delivery order will include the necessary integration effort for the Block 0 system (FY06 funding).  Options for production, training and sustainment will also be placed on the initial delivery order for execution after production and operations funds become available in FY07.  Thirty (30) systems are required for the initial delivery order.

Utilizing the Best Value approach, the government will consider innovative or individualized solutions to meeting the system and program requirements.  However, the contractor is encouraged to provide representative systems as rapidly as possible.  To this end, a system demonstration will be included as part of the source selection, in order to determine each offeror's baseline capability.  It is anticipated that the contractor will provide the fastest practical schedule and an alternate schedule which would accommodate additional customers.  

The proposed system shall consist of the following basic components: 
Ground Control Station (GCS) (1 per system)
Air Vehicle (AV)(2 per system)
AV Payload 
Field Repair Kit 
any equipment required for flight preparation, launch or recovery

R.J. TOKARZMEDICAL IMAGING RADIATION SAFETY CORP.
44 STELTON ROAD, STE 115
PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854-2663

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires the services to design, develop, pilot test, evaluate, and offer a fundamental course on basic radiation physics that includes modules specific to radiological health areas as specified 

Background:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the responsibility of implementing the radiological health program based on the plan signed by the Center for Devices and Radiological  Health (CDRH) Director in May 2005.  One of the goals outlined in the plan involved providing meaningful and appropriate training to FDA and State inspectors to properly, efficiently, and effectively perform surveys of medical diagnostic products (e.g., mammography, diagnostic radiographic and fluoroscopic systems with long-term inclusion of other medical and non-medical radiation products.

The ultimate goal of this order is to provide comprehensive, online training for FDA and State personnel in the fundamental concepts of basic x-ray health radiation physics with additional modules covering instruction in specific diagnostic radiation systems to allow FDA to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities in monitoring these radiation-emitting devices.

Scope of Work:

FDA is requesting the expansion of the existing online training to capitalize on the user-friendly format, the fundamental basic radiation information contained in the currently used training, and the expertise previously tapped to develop this training. This task involves the development and expansion of online training to include a number of modules specific to x-ray radiological health areas prioritized by FDA after it conducts a full needs assessment of radiological health training needs.
 
The contractor will preserve the content and format of the original online training and continue to make available to FDA-approved student nominations. Instruction will be delivered through on-line and CD-ROM methodology through modules, visuals, demonstrations, exercises and laboratory sessions providing and preparing the students with knowledge and expertise to progress to the next appropriate level as required.  Helpdesk and maintenance support will be provided as well throughout the duration of the project.



Deliverables

In designing, developing, testing, evaluating, and implementing the broadened training, the contractor will complete the following tasks with the overall goal of creating and offering additional modules in basic radiation systems to include those areas mentioned above, as appropriate:

FY 06:
•	Submit a timeline for training design, development, testing, and implementation thereof, including deliverables 
•	Initiate required instruction on basic radiology physics to include specified basic radiation materials for the basic x-ray field testing course specific to FDA “for cause” survey requirements) (Module 1)
•	Provide helpdesk/maintenance support 
•	Preserve the module and offer to FDA-approved registrants

FY 06:	
•	Complete development of Module 1 
•	Pilot test/evaluate/modify Module  
•	Present final Module 1 product  ( Date to be specified by Project Officer)
•	Offer module 1 online NLT (Date to be specified by Project Officer)
•	Cover registrations for up to 30 FDA and state students*

*over the duration of the period of performance

•	Initiate the design/ development of Module 2 (above-table radiographic (AR) x-ray field inspections) 
•	Provide helpdesk/maintenance support 


The FDA views any newly developed and expanded online training to be unique, no longer specific to MQSA, and the property of the Agency for its use as appropriate.  As the contractor develops these new training modules, he may offer it to the public at large, charging an enrollment fee and providing course materials and maintenance and hotline support as needed.

The FDA will perform the following tasks:
•	Review/accept deliverables list and due dates
•	Provide the contractor with course materials/outlines specific to each radiation modality and regulatory requirements, as appropriate
•	Review, test, and provide feedback to the contractor on modules as appropriate
•	Accept modules 
•	Provide the contractor with names of subject matter experts
•	Provide the contractor with names of FDA-approved student nominations
•	Pre-test developed materials before going online for access by FDA-approved student nominations


Period of Performance:

Beginning August 1, 2006 and ending on September 30, 2007

Qualifications:
 
Since 2002, Tokarz Imaging, Inc. has provided FDA with an online basic radiological course specific to mammography equipment.  As the leading expert on the content of the existing online mammography training, he understands our targeted audiences, their needs, our goals in training these audiences, and the time frames associated with offering this training.  His sustained quality performance has provided students with a resource to ask questions regarding the course materials and the use of the software used for this online instruction. 

Over the past several years, Tokarz Imaging, Inc., has designed, developed, tested, evaluated, modified, and implemented an online radiological health course that can provide instruction to FDA and State inspectors through distance learning in the fundamental concepts of radiation health physics.  FDA has maintained a relationship with the contractor whereby Tokarz Imaging, Inc., revises and supports the course materials as needed to accommodate feedback from students and changes in our program, as warranted, and provides helpdesk assistance for questions that surface from accessing this training.
Therefore, Tokarz Imaging, Inc.  has extensive experience and knowledge of the our online training system and demonstrates a unique capability to perform the required services with no learning curve, Additionally, to obtain these services from another vendor with similar knowledge and experience or to train a vendor with less experience and knowledge would take significantly more effort and would be more costly on the part of the government.  

Evaluation Criteria will be based on the qualifications and requirements as stated above.

This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the service specified in this notice may identify their interest and respond to the requirements by submitting their response to the below address.    All responses will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis.  The quotation must reference the Solicitation number FDA-1019257.  The government reserves the right to issue an award without further notice.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a requirement for technical assistance in the development and operation of the NIOSH Mobile Engine Emissions Laboratory at Lake Lynn Laboratory.    
Introduction
The Diesel Research Team at NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) is currently involved in a project to identify and characterize the nanometer and ultrafine aerosols emitted by diesel engines and to evaluate the currently available and emerging control technologies used to reduce the exposure of workers to these particles.. This project is part of larger NIOSH effort to investigate the role of nano-particles in chronic obstructive pulminary disease (COPD) and other occupational diseases. The physical and chemical properties of the nanometer and ultrafine diesel aerosols will be characterized through a series of engine/dynamometer tests both at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory experimental mine (LLL) and at participating active mines. 

This study should provide data to support a better understanding of the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of diesel generated aerosols and to help assess the effects of those aerosols on workers health, particularly on asthma and COPDs. In addition, this study will generate information on the effects of various control technologies on the characteristics of diesel generated aerosols and gases. The information obtained through this research will enable industry to make educated decisions on the proper control technology to be used to reduce exposures of mine workers to diesel generated nanopaticles. Consistent with the NIOSH mission, our innovative research on emissions of nanoparticles from diesel vehicles in the workplace will provide national and world leadership to anticipate, recognize, evaluate, and prevent potential work-related illnesses from a growing use of diesel-powered equipment in occupational settings. The diesel research team will contribute to the NIOSH’s vision of partnership by establishing new and fostering existing partnerships with industry, labor, federal and state governments and scientific and professional communities.

The diesel research team at PRLis currently working on developing the NIOSH Mobile Engine Emissions Laboratory (MEEL) at LLL. This facility offers a unique environment for the field testing of diesel technologies by providing both a real mine environment along with the accuracy, characteristic in emissions laboratories, that is instrumental for research on characterization of combustion generated nanometer and ultrafine aerosols.. The real mine testing environment is important in order to avoid laboratory artifacts and to bridge the gap between inherently inaccurate field results and the unrealistic laboratory experiments.







State-of-the-art instrumentation will be used to characterize particulate matter and gaseous emissions from diesel engines. The Scanning Mobility Particle Size spectrometer, Fast Mobility Particle Size analyzer, and Electrical Low Pressure Impactor will be used to directly measure the size distribution and the number of the diesel aerosols. The chemical composition of these particles will be determined from the collected samples using methods, such as the NIOSH Analytical Method 5040, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry for carbon analysis, high resolution analytical electron microscopy with x-ray diffraction, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for inorganic analysis. A lung deposition model will be used to assess the effects of the control technologies on the potential of ultrafine DPM aerosols to deposit in various regions of the human respiratory tract. To evaluate the biological consequence of size-dependent changes in DPM chemical composition, samples of DPM will be analysis by NIOSH-HELD – Molecular Biophysics Team, using bacterial gene mutation assays, and mammalian cell chromosomal and DNA damage assays. The concentrations of NO and NO2 will be measured using chemiluminescence analyzer. An FTIR will also be used to measure mine air concentrations, of some gaseous pollutants, such as CO2 emitted by the diesel engine.

Need for assistance
The Team currently needs assistance for the installation, commissioning, calibration and operation of selected specialized aerosol and gaseous measurement instrumentation. The help is also needed for developing and establishing standard operating procedures and conducting experimental work. In addition assistance is needed to ensure the stability of the ventilation in the D-drift of LLL and the proper mixing of the diesel emissions. The need is immediate. 

Requirements
The contractor is required to demonstrate technical knowledge and skills for the setting up, calibration, and operation of laboratory instrumentation used to measure diesel emissions. In addition the contractor should demonstrate experience with operating and calibrating similar instrumentation. The contractor should also demonstrate the ability to master a variety of the aforementioned instrumentation and measurement systems and perform tasks including installation, set-up, calibration and operation. Ideally, the candidate should be familiar with emissions measurement equipment found and used in the operation of a diesel engine test cell used for research purposes.

IMPORTANT:  The contractor will be required to be present at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory, located 50 miles south of Pittsburgh, PA and 15 miles north east of Morgantown, WV, on a daily basis, i.e. on a normal work schedule. The contractor will be required to work in an underground environment.



The work will be conducted under the general direction of the researchers from the NIOSH PRL diesel research team.  No solicitation is available; however, interested parties may request a copy of the Statement of Work including deliverables. 
 
Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Margaret L. Mooney, Reference MLM000HCC24-2006-35560, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236,  MMooney@cdc.gov.

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the West Virginia University, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.  The two primary reasons for selecting this entity to perform the work are 1) the specialized experience and technical expertise of advanced graduate students and professionals working there, and 2) the proximity of the contractor’s facility to the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory that enables project personnel to work at the Lake Lynn Laboratory on a daily basis for extended periods of time.  This is an essential requirement for the NIOSH work effort.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source contract to BAE Systems of Greenlawn, NY 11740 for procurement of AN/VRC-99B(C) radios that will be used in the testing and deployment of the AN/WLD-1 (V) 1 Remote Minehunting System. The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio is used as part of the communications subsystem used to control the Remote Minehunting Vehicle (RMV). It is part of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) link hardware that is used to control the RMV at ranges up to 14 nautical miles.  The items being purchased are: Part Name - , Manufacturer Part No. 1051054G-4, Quantity four (4) each with options for the purchase of up to four (4) additional radios.  The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio, manufactured by BAE Systems, was competitively chosen at the beginning of the RMS development program by the prime development contractor and the data link subsystem (DLS) was subsequently designed and tested around it for LOS operations.  This radio is an integrated !  part of the RMS DLS subsystem and is uniquely capable of operating with the existing hardware and software already designed into the system. Specific commands for remote, automatic operation of the radio are incorporated into the existing system, requiring the identical radio for plug-and-play operation. Other radio features that are required for RMS operations include: Embedded encryption approved for SECRET level data transmission, operation in the 1.7 - 2.0 GHz radio frequency band used by the military, data rates up to 3.15 Mbps, and automatic network establishment of at least three radios. There are no other radio(s) currently built that have such features and can operate with RMS off-the-shelf.  This is a follow-on contract for the production of a highly specialized equipment within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of items being acquired!  , would not be recovered through competition.  Delivery will be to the  Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Central and Eastern European Renal Cell (RCC) Cancer Study with The University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The NCI DCEG conducts epidemiologic research of disease etiology as it relates to occupational and environmental exposures.  A major component of the research agenda is focused on kidney cancer.  A major goal of the Central and Eastern European RCC Study is to explain an excess in kidney cancer incidence that has been observed in Central Europe for several decades.  In addition to the epidemiologic portion of this study, the NCI has the opportunity to conduct a genetic study of tumor tissue from cases enrolled in the study.  The purpose of this procurement is to: 1) Confirm histology of frozen biopsy material, 2) Report on other pathologic information that is important to the Central and Eastern European RCC Case-Control Study and will be used in analyses and 3) Identify areas to macrodissect and oversee DNA and RNA extraction of these tissue.  Contractor shall: 1) Determine the type and usability of tumor tissue on the slide which is representative of the biopsy, 2) Remove sections of tumor material that are not usable tumor, 3) Cut additional sections for DNA and RNA extraction, 4) Oversee RNA/DNA extraction by trained personnel and, 5) Quantitate sample and determine quality using 260/280 OD ratio. 


The tumor panel described in this project is an expansion of 200 tumor samples previously extracted and analyzed at The University of California San Francisco Cancer Center. These samples are an extension of an ongoing partially funded NCI grant RO1CA102600 entitled “Renal Cancer Risk Factors and Genomic Alterations.” It is important for scientific comparability of analytic results to work with the University of California for this study.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the research already in progress. 

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on August 1, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-60105-NG.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intend to issue a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to 
Mr. Dennis Gehley and Associates, 6901 Barnack Drive, Springfield, VA., 22152, to provide evaluation support for the Health disparities and Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRN) project.
  

The sole source determination is based upon  Mr. Dennis Gehley and Associates (DGA) 30 years of experience in evaluation design, data management, and statistical analysis, working on complex evaluation research studies to improve federal programs.  DGA has expertise in a broad range of formative and summative evaluation strategies, including application of the integrative standardized case study method to evaluation of complex federal programs.  There experience with telephone surveys, structured and semi-structured interview, budget and financial analysis, and the development of the specific performance measures for assessing complex federal programs in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as well as other federal agencies.  DGA, will support two major evaluation projects as mention in the above paragraph.  The methodology employs specific standardized procedures and protocols for case study site visits, followed by structured content analysis.  Both evaluation studies are prospective in design, and the first project, the evaluation of NIDCR’s health disparities program has been ongoing for several years.  In order to maintain comparability with the longitudinal data previously collected, it is necessary to continue using the integrative standardized case study method of data collection for the follow-up for the study.  Due to Mr. Gehely and Associates prior experience with evaluation methodology he will not need additional training and can support the project quickly, enabling  NIDCR, to complete this evaluation in the time frame available to inform development of a new Request for Application (RFA) related to the oral health disparities program. Another strong qualification is his in-depth knowledge of biomedical research.  An award to any other source would affect the Institute’s anticipated outcome based upon Mr. Gehely and Associates experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.

Period of Performance:  The project is expected to require an estimated 820 man hours during the period of performance  July  2006 through July  2007.  

Background: 
The mission of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research is to improve oral, dental and Craniofacial health of all Americans through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information.  Organization:  Key components of the NIDCR organizational structure, including those with major involvement in this task order, are described below.  The Office of Science Policy and Analysis, located in the Office of the Director, develops and coordinates science policy and program planning and evaluation for the Institute.  The Office’s activities include: (1) research agenda development, science priority setting, strategic planning, science policy briefings, and special planning efforts on specific research issues or initiatives; (2) liaison with government, academic and private sector planning, evaluation, science policy, legislative, and survey agencies and organizations; (3) development, maintenance and updating of the Institute’s scientific coding system; (4) design and prepare reports on NIDCR scientific programmatic and funding activities; and (5) development, conduct and coordination of program evaluation and assessment activities, including assessment of the content, significance, and effectiveness of NIDCR research, research training and science transfer/health promotion programs. Extramural research at NIDCR is organized into four (4) centers that are responsible for planning, developing, reviewing, funding, and managing research, research training and career development supported by grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. These divisions are the Center for Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases, the Center for Clinical Research, the Center for Health Promotion and Behavioral Research, and the Center for Biotechnology and Innovation.  NIDCR overall evaluation efforts involve all of these centers, however, the oral health disparities program and the Practice-based Research Network programs are both located in the Center for Clinical Research.      Specific Programs Being Evaluated:  NIDCR is conducting evaluations of two key programs:  (1) the research program in oral health disparities; and (2) the program for dental Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs).  The research program in oral health disparities responds to the growing awareness that despite improvements in some oral health status indicators over the past several decades, the burden of disease is not evenly distributed across all segments of society.  The program supports research that explores the multiple and complex factors that may determine oral, dental, and Craniofacial health in disadvantaged and undeserved populations.  To address the research needs in this area, all types of clinical research are necessary, including epidemiological studies, behavioral studies and interventions, controlled clinical trials, and community-based studies.  Novel interventions as well as more established prevention and treatment methods need to be studied, and methodological research is also needed.  The research program in oral health disparities includes both small, short-term grants and five large, longer-term Centers for Research to Reduce Health Disparities.  The Centers is an especially important portion of the program; in addition to conducting disparities research, the centers are designed to serve as a national resource for investigators interested in health disparities research and to provide training and career opportunities in health disparities research.  The program for Dental Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs) was established in March 2005, when NIDCR awarded three seven-year grants to establish practice-based research networks that investigate with greater scientific rigor everyday issues in the delivery of oral healthcare. The impetus behind the networks is the frequent lack of research data to guide treatment decisions in dental practice.  Each regional network will conduct approximately 15 to 20 short-term clinical studies over the next seven years, comparing the benefits of different dental procedures, dental materials, and prevention strategies under a range of patient and clinical conditions.  The networks also will perform anonymous chart reviews, as allowed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), to generate data on disease, treatment trends, and the prevalence of fewer common oral conditions.   Evaluation Research Designs:  Both the health disparities and PBRN evaluations have completed a design phase, and study protocols are in place or being developed.  Each of these evaluation research studies uses a mixed-method design and is conducted on a prospective (rather than retrospective) basis.  The health disparities evaluation began in 2002, and the program has been followed and data collected over the past four years.  As part of this evaluation, baseline site visits to the Centers for Research to Address Oral Health Disparities were conducted in 2003, and follow-up visits are planned for 2006.  The PBRN evaluation began in 2006, and baseline site visits are planned for late 2006 and/or early 2007.  One of the most important evaluation methods used in each of these projects is the integrative standardized case study method.  This methodology employs specific standardized procedures and protocols for case study site visits, followed by structured content analysis using the methods originally outlined by Jauch et al.   In addition, both of the evaluation studies employ bibliometrics, budget review, and other quantitative methods.  

Objective:
The objective of this Task Order is to perform specific tasks to support NIDCR’s prospective evaluations on two programs:  (1) oral health disparities research; and (2) dental practice-based research networks.  Each of these evaluations employs multiple methods to assess the program’s progress in meeting its specific objectives and in contributing to NIDCR’s overall mission.  The evaluation contractor will support both research projects by serving on the team conducing integrative standardized case studies for centers funded by each program, by supporting qualitative and quantitative analysis from the studies, and by consulting and advising NIDCR staff on interpretation and presentation of the research findings.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

As a matter of urgency, the German Government will pre-finance works in support of the expansion of the German Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) contingent of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) based in Mazar-E-Sharif, Afghanistan. The German Government is requesting additional infrastructure procurement measures to finalize the re-structuring of the Northern Region and build-up and effective Forward Support Base (FSB) in the area, both of which are time-critical issues.

As part of the detailed planning work required for achieving full operational capability (FOC), the German Government intends to award multiple contracts, within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on up to eight (8) specific civil works projects for which Germany is serving as the Host Nation. The estimated value of this project is 11.6 million EUR ($14.8 million USD).

In addition, the German Government has been granted permission from the NATO Infrastructure Committee to be exempted from International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in order to advertise these civil works under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) plus procedure, thus allowing for individual contracts can be awarded to local Afghan firms. The Germans feel this way of proceeding will guarantee a timely implementation of work, while avoiding problems associated with contract award to a major contractor, especially in Afghanistan. Contract award to local firms allows direct influence to be exercised and avoid the often time-consuming entry formalities. In addition, the involvement of local firms offers the possibility to react swiftly to unforeseeable circumstances while, at the same time, enhancing acceptance by the local population which again serves the purpose of stabilizing the security situation of the northern region. Thus, they expect the stronger involvement of local trade and industry in contract award to have a stabilizing effect on the security situation.

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is unknown at this time. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-ISAF-GERMANY-FSB-MAZA-2006.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The works and their estimated costs include the following:

1. Signal Centre with antenna field (2nd construction phase) - 5.0 million EUR
2. Build-up of recreational installations including sports facilities - 3.0 million EUR
3. IT/FM cabling with civil works - 2.0 million EUR
4. Patrol path - 1.0 million EUR
5. Water supply for fire fighting purposes - 0.2 million EUR
6. Waste collection point and recycling/disposal - 0.2 million EUR
7. Preparation of the working field for washing facilities (ground work, supply lines, sewage pipes, etc.) - 0.1 million EUR
8. Weather station - 0.1 million EUR

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 

ESTIMATED DATES OF COMPLETION

1. Signal Centre with antenna field (2nd construction phase): September 2006

2. Build-up of recreational installations including sports facilities: February 2007 

3. IT/Telefone cabling with civil works: September 2006

4. Patrol path: September 2006

BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06
	2.  Questions from Contractor	s				25 April – 12 May 06

<DESC>The Federal Government is seeking information regarding potential sources of supply for Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) (or “managed services”) for wireless products and services.  This is a market research effort being conducted in order to determine industry capabilities and industry robustness.  This is neither a procurement announcement nor a guarantee that a procurement will be conducted in the future.  A solicitation is not available at this time. Additionally, there is no guarantee or commitment by the Federal Government that a solicitation will be created as a result of this announcement. Any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. If you would like to be emailed an electronic version of this announcement in MS Word format, please send a request to the contracting officer listed below.

The Government values Industry input.  Accordingly, responses to this announcement are greatly appreciated.

Executive Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum on May 20, 2005, entitled “Implementing Strategic Sourcing” mandating that federal agencies leverage spending as much as possible. (see www.caoc.gov)
	
On November 16, 2005, the General Services Administration and the Department of Treasury launched the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI).  The purpose of the initiative is to: (1) Test the ability to strategically source across federal agencies; (2) Share best practices and build the strategic sourcing community of practice; (3) Learn lessons applicable to future strategic sourcing efforts at the federal or agency levels; (4) Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in responding to the OMB Strategic Sourcing Initiative.

FSSI is chartered under the purview of the Chief Acquisition Officer’s Council and the Strategic Sourcing Working Group, both of which are monitored by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy within OMB.  The Wireless Handheld Devices and Services commodity team (one of five under FSSI) includes representation from at least fourteen (14) federal departments and/or agencies, all of whom have agreed through a formal project charter to participate in the pilot in some capacity.

The primary objectives of the Wireless commodity team are to: (1) Establish a common procurement vehicle through which all Government agencies may procure and utilize wireless services; (2) Lower the total costs associated with wireless services while maintaining industry service levels; and (3) Utilize business intelligence to better support overall decision making and performance management.  

Purpose

The purpose of this Sources Sought (SS) is to gather sufficient information to assist in the decision making process of how to fulfill the Government's requirement to establish a common contracting arrangement to maintain agency information technology wireless programs to include, but not limited to, the acquisition of cellular devices [i.e. Cellular Phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Blackberries, and Cellular Network Cards], cellular services, and the management of program requirements. It is contemplated that the scope of the contracting arrangement (should one be created) would cover ALL Government agencies.

FSSI Team:

The team assembled to accomplish this OMB directive consists of fourteen agencies with an estimated 200,000 wireless devices.  The number of Government wide devices that may require service is unknown, but substantial.  The Government makes no guarantee regarding the number of devices that may require services in the future.  

Requirements:

If a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that it would require future Offerors to be able to propose a full managed services solution that supports procurement of wireless devices and services (local, regional, nationwide and International) through deployment, transfer, collection, engineering, management, operation, and disposal of wireless voice and data services for the Government.  A potential Offeror would likely be required to provide all program management services and support to the Government in administrating its programs.

The Government would require the flexibility to purchase or lease wireless services and equipment and pay only for actual minutes used for in-service/activated cellular devices.  

Additionally, if a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that the procurement would be conducted as a small business set aside if market research indicates that a sufficient industry base exists.

<CONTACT>Sharon A Delp, Contracting Officer, Phone (281) 483-4239, Fax (281) 483-9632, Email sharon.a.delp@nasa.gov
<DESC>Johnson Space Center (JSC) proposes to obtain authority contract by other than full and open competition for acquisition of support to the Constellation Program under the current NAS 9-20000 Space Flight Operations Contract (SFOC)  The support is planned to continue under the SFOC follow-on contract, the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) NNJ06VA01C, which will be awarded no later than October 1, 2006.    It is anticipated that the award of this capability, in the form of an ordering provision, will be via modification to the SFOC within the next few weeks.  The SPOC will be awarded as a sole source procurement under a Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approved on September 13, 2004 to United Space Alliance (USA); and it is anticipated SPOC would contain a similar ordering provision for Constellation work.  The period of performance for this effort under the SPOC will end September 30, 2010. This action is being taken pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, to allow the Agency and the Constellation program sufficient time to strategically develop requirements for the new program and plan acquisition strategies for meeting those requirements.  It is anticipated that the majority of those requirements will be competitive.  Such requirements may include, concept development and trade analyses for flight operations trajectory planning, mission planning, development, integration and execution, and facilities and applications software planning; ground systems operations, maintenance and modification; vehicle processing, test and recovery operations; assembly and physical integration of Constellation test flight elements; mission preparation and planning, human spaceflight training, operations integration, operations application development; systems and cargo engineering and integration support to Constellation Program architecture studies associated with Shuttle derived launch vehicles; and general Constellation studies. This effort is planned to be awarded through delivery orders placed under the SFOC, and its successor contract, SPOC.   Using USA to meet short term and interim requirements of the Constellation Program, is consistent with the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 09-155).  NASA’s Human Capital Plan, required by section 502(c) of the Act, specifically addresses the use of existing contractor workforce in the transition process.  While some segments of this work could potentially be done by another contractor, the potential for cost, schedule and technical risk during this time period is significant.	Similar requirements are currently performed under SFOC/SPOC, and USA is the only known source with the wide range of unique skills, analytical capabilities and expertise developed over many years to provide the required support to Constellation that is available immediately without additional training or cost.  Given that Constellation has made the decision to use Shuttle-derived technology in its program, there will be a strong commonality of operations and hardware between the two programs.  USA is in a unique position to provide these services rapidly, and award to USA minimizes the risk to the completion of the shuttle program by 2010 and minimizes the risk of impacting the early Constellation Test Flight Program.  Competition at this time is impractical, as there is no other company positioned to almost immediately begin Constellation work related to Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS).	 All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  All companies interested in subcontracting should contact USA directly. Place of Contract Performance:	Johnson Space Center, Houston Texas; Kennedy Space Center, Orlando Florida; Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville Alabama. This acquisition will not be Set-aside. NO Faxes will be accepted. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH.  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is in the process of conducting market research for Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).  SOFSA is a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) industrial operation comprised of facilities and equipment in several locations headquartered in Lexington, KY.  SOFSA is tasked to provide logistics support focused on SOF and SOF-peculiar equipment.  Selected non-SOF work is accepted on a non-interference basis.  SOFSA operations encompass the entire spectrum of logistics support including repair, modification, maintenance management, life cycle support and sustainment for the ever-changing, joint SOF mission.  SOFSA supports USSOCOM, its component commands, its subordinate elements, others of the Department of Defense and elements of other agencies that support USSOCOM missions. The Government has decided to initiate market research to have a better understanding of the current market, trends and solutions available in support of this activity. Questions have been developed to solicit best practices from industry both DoD-based and non-DoD commercial businesses.  These questions, as well as a description of SOFSA’s core capabilities are posted on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website.  FedTeDS is an E-Gov initiative in the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) designed to safeguard sensitive acquisition related information.   The link to the SOFSA Market Research Questions and SOFSA core capabilities on FedTeDS is: https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=MARKETRESEARCHSOFSA2006    

Please visit the FEDTEDS website and submit a request to access these documents.  The main goal of this market research is to gain knowledge on the market, look at lessons learned, and different methods of performance metrics from entities having experience implementing solutions for programs similar in size, scope and complexity as SOFSA.   Take note that this is not to be used to promote new business development or marketing pitches from Industry, but as a beneficial tool to improve the Government’s understanding of current industry practices, including best practices, industry capabilities, innovative approaches, service levels, and performance strategies and measures.  Responses are due NLT 1700 EST on 28 July 2006.  Based on responses and information derived from the market research questions, the Government will schedule one-on-one meetings with the companies.  If there is interest in participating in this market research or any questions, please contact the POCs identified in this synopsis notice.  This is not a request for proposal and no proposal will be entertained at this time. The POC for this action is: Mr. Randy Molten, Deputy Director, SOFSA, (859) 566-1566. Responses to this synopsis and market research questions may be sent in electronic format to contracting@socom.mil.  The subject line of the email should read “SOFSA Market Research Response” followed by your company name.  Mailing the responses via postal will not be honored.

<DESC>Description - This is a sources sought notice for FR improvements to the ACU (FR ACU).  Consideration will be given to all types of FR performance improvements to the ACU, including chemical treatments, blends, fibers and fabrics.  The FR ACU should exhibit improved flame resistance while maintaining the current field performance characteristics and fabric performance specifications as specified in the current ACU cloth specification, MIL-DTL-44436A (Class 8 ) including UCP printing and wrinkle free f inish.  UCP pattern and color shall be matched according to Section 3.4.1.3 (Class 8) of MIL-DTL-44436A. Participation Requirements - Vendors that submit responsible and responsive replies to this notice will be considered as successful past performers in future PM CIE FR ACU program solicitations. To be considered for this notice, source must submit technical information and test data explaining both the composition of their materials and the performance expectations of the material as described in the Additional Participation Requirements section b elow.   ACUs should be manufactured according to the design outlined in FQ/PD 04-04A and FQ/PD 04-05A.  Findings do not need to be FR and finding color does not matter for this notice.  Although UCP printing is required, print will only be evaluated for t he purpose of colorfastness and flammability.  Source must have in use a Quality System that conforms to the ISO 9001:2000 requirements.   Additional Participation Requirements - Source must submit 6, unwashed, Medium Regular (MR) ACU sets complete with labels stating manufacturer and fabric composition/identification, along with 5 linear yards of fabric for FR and/or physical evaluation. Source must submit the following key test results as specified in MIL-DTL-44436A (Class 8) as well as After Flame, After Glow, and Char Length results from the Vertical Flammability test as specified in ASTM D6413.  Vertical Flammability results should be submitted both before and after 25 launderings (AATCC-96 Vic): Weight, Breaking Strength, Tearing Strength, Fabric Appearance, Dimensional Stability, Colorfastness to laundering, and Visual Shade Match (paragraph 3.4.3). Source must also submit documentation as specified in Paragraph 4.4.2.1 of MIL-DTL-44436A specifically including all appropriate MSDS information. Source must submit a cost per square yard of fabric and cost per 1000 ACUs. Source must submit a statement reflecting Berry compliance status.  Non-compliance does not exclude items from consideration. Source must submit a description of the quality system. Source must submit all required items NLT 15 August 2006. Evaluation Process - All submitted ACUs will be inspected to ensure compliance with the referenced design specification. Items will then be ranked according to the following weighted formula. 	All laboratory results  50% 	Cost  50% The top eight sources will then be evaluated on the instrumented manikin as indicated below. Three of the six ACUs will be laundered once and the other three will be laundered 25 times. All six ACUs will be evaluated for burn injury prediction (with standard cotton undergarments) according to ASTM D1930-00 on an instrumented manikin using a 4 second, 2 cal/sq. cm-sec, simulated flash fire exposure condition. Further laboratory evaluations may be performed using the five yards of submitted fabric.  These tests would be preformed on all manikin tested items.  Examples of additional tests that may be performed are: Abrasion Resistance, Wickability, Total Heat Loss, Thermal Protective Performance, Thermal Shrinkage. Items will then be ranked according to the following weighted formula.

ITEM DESCRIPTION:

Quantity    	Description     				
1 Ea		Telescope Controller
		
NAICS Code:  333314

2.  This is a SOLE SOURCE acquisition to DFM Engineering, Inc., a small business.  The Telescope Controller will be used in teaching cadets at the United States Air Force Academy in Physics 215, 370, 371 and 480.  The Physics Dept. uses the telescope in the observatory to demonstrate basic principles of physics to core cadets, as well as instructing cadets in advanced Physics classes on the uses of telescopes for remote sensing, satellite identification, and deep space observation.  In order to achieve these goals, the Physics Dept. needs to upgrade the control system which points the telescopes.  The current motors, gimbals, mounting and slow motion controls are still in good working order; however, the automated control system which runs the mechanical pieces of the USAFA telescope needs to be replaced.  The current control system only runs on the oldest computer at USAFA and cannot be upgraded to a newer computer system.  The new upgraded control system should include a hand-held paddle, a user friendly control system allowing the user to point to any astronomical object in the sky.  This control system will consist of a personal computer running Windows XP, a commercial software package, and a motor drive chassis to provide mechanical linkage to the current stepper motors on the telescope.  This new control system will provide the ability for a user to create custom user interface.  Control electronics must be able to be located up to 150 feet from the telescope for remote control of the telescope.  A built in library of objects in the sky to include stars, planets, comets, and satellites must also be provided in this control system.  In addition, this system must provide operation and display with any astronomical epoch; hybrid digital/analog servo controllers with zero position error integrator.  Controller and pointing model must achieve 10 to 20 arc second blind pointing to a 60 degree zenith distance; a single DC servo motor per axis for connection to the telescope, hand-held paddles must include guide, set, slew focus and dome left right commands;  a system control for a focus stepper motor with potentiometer as the position sensor; Mercury limit switch to prevent telescope over-travel; gold plated electrical connectors for long electronics lifetime and full wiring schematics provided with system to allow for maintenance.   This controller will be used in conjunction with the USAFA Observatory telescopes.  The upgraded telescope control system consists of Part Number WinTCS-006ST Advanced Telescope Controller with interconnect cables to the existing Motor Driver Chassis (MDC), software, installation, checkout, operator training, and documentation.  This upgrade also includes Satellite tracking capability.  The US Government [through the USAF Academy] has an agreement to Restricted Data Rights for the drawings and the software for the telescope and the control system with DFM Engineering, Inc.  As such, DFM Engineering, Inc. is the only source capable of meeting the Government’s requirement.  This Notice of Proposed Contract Action is the only solicitation submitted for this requirement.  No formal solicitation will be issued prior to award.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  It should be noted that faxed quotations will be accepted.  The faxed quotation can be sent to (719)333-9103.

•	Prepare CMS’ case for presentation at the arbitration hearing, including identification of and arrangement for witnesses, interpreters (if needed), etc.
•	Attend and represent CMS at the hearing, presenting evidence and argument to support the Government’s position; including conducting direct examination of witnesses for each party.
•	If necessary, submit additional documents, other evidence or additional memoranda of law following the hearing:  (1) upon the arbitrator's request; (2) upon the agreement of the parties; or (3) upon the request of one of the parties with the arbitrator's consent.  These memoranda of law, documents or other evidence shall be filed with the AAA for transmission to the arbitrator within time limits specified by the arbitrator.  
•	Represent CMS at any rehearing if reopening of a hearing is necessary.
•	Arrange for service of any papers, notices, or other documents necessary or proper to be served on the opposing party and its representatives.  
•	Represent CMS in any discussions to settle a case dispute during the course of the arbitration.
•	Review the arbitrator’s award and provide CMS with a summary of the arbitrator’s decision, reasoning (findings of fact and conclusions of law), actions required, and errors that require correction.
•	Represent CMS in requesting correction of any clerical, typographical, or computational errors in the award within 20 days after the transmittal of the award; and responding (within 10 days) to any request by the opposing party (state) for a  correction.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Purchase Order to Rutherford & Chekene
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a purchase order to Rutherford & Cheken, 55 Second Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) to develop content for and subsequently present a seminar for work that closely relates to work that they completed on a contract awarded to them for support of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.

One of the goals of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (P.L. 101-614) is to reduce the number of seismically unsafe buildings in the U.S.  In 1994, the President of the United States issued an executive order (E. O. 12941) to direct Federal agencies to initiate a program of seismic rehabilitation of existing Federal buildings.   In support of this effort, the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC) has developed a handbook to guide Federal agencies in their seismic rehabilitation program of existing buildings.  The technical resources needed to develop the handbook were provided by Rutherford & Cheken under Contract No. SB134104C0018.  To facilitate the implementation of the handbook, an educational seminar is planned for the ICSSC representatives and Federal agency engineers.  Because of Rutherford & Chekene's involvement in the aforementioned contract, they are the only source that NIST is currently aware of that is reasonably available and qualified to perform the requirements of this procurement for which the scope is described below.

Scope of Work

The Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) chairs the ICSSC.  BFRL also chairs a subcommittee under which the seismic rehabilitation handbook was prepared.  In order to implement as expeditiously as possible the use of handbook, ICSSC has planned to hold an educational seminar for Federal agency seismic program managers and engineers.  To meet this need, ICSSC requires a Contractor to develop the seminar material and to conduct the seminar.  This seminar is scheduled to be held in FY 2006.

This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, sources that believe they are qualified and capable of providing the services required for the procurement referenced in the Scope of Work section above may provide a written response to this notice no later than July 24, 2006 to joseph.widdup@nist.gov.  Such response shall clearly and unequivocally demonstrate the source's capability to perform the requirements noted in the Scope of Work section above and demonstrate the source's familiarity with the workings of the ICSSC and particularly with the seismic rehabilitation handbook.  The decision whether to compete this procurement is at the Government's discretion based on detailed capability responses received to this notice.

<DESC>This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that may be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Pro gram.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41facility types.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.

The introduction and use of dual core technology is deemed essential to the successful conduct of the Diversity Visa program as it is the most cost effective means of enabling the Bureau to increase processing speeds by more than 50%. The processors will provide the Oracle SW application with extra caching capabilities and the additional memory will enhance the Bureau’s ability to maintain operational status in the event of unexpected memory failures. In summation, the Dell PowerEdge 2850 w/dual core Intel Xenon processor was judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the Diversity Visa program. The Dell PowerEdge 2850 Server was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW. The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendor’s out years support and maintenance agreements. The Dell PowerEdge 2850 servers are to replace older equipment and must be deployed, installed, configured, tested and integrated in the production environment in time to go live prior to October 4, 2006, the initiation date of the 2008 Diversity Visa program. CA/CST therefore must take physical possession of this HW no later than August 15, 2006. Even if another manufacturer’s server identical to the PowerEdge2850 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, it could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that it would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by October 4, 2006. The servers will be used to support a highly visible and significant Congressionally mandated program and absolutely no slippage can be allowed in its initiation date. The vendor may not substitute any item listed on this order with out prior, written approval from the USDOS Contracting Officer. No other individual is authorized, either verbally or in writing to change part numbers, manufacturer, quantity, delivery dates, or any other specification of this RFQ. Items that do not confirm to descriptions and part numbers found in this RFQ will be rejec 0044 ted at the time of delivery causing a return at the vendors expense. Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order.

Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.

Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.

The contractor agrees that the total actual cost may be deducted from the invoiced amount prior to payment.  An estimate of the cost for the Coast Guard to correct noted deficiencies will be provided at the time the contractor is notified of any noncompliance’s.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.  Tracebility means that the awardee must be able to show a clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part, from the OEM to the final vendor.

U. S. COAST GUARD HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	BACKGROUND:

The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) Inspection.  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Poor paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have this HU-25 aircraft (CGNR 2133C) commercially painted, for field evaluation.  This solicitation establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.
  


2.0	OBJECTIVE:
            
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center with an onsite paint facility.

The successful bidder shall also provide training, documentation, and other items as stated in the specification s.   3.0	REMOTE RACKING DEVICE The remote power racking device shall be a Eaton brand rackout device Or Approved Equal.  It shall be designed to completely rack out and rack in a DHP-VR  4.0	GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS The Eaton Electrical Remote Power Safety Racking device system provides an innovative means of inserting and removing a power circuit breaker in metal clad and metal enclosed switchgear, while allowing personnel to be outside of the calculated  Arc Flash  danger limits as defined by NFPA 70E.   All breakers being considered for Remote Power Racking must have some method of levering that can be operated by the rotational motion of a drive system (Screw or gear-drive racking).  If one of these type systems d oes not exist, then the breakers and cells must be modified to add one of these levering features before any remote power racking system can be applied.  The Remote Power Racking System may be used with the switchgear door either open or in many cases with  the door closed. The Eaton Remote Power Safety Racking system does not require complex programming that is normally associated with programmable logic controller (PLC) based systems.  This eliminates cumbersome programming (re-programming), extensive training, and the crea tion and modification of torque profiles each time a breaker is moved between different cells.  This also simplifies maintenance.  A few entries into a key pad and the unit is set for operation. It is also much easier to apply and operate than other designs.  Positioning the Remote Power Safety Racking System in front of each cell is as simple as moving a hand truck.  The Remote Power Safety Racking System also has an onboa rd height adjustment system that does not require auxiliary motors for operation.  Height adjustment is fast, easy, and virtually maintenance free.  Many breakers require positive pressure on the levering systems to maintain engagement and must traverse ho rizontally.  This is also a part of the Eaton Remote Power Safety Racking system.  The unit can be used with most low and medium voltage breakers by changing end effectors (adapters).  Only a few minutes are required for the complete racking process. Common construction features shall include: "	Corrosive resistant finish on frames "	Grade 5, yellow zinc-dichromate hardware "	Reversing electric motor drive system "	Motor torque capability of up to 100 ft lbs "	Adjustable mechanical and electric torque limit "	115 Vac operation standard (Optional battery power) "	Automatic end of travel detection and stop with motor mounted encoder "	Pneumatic transport wheels  standard "	Left, right or rear mounted wheels (field convertible) "	Umbilical pendant cable and operators console which includes: o	Momentary insert button o	Momentary remove button  o	Motor run/overload indicator "	Breaker end-effecters/adaptors for specific manufactures breakers (One included as standard) "	End-effecters/adaptors available for all manufacturers breakers "	Electronic instruction book with embedded video training and setup "	Five year standard warranty 5.0	SUBMITTALS Before acceptance of Or Approved Equal bids, submittals must be approved by Jim Simonsen (208-476-1243), Dworshak Dam, North Fork Drive, Ahsahka, ID., 83520.  Submittals include copy of system drawings, manufactures catalog cuts, O&M manual, specificatio n sheets, and warranty. 6.0	WARRANTY Each system shall be covered by a minimum five-year warranty on all parts, labor, and workmanship from factory defects. 7.0	TRAINING Upon delivery of the equipment, a factory authorized service technician will be required to give a minimum one hour hands-on training of the recommended operation, maintenance, and installation of the machines.

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 
BAA No.  06-14 AEDC/PKP
 
This section provides further information on Hypersonics Test and Evaluation Development, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal and proposal abstract formats, and other general information.

The Test and Resource Management Center (TRMC) is selecting its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This announcement in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) constitutes the only solicitation.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to the solicitation.

TRMC is soliciting research proposals in the area on Hypersonics Test and Evaluation Development.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, systems, or methodologies as they apply to Test and Evaluation (T&E).  

TRMC seeks innovative proposals in the hypersonics area that will allow improved test and evaluation of current systems and future systems requiring test and evaluation over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to perform basic research, but to develop subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.  The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  TRMC seeks advances in test and evaluation of hypersonic systems and related T&E technologies which will advance the state of the art beyond today’s science and technology (S&T) testing methodologies to address performance, operability, and durability of hypersonic systems and components.  

A list (not to be considered all-inclusive nor in priority order) of areas that require advances in test and evaluation technologies are:  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The plan for accomplishment of technical goals in support of innovative claims and deliverable production.  Include direct applicability of proposed work to Test and Evaluation.  (In the full proposal, this section should be supplemented by a more detailed plan in Section III.) 

E.  General discussion of other research in this area.  

F.  A clearly defined organization chart for the program team which includes, as applicable:  (1) the programmatic relationship of team members; (2) the unique capabilities of team members, specifically the principle investigator; (3) the task responsibilities of team members; (4) the teaming strategy among the team members; (5) the key personnel along with the amount of effort to be expended by each person during each year.

This form acknowledges that the proposer and subcontractors are aware of their obligation to have all technical reports, papers, and presentations reviewed by DoD prior to release.  This is required to ensure adherence to DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  

Section II  Summary of Proposal 

This section provides an overview of the proposed work as well as an introduction to the associated technical and management issues, and the applicability of the work to test and evaluation of weapons systems.  Further elaboration of all items will be provided in Section III.  

A.  Innovative claims for the proposed research.  This section is the centerpiece of the proposal and should succinctly describe the uniqueness and benefits of the proposed approach relative to the current state-of-the-art and alternate approaches.  

B.  Deliverables associated with the proposed research and the plans and capability to accomplish technology transition and commercialization.  Include in this section all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, intellectual property, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototype.  If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.  

C.  Cost, schedule, and milestones for the proposed research, including estimates of cost for each task in each year of the effort, total cost, and company cost share.  

D.  Technical rationale, technical approach, and constructive objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.  This technology is anticipated for the Aerodynamic Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) facility at AEDC, however concepts that can be applied to other hypersonic test facilities will be considered.  4) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF HYPERSONIC NOZZLE FLOWS.  In most hypersonic ground test facilities the test gas is energized in a plenum, expanded in a nozzle and then presented to a test article in a test chamber.  It is recognized that energy modes and gas species vary from an isentropic flow process in the rapidly expanding flow.  While the test gas is unlikely to duplicate the flight condition, knowledge of its composition will assist in interpretation of test data.  This effort seeks measurement and modeling of facility flow parameters with the intent of applying the results to a variety of hypersonic facility flows.  5) EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR HYPERSONIC SEPARATION DYNAMICS.  It is expected that next-generation hypersonic weapon systems will employ some type of armament/munitions separation during an aerodynamic maneuver from a carrier vehicle in hypersonic atmosphere flight.  A vast store of subsonic aircraft armament/munitions separation information is available.  Some hypersonic work was accomplished for the space shuttle separation issues several decades ago.  The objective of this solicitation is to investigate and identify flight phenomena incurred during body separation with the goal of simulating the environment with aerodynamic models in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a Captive Trajectory System (CTS).  Research in this topic should use the current state-of-the-art as a starting point and define those things that need to be improved or developed (e.g. dynamic force balance sensitivity to rapidly changing loads as the two-body shock-induced flow fields interact).

TRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations.  In addition, the leveraging of current S&T program developments is highly encouraged.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan.  A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). 

Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  While TRMC will not actively participate in the teaming of project partners, potential proposers are encouraged to examine the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) member sites to acquaint themselves with the scope of test facilities and capabilities within the purview of Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  
The DOT&E/Resources and Ranges website for the MRTFB map and links is http://www.dote.osd.mil/rr/mrtfb.html.  

SUBMISSION PROCESS 

Proposers are REQUIRED to submit a proposal abstract in advance of a full proposal.  This procedure is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review.  The date for submission of proposal abstracts is specified in the FedBizOpps announcement.  Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) will acknowledge receipt of the submission and assign a control number that should be used in all future correspondence regarding the proposal abstract and proposal. 

TRMC will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to propose or not propose and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  TRMC will attempt to review proposal abstracts within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt and will allow proposers at least thirty (30) calendar days after review of their proposal abstracts in order to complete and submit their full proposals.  Regardless of the recommendation, the decision to propose is the responsibility of the proposer.  All submitted proposals will be fully reviewed regardless of the disposition of the proposal abstract.  

Proposers will be notified of acceptance or rejection within 30 days of receipt of the full proposal.  However, those proposals not initially selected will be kept on file until 30 September 2007.  In the event that the T&E/S&T program budget allocation for hypersonics is increased prior to the end of the fiscal year, these non-selected proposals may be funded.  

The typical proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of one or more related technical concepts or ideas.  Disjointed efforts should not be included into a single proposal.  
Proposers are notified that all proposals may be read, reviewed, evaluated and/or administratively handled by support contractors either to TRMC (i.e., IDA, MITRE and other non-federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) contractors) or to the executing agent.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in TRMC technical research in this program area and are individually bound by appropriate signed nondisclosure statements.  A proposer sending either an abstract or a full proposal acknowledges that this is acceptable to the proposer.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any sent by this method will be disregarded.  

Awards made under this solicitation are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any TRMC technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 2.101, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA/EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESSES 

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  TRMC's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.  

For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the two-volume document described in PROPOSAL FORMAT (see below).  Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered part of the proposal.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  

(l) overall scientific and technical merit in advancing test and evaluation of hypersonic systems, (2) relevance to T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort, and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.
As each proposal evaluation is completed, the proposer will be notified of selectability or non-selectability.  Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be kept on file until 30 September 2007.  These proposals will be considered for FY07 funding in the event additional funds are made available to support the hypersonics T&E/S&T focus area.  After 30 September 2007, all unfunded proposals will be destroyed.  (One copy of non-selectable proposals may be retained for file purposes.) 

While the TRMC T&E/S&T program is expected to be on-going, prospective offerors are notified that this program is currently not formally funded in FY 2007, and there is no certainty that these funds will be made available for this purpose.  Even when funding is received, not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds available, potential contribution and relevance to T&E mission, and scientific and technical merit.  Proposals may be considered for funding for a period of up to one year.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by TRMC.   
Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options  

PROPOSAL ABSTRACT FORMAT 

Proposal abstracts are required in advance of full proposals in order to provide potential offerors with a rapid response and to minimize unnecessary effort.  Proposal abstracts should follow the same general format as described for Volume I under PROPOSAL FORMAT (see below), but include ONLY Sections I and II.  The cover sheet should be clearly marked PROPOSAL ABSTRACT, and the total length should not exceed 15 pages.  All pages should be formatted to 8-1/2- by 11-inch page size with type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitation for proposal abstracts includes all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.  The material itself is not “repairable” and it is not available as an overhauled certified item; therefore reconditioned or used material would be unacceptable.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.  Tracebility means that the awardee must be able to show a clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part, from the OEM to the final vendor.

<DESC>This amendment is to answer questions regarding the brand name justification. BEP is not accepting equal products for this requirement. The following memorandum describes the reasoning: 

The Chief Information Officer Directorate has made a determination to standardize on state-of-the-art, DELL servers throughout the Bureau, both in the Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX facilities. Standardized DELL network servers provide for standardized motherboards containing standardized drivers that facilitate network management both with regard to initial imaging as well as subsequent network administration/management via the Bureau's Microsoft System Management Server (SMS). The Bureau's previous policy to purchase multi-brand servers did not provide for standardized network management. Additionally, a number of these "low cost" servers did not facilitate provisions for additional memory. When they did, different motherboards were oftentimes required, as were different network cards. 

Standardization not only facilitiates network administration/management, but also provides for enhanced asset management across the enterprise. Dell servers, providing for standardized mother boards across multiple generations of PCs, best meets the Bureau's needs.

The closing date for receipt of proposals (response date) is revised to 4:00 PM EDT on Friday, July 28, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-6191-9502.  This requirement is set aside for small business; the associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement for a contractor to furnish and install an Audio/Visual Presentation System in the Command Control Center (CCC) Conference Room located in Building 81.  
Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the contract line items as follows: clin 0001, Equipment -- Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination, New Cumberland, PA); clin 0002, Installation of equipment; clin 0003, one year warranty and preventative maintenance; clin 0004 (optional), second year preventative maintenance.  Note: Desired schedule for delivery and installation is 3 weeks ARO; Required schedule for delivery and installation is 4 weeks ARO.

The Scope of Work for this requirement is as follows:
The CCC conference room is approximately 28-feet long by 20-feet wide and is a SECURE ROOM (controlled access).  A 4-foot X 10-foot conference table and 10 chairs are positioned in the center of the room.  Current equipment in the room includes a white board, with three separate sliding panels, comprising most of one wall; six computer desktop workstations located along two adjacent walls; a SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) communications (email) network system, linking the 6 computer workstations previously identified to their respective (SIPR/NIPR) Local Area Networks (LAN); a wall-mounted 19-inch television (which will need to be removed by the Contractor before installation of the new AV equipment) connected to a Cable TV network and a ceiling-mounted visual projector that faces a retractable projection screen along the same wall as the sliding dry-erase white boards noted above.  Ideally, amongst other functionality, the added audio/video display capability being requested in this SOW will supersede (replace) the need to utilize the current video projection and supporting retractable screen currently being employed in the CCC.  There are numerous power outlets throughout the space. The conference room has a standard 8-foot drop ceiling.  A schematic of the space is available from the Contract Specialist POC.
Government responsibilities:
1. Provide access to necessary areas to complete the project during normal business hours (0800 – 1700 M-F)
2. Provide a safe and clean environment for contractor employees and their subcontractors.
3. Provide computer network system, both SECURE and NON-SECURE, to have video display equipment interfaced to.
4. Provide cable TV network to have video display equipment interfaced to.
5. Provide 110V power supply for the following equipment being installed by the contractor

Contractor responsibilities:
The contractor shall provide the capability for the Command Control Center (CCC) to visually display on three separate contractor-provided and installed 60-inch (or larger) plasma monitors, information and or video from existing computer network systems, SECURE (SIPR) and NON-SECURE (NIPR) systems and from an existing cable TV network.  Capability to display this information by these three plasma monitors must also include the ability to display multiple-source data into one plasma monitor simultaneously (minimum of two and maximum of four (quad) displays per monitor) and the ability to switch sources feeding these the monitors instantaneously.  It is anticipated that two of these plasma monitors would be located along the wall where the current retractable projection screen is located and the third screen would be located along a different wall within the same space. Each monitor must also have audio capability (integrated or as a separate speaker system)
The contractor shall also provide the CCC capability to add up to six additional computer workstations at the CCC Conference table, by providing the necessary computer network (both NIPR and SIPR) interface connections, to allow for a “plug and play” type capability and for these added workstations to also be able to feed information and have it displayed to the three plasma monitors, with the same level of functionality as previously described for the already existing computer network workstations. The overarching concept is that a laptop could be placed onto the conference room table and quickly and easily be “plugged” into the existing LANs, and removed just as effortlessly.  
The contractor will provide two audio/visual control systems.  One will be a movable desktop control panel, with the intention of it being used at the conference table, when needed. The second control system will be integrated with a portable podium. The podium should be easily movable (wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration. Both systems should be capable of operating independently or in tandem (simultaneously).   
Specific audio/video equipment recommended to be provided and installed by the contractor to achieve the required added functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Three 60 inch plasma data display screens (or larger), with a minimum 1024x768 resolution, with depth dimension not to exceed 6 inches, capable of being wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted. Each monitor must also include audio output capability. 
2. Combination S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR/DVD player. Only special requirement for this equipment is that it can be stored properly in equipment rack also to be provided by the contractor.
3. Two portable video control panels.  One suitable for desktop mounting, the other to be part of a portable podium system. 
4. Portable podium with attached/installed video control panel.  Due to size of CCC Conference room, there is no need for a microphone with this podium.  The podium should be easily movable, either on wheels or extremely light weight and be of standard size and configuration 
5. Equipment rack (if required), to house VCR/DVD player, switcher, and any other associated equipment. 
6. Required interfaces, control system, remotes, power switches, switch boxes, cables, connectors and other mounting brackets to install all items identified above.
7. Required interfaces and hardware to support capability of integrating additional six computer workstations on the conference room table, when needed (plug and play) to the existing computer network (NIPR and SIPR).
