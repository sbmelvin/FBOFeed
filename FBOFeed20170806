<DESC>The Government intends to purchase additional pipetting systems for the CDC's Newborn Screening and Molecular Biology Branch (NSMBB). <br />The Newborn Screening Molecular Biology Branch (NSMBB) in the Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) has a requirement to purchase Integra pipetting systems to create dried blood spot quality assurance materials and needs additional equipment to ramp up production of material. No vendor other than Integra is known to sell a cost-effective solution that will work with existing CDC standard operating procedures.
<p>Integra Biosciences offers a low cost VIAFLOW unit. This instrument meets all the requirements listed above for our needs. It operates on a 96 channel pipetting head that can dispense liquid into, and aspirate liquid from PCR plates. It can also repeatedly dispense whole blood at precisely fixed volume onto filter paper cards to prepare dried blood spot. Pipetting heads can be changed easily for different volume ranges, increasing adaptability for different needs which include PCR plates and filter paper card. The instrument can be used with sterile filter tips available for regular Integra multichannel pipets, which can be purchased at very moderate cost and thus keeping the operating cost down. The instrument has a very small footprint of 12"Wx14"Lx16"H, which saves bench space. CDC believes Integra BioSciences, Corporation is the only source available that can provide the pipette systems for CDC Newborn Screening laboratories.</p>

<CONTACT>Kruse, Rebecca  L.
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), on behalf of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), has a requirement for ¿Electromagnetic Field Impacts on American Eel Movement and Migration from Direct Current Cables.¿  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  This is not a small business set-aside. The solicitation number is M17PS00057 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government anticipates awarding a time-and-materials (T&M) type contract as a result of this solicitation. The period of performance is 24 months from date of award.  The North American industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541712 Research and Development Physical, Engineering, Life Sciences, with small business size representation of 1,000 employees. All potential offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (www.sam.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.    

The effects of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) emitted from submarine cables on marine organisms are of high concern to commercial and recreational fishermen throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic. While there are some studies, particularly from Europe, that indicate buried alternating current (AC) cables have little to no detectible effects on marine species, there is still concern regarding effects to important U.S. commercial fishery species from transmission cables. In particular, there is limited information on the effects from high voltage direct current (HVDC) submarine cables based on statistically valid measurements of effects. This effort will focus on the effects on the American Eel (Anguilla rostrata) from exposure to the Cross Sound HVDC cable in Long Island Sound.


HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organization¿s name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, business size status under the NAICS code, and DUNS Number via email to Rebecca Kruse at Rebecca.Kruse@bsee.gov.  

Responses are due no later than 2:00 P.M. Eastern Time, 21 August 2017.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. M17PS00057 and ¿Electromagnetic Field Impacts on American Eel Movement and Migration from Direct Current Cables¿ in the subject of all correspondence.

kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil
<DESC>Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) is seeking interested contractors with significant F/A-18A-F and E/A-18G experience to provide scheduled and unscheduled MRO services in support of Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A-F and E/A-18G aircraft forward deployed to the Western Pacific region. The MRO line will be located in Government facilities at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

Contractor MRO support will include the following: 

1)  Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) work under the Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP)
IMP requirements provide for airframe, systems and component inspection (through visual and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods), defect correction, preventative maintenance, operational checkouts and Technical Directive compliance.
 The IMP requirements for aircraft subject to this process are the minimum requirements, formulated and established to the depth required to ensure the reliability, operational availability, safe operation and airworthiness of the aircraft at minimum cost for the duration of the established service period. The IMP Program will provide depot support throughout the total service life of the aircraft.
a.  PMI-1 / PMI-2 events for F/A-18A-D (Legacy) will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.
b.  PMI events for F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G (Super Hornet) will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.
c.  The estimated Aircraft throughput is 10 - 13 aircraft per year. 
i.  1-2 F/A-18A-D aircraft per year (without expected overlap) 
ii.
  9-11 F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft per year
d.  It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be capable of supporting a nominal workload of 4 aircraft in flow, with a surge capacity to 5 aircraft in flow, regardless of specific T/M/S.
e.  It is anticipated that aircraft inducted for PMI will be towed to the Contractor’s location at the Government-owned/Government-operated facility (i.e. tow-in versus a fly-in PMI events).

2)  In-Service Repairs (ISR)
Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those requirements (Identified as Depot Level Maintenance) which cannot be directly related to any scheduled requirement described herein and which are discovered as an incidental result of the following functions accomplished as a part of and during the scheduled inspection.
a.
  ISR repairs are expected to be completed either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.
b.  ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout Japan (as a minimum) without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).

3)  Aircraft Modifications
a.  Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.
b.  The Government will provide the technical data required for completing modifications.

4)  Customer Service
a.  Customer Service requirements include Squadron Operational Level maintenance tasks performed concurrent with PMI activities when approved by the Government.

5)  Engineering Support
a.
  The Contractor shall provide engineering services, including submittal of repair procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Government.

6)  Logistics Support
a.  The Contractor shall provide the Government with timely supply data and material requisition requests necessary for completing aircraft maintenance requirements within the established TAT.

7)  Program Management Support
a.  The Contractor shall assign an on-site Program Manager under this contract. 
b.  The Contractor shall conduct annual Program Management Reviews (PMR).
c.  The Contractor shall attend weekly production meetings.
d.  The Contractor shall provide Production Plans that identify the “critical path” to PMI completion within the established TAT.

8)  Depot Level Maintenance

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />47.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />47.

The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014). 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose Quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate Quotes based on (LPTA) Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable.

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  

The Quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Award will be made to Quoter whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable. 

Quoters who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.

Quotes will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:

TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical specifications or features involved in meeting the requirements and whether the Quoter s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements.

Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical Quotes, if deemed necessary by Quoter to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the technical requirements (described above) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the salient characteristics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   

PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis. The Government will evaluate Quotes by adding the total of all line item prices.  

Evaluation Process:  A Responsibility Determination will also be made in accordance with FAR 9.1 Responsible Prospective Contractors. 

The Government will make use of several data bases to aid in establishing a more complete picture of financial risk, responsibility and ability the databases include, but are not limited to:  Experian, PPIRS, EPLS, CPARs, VetBiz (VIP) and the Small Business Administration (SBA).   

ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE DIRECTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER ONLY!   Please do not contact the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery regarding this solicitation.

The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014). 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose Quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate Quotes based on (LPTA) Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable.

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  

The Quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Award will be made to Quoter whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable. 

Quoters who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.

Quotes will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:

TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical specifications or features involved in meeting the requirements and whether the Quoter s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements.

Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical Quotes, if deemed necessary by Quoter to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the technical requirements (described above) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the salient characteristics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   

PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis. The Government will evaluate Quotes by adding the total of all line item prices.  

Evaluation Process:  A Responsibility Determination will also be made in accordance with FAR 9.1 Responsible Prospective Contractors. 

The Government will make use of several data bases to aid in establishing a more complete picture of financial risk, responsibility and ability the databases include, but are not limited to:  Experian, PPIRS, EPLS, CPARs, VetBiz (VIP) and the Small Business Administration (SBA).   

ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE DIRECTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER ONLY!   Please do not contact the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery regarding this solicitation.

EVALUATION</span></strong> <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer confirming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process: <br /><br />1. Price <br /><br />2. Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when either the offeror provides the exact or equal items with a proof that the products meet the item description stated on the APPENDIX A "Salient Characteristics of the Office Furniture" when submitting an equal item. <br /><br />(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration. <br />(ii) Next, the Government will evaluate the lowest offerors technical information as referenced in paragraph 2 above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable by the government. <br />(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical acceptability as defined in above paragraph 2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then evaluate the next low offeror in the same manner to determine if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</span></p>

<DESC>11 January 2017:&nbsp; This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for Aviation Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in support of United States Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A-F and EA-18G aircraft. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for F/A-18A-F and EA-18G MRO services and for determining industry's interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services. The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industry's capabilities for supporting the F/A-18A-F and EA-18G. <strong>FRCWP will host the Industry Day on 8-9 March 2017 at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM each day</strong>.
<p>FRCWP uses USG contracts with MRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance. In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) support. FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming F/A-18A-F and EA-18G IMP and ISR support requirement. Aviation MRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWP's mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to tour the relevant facilities on Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni, Japan. There will be limited availability for one-on-one sessions on 9 March for interested service providers. Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 45-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only. If questions arise during the one-on-one sessions that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on FEDBIZOPPS after the event.</p>
<p><strong>Advance registration for this event is required</strong>. Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit a reservation request via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil and to Mr. Seiji Yoshino at seiji.yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil. Requests shall include the company's name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses. Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and NAICS codes if available. No more than four participants per company may register. Registration submittals must include MCAS Iwakuni Base Access requests per the attached four (4) files. Participants wishing to attend the conference who do not possess the proper documents for access to MCAS Iwakuni must advise the USG during the reservation process. Additional instructions for accessing the industry day location will be provided at the time reservations are received.</p>
<p><strong>All registrations must be received no later than 12:00 PM Tokyo time on 10 February 2017</strong>. Vendors are responsible for securing their own lodging and food during this event. Industry participation is voluntary and the USG will not reimburse respondents or attendees for efforts expended as a result of this notice.</p>
