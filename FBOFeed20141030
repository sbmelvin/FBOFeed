<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis without providing for full and open competition to RuRo Inc. 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure the following, (Brand Name: RuRo Inc.):</p>
<p>Procurement:</p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch (CSGB) research focuses on the development and application of computationally intensive approaches to analyze large-scale genetic and genomic data, with a particular focus on identifying genetic contributions to human disease. CSGB investigators specialize in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology. These disciplines combine statistics, epidemiology, mathematics, molecular genetics and computer science to identify genetic variants responsible for increased susceptibility to disease and variation of phenotypic traits. <br /><br />CSGB scientists conduct studies aimed at understanding complex genetic diseases and developing new statistical methods and software to analyze data sets emanating from large-scale genetic association and linkage studies. They also use innovative approaches to distinguish genuine genetic influences from random background noise. As computational biologists, they employ comparative genomic approaches to understand the evolution and function of protein families and their ultimate role in human disease.<br /><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The renewal of the Labmatrix license software proprietary to Biofortis Inc. is critical to assuring the continued success of the NHGRI clinical research program. In addition, funding of custom development and other database services performed by BioFortis Inc. is essential to providing the specialized data management needs of NHGRI clinical research investigations. The Labmatrix software that was designed by Biofortis, Inc. has been customized specifically for NHGRI to meet and support specifications to specific research projects being conducted by NHGRI investigators.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Labmatrix is used to manage clinical research protocols and store many types of clinical data, including patient data imported from the NIH CRIS data warehouse. The renewal of the Labmatrix license is critical to assuring the continued success of the NHGRI clinical research program. In addition, funding of Custom development and other database services performed by BioFortis is essential to providing for the specialized data management needs of NHGRI clinical research investigators. Nearly one hundred NHGRI users, Labmatrix is currently being utilized in conjunction with 30 active IRB-approved clinical protocols and supports large-scale clinical research projects such as the ClinSeq Project and the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. The Labmatrix software provides functions not currently available in other clinical database packages. Moreover, the software has been customized to meet NHGRI specifications to support specific research projects being conducted by NHGRI investigators.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the procurement of historical calibration data of the Portable Oil Diagnostics System (PODS) to be utilized by the Navy Oil Analysis Program (NOAP) for analysis of the calibration interval, which is necessary to determine if the calibration interval can be extended beyond the current one year cycle, as well as the manufacture and installation of new identification (ID) plates to re-identify the PODS units in order to improve inventory management of the PODS on a sole source basis with HACH UltraAnalytics of Loveland, CO. HACH is currently under contract with NAVSUP-WSS, N00383-11-D-001P, to perform yearly calibration/maintenance of the PODS. This procurement will be to obtain the calibration data which was accumulated during the NAVSUP-WSS contract and to revise the identification plates on each of the PODS units as they are returned for the yearly calibration /maintenance. The installation process of the identification plates voids the calibration, which is why the new ID plates must be attached by HACH as the units are returned for calibration. The data being collected for the historical calibration records is only available through HACH as they are the owners of the data for the calibration efforts completed under the current NAVSUP-WSS contract. The Government does not possess the required calibration data/records, and HACH UltraAnalytics is the only firm that can complete the effort in the necessary timeframe, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the program's requirements. NAWCADLKE intends to award this contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons<br />Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA<br />intends to award a firm fixed price (FFP) contract to procure 35 Flight Termination Safe and Arms (FTSA) to L-3 Fuzing and Ordnance Systems, 3975 McMann Road, Cincinnati, OH 45245, manufacturer part number 22150538-07. The delivery schedule is 12 months after receipt of order. The FTSA is a critical subcomponent of a Flight Termination System (FTS). The FTS used by Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) freeflight testing activities has been certified for use in accordance with Range Commander Council (RCC)-319, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard. As the use of RCC member range(s) is necessary for the execution of required JSOW flight test(s), the JSOW FTS must meet RCC-319. Due to the strict safety requirements of RCC-319, only the above mentioned part meets agency needs. The FTS subcomponents are unique to the manufacturer and were specifically designed for the JSOW Program's FTS, thus no drop-in-replacement second source exists. Any substitution of a new subcomponent automatically invalidates the Safety certification for both the replaced subcomponent and the FTS. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses and questions may be submitted to NAWCWD Contract Specialist Christen Gonzales by email (preferred): christen.gonzales@navy.mil, fax to (760) 939-3095, or mail to Commander Code 220000D, NAWCWD, 429 E.

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.
 Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

<DESC>The NAVSUP FLCN Contracting Department Philadelphia Office has a requirement, in support of the US Naval Academy (USNA) Chemistry Department at 234 Halligan Rd, Annapolis, MD, 21402 for the procurement of one JEOL ECX-400 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, available from JEOL, USA, Inc., to include delivery and installation, and the removal of the existing NMR spectrometer. 
The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996  a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).
  NAVSUP FLCN intends to purchase the supplies on a sole source basis from JEOL, USA, Inc.  The acquisition will be solicited using FAR part 12 and test program for certain commercial items in subpart 13.5, anticipating award of a firm, fixed priced, supplies type contract.  
The USNA team has determined that the JEOL Delta proprietary software is the only software capable of analyzing and manipulating existing research data that has been gathered by the existing JEOL NMR spectrometer. Switching to a different manufacturer would require the recollection of data which would delay research publications by months or years until the hundreds of hours of spectra could be re-run through a new spectrometer.
  This would represent an unacceptable delay that would endanger the USNA mission. 
Those firms believing that they have a product capable of satisfying this requirement may submit a capability statement to the Government within 5 days of the date of when this synopsis is posted. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses shall be emailed to sonny.goda@navy.mil (PH: 215-697-9699). The Government will not pay for information received.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Water Supply and Water Resources Division (WSWRD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Micropyretics Heaters International, Inc. to purchase a Cascade e-Ion Plasma unit.
The  nature  of  the  acquisition  requires  high  flexibility  and  capability  of  equipments particular  to  EPA  research for  environmental  applications  such  as  water  treatment, disinfection,  and  air  purification,  it is imperative  to  produce  mechanically  stable  and uniform surface coatings on different materials and substrates with a variety of geometric and structural properties. These capabilities allow us to design reliable highly effective treatment processes with low energy consumption due to the flexibility of the equipment. Theunit needs to meet the following performance specifications: 1) ability to produce stable plasma in normal lab conditions instead of high vacuum conditions; 2) flexibility of the equipment to produce appropriate surface coatings on any substrates with different geometric and structural properties; 3) capability of developing appropriate surface coatings using any powders, which are commercially available or newly lab-developed  materials and 4) ability to reduce processing time to save energy consumption. 
Micropyretics Heaters International Inc. is the only known manufacturer that produces instrumentation capable of stable plasma production at normal lab conditions, the flexibility for geometric and structural properties of substrates to produce surface coatings, and the capability for the development of appropriate surface coatings using various precursors. The MHI Cascade e- Ion Plasma is the only known source that produces a plume containing ions, electrons, radiation and hot gas. The Cascade e-Ion Plasma produces a Clean Electric Flame ?plume that contains ions, electrons, radiation and hot gas, revolutionizing traditional processes for many applications such as brazing, hardfacing, sintering, general heating, 4DSintering? and surface cleaning. It is a versatile tool with many possible applications, especially in implementations requiring minimization of the heat affected zone. Its rapid heat-up time also  makes  e-Ion  Plasma  powered  devices  ideal  for  general  heat   treating, RTP replacements, photonic applications and dozens of other highly specialized applications. e- Ion Plasma is necessary to chemicals for mitigating dross in an aluminum melting process. Therefore, based on these requirements and concerns, the MHI Cascade e-Ion Plasma is uniquely suited for EPA research.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><b> <u>COGNIZANT OFFICE: </u> NASA/Armstrong Flight Research Center, Flight Opportunities Program, MS 2701, PO Box 273, Edwards, CA 93523 </b> <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is continually looking for ways to help advance the development of commercial space products and services. With the recent influx of U.S. private-sector companies interested in development of capabilities for reusable suborbital launch systems for access to space environments and/or small spacecraft orbital launch systems, NASA is seeking to better understand U.S. industrys interests in the private development of these systems. To that end, NASAs Flight Opportunities Program and Small Spacecraft Technology Program (The Programs) in the Space Technology Mission Directorate are seeking input through this Request for Information (RFI) that focuses on industry-developed suborbital reusable launch systems, and/or orbital launch systems for small spacecraft, that can serve as platforms for the purpose of supporting commercial (as well as potentially future NASA) missions. The Programs are also interested in the development of other closely related subsystems including ground support systems and test ranges to assist in launch vehicle development. <p> <b> <u>An industry-NASA partnership would: </b> </u> <p> Transfer and capitalize on a long history of NASA investments, knowledge, and expertise relevant to launch system technologies <p> Support a growing commercial interest to provide more frequent, reliable, and cost-effective sub-orbital and orbital access to space for small payloads than is currently available <p> NASA has recently awarded indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, five-year contracts to four entities to provide suborbital reusable launch and payload integration services for access to space for small technology payloads. The IDIQ contract was restricted to vendors with commercial operational readiness. Because NASA recognizes the need for developing additional vendor capabilities in this rapidly expanding sector, the IDIQ contract has provisions for ramping on of new vendors on at least an annual basis, and also has the provision for expanding the required technology to include other types of flight profiles, including the insertion of small payloads into orbit. NASA anticipates that vendors who participate in this partnership and successfully develop a commercial operational capability will seek to be included in the IDIQ commercial contract at some point in the future. <p> NASA seeks to better understand U.S. industry's plans for suborbital launch system capabilities that, in addition to serving commercial customers, could also enable space technology development and other missions. Potential areas of interest to NASA include (but are not limited to) providing access to relevant space-like environments for testing space hardware, evaluating various remote earth sensing and atmospheric sensing instruments, qualifying systems in the environment of space, testing systems in a microgravity environment, evaluating concepts for atmospheric entry, descent and landing for planetary landers. These capabilities typically are applicable for launching small payloads, which range in mass from 1 to 25 kg, under various flight conditions and to various altitudes up to and exceeding 100km above ground level. <p> NASA also seeks to better understand U.S. industry's plans for systems that could serve both commercial and government customers for launching small spacecraft into Earth orbit and beyond. In the case of the development of orbital capabilities, our interest is not limited exclusively to reusable systems  affordable expendable systems are also of interest. Typical small spacecraft payloads of interest range in mass from approximately 5 to 100 kilograms. Such launch systems would be of interest to NASA for the delivery of small spacecraft to Earth orbit for technology demonstrations and missions for science, exploration and space operations. <p> <b> <u>Potential NASA contributions to a partnership with U.S. industry include: </b> </u> <p> <u>Technical Expertise: </u> NASA envisions that an integrated team comprised of NASA civil servants and industry partner personnel could work together to design, develop, and test suborbital reusable launch systems or small orbital launch systems. <p> <u>Test Facilities: </u> NASA can provide industry partners, at no cost, access to testing facilities such as calibrated ranges, tracking and data acquisition systems, test stands, wind tunnels, thermal vacuum chambers and other environmental test facilities, clean rooms, etc., as available. <p> <u>Hardware and Software: </u> NASA may be able to contribute specific hardware and software elements for the development and testing of the suborbital reusable launch systems or orbital launch systems. <p> The type of agreement to be employed for this NASA-industry partnership is to be determined, but options include Non-Reimbursable Space Act Agreements, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or other (ref. NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 1050.1l, 15 USC 3710a(d)(1)). The key perspective is that NASA would provide personnel, goods, services and facilities, but not direct funding. Private partners would retain all intellectual property with NASA retaining non-exclusive limited rights. <p> <b> <u>Responses to this RFI should include the following information: </b> </u> <p> <u>Company information: </u> Company name and address, point-of-contact name, e-mail address, phone number. <p> <u>Type of launch system or  subsystem: </u> Reusable Suborbital or Small Orbital (if addressing both types of launch systems, please submit separate responses for each). Specify which or both launch systems are applicable to your proposed system; describe the current technology readiness level, why your proposed system is relevant to the Flight Opportunities mission, and how you plan to move the technology forward to flight. Feasibility of a partnership: Is NASA-industry cooperation feasible? What type of arrangement and agreement with NASA are desired by your company and why? Are Non-Reimbursable Space Act Agreements or CRADAs a viable approach? Identify any particular considerations, circumstances, or issues that would need to be addressed in an agreement. For example, what are your expectations regarding the allocation of intellectual property rights? <p> <u>Potential industry contributions: </u> List potential industry contributions that would complement the possible NASA contributions outlined above. <p> <u>Potential NASA contributions: </u> What expertise and support does your company need or desire from NASA? <p> <u>Services concept: </u> What commercial capabilities do you plan to develop if the partnership is successful? Describe the proposed suborbital reusable launch system or orbital launch system, payload accommodations (e.g. mass, volume, power, communications, ability for the payload to vent to the atmosphere, ability to eject a payload under controlled conditions, ability for the payload to control the launch vehicle, etc.), in the case of small orbital launch, the projected insertion conditions, mission concept, and operational readiness timeframe. For subsystems and launch support, describe how this development meshes with a specific commercial capability for suborbital and orbital launch systems. <p> <u>Business model: </u> What is your intended business strategy for offering commercial services? How many suborbital reusable launch system or small spacecraft missions of interest to the commercial sector have you identified? Have you identified other potential customers for a commercial payload delivery capability in addition to NASA, and how firm is the demand? What revenue model and pricing strategy have you established? How stable is your anticipated income stream? <p> Responders are also invited to comment on the selected NAICS and classification codes. <p> Responses are limited to no more than 15 pages, and should be submitted via email to the Point of Contact (POC) listed below. The subject line of the submission should be "Suborbital Reusable and Small Orbital Launch Systems RFI" and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. Files should not be greater than 8MB in size.

<a href="mailto:HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mail.nasa.gov">Sam  Ortega</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>1. SUMMARY The Centennial Challenges Program is NASAs flagship program for technology prize competitions (www.nasa.gov/challenges).  The program is an integral part of NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, which is innovating, developing, testing, and flying hardware for use in NASA's future missions.  The Centennial Challenges Program directly engages the public, academia, and industry in open prize competitions to stimulate innovation in technologies that have benefit to NASA and the nation.  For more information about NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, visit: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech">http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech </A>	  .  The Centennial Challenges program is seeking input on a stratospheric airship challenge proposed to start in 2015.  The challenge focuses on building and launching a lighter-than-air, powered, maneuverable airship operating in the stratosphere, while carrying a nominal payload for a pre-defined time period.  <P> This RFI seeks: (1) to gather feedback on the competition being considered, the prize amounts and distribution structure; (2) to determine the interest level in potentially competing in this challenge; (3) to gauge potential interest from the science community in using airships as a scientific platform; (4) to understand the applicability of the challenge capabilities for other non-government applications; and (5) to determine the interest level in administering the challenge (as an allied organization) or partnering on payload development. Specific information sought is detailed in Sections 5-9. Responses should be submitted in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format and are limited to five (5) pages in length.  Responses should include (as applicable):  name, address, email address, and phone number of the respondent, business, or organization, with point of contact for business or organization.   <P> This RFI seeks feedback from potential challengers (Section 5), from people interested in using airships as a scientific platform (Section 6), from people or organizations interested in using airships as a commercial/non-scientific platform (Section 7), from organizations interested in partnering with NASA to administer the challenge (Section 8), and from organizations (or educational institutes) interested in partnering with NASA to develop and build the challenge payload (Section 9). Comments must be submitted in electronic form no later than 5:00pm Eastern Time December 1, 2014 to Mr. Sam Ortega at e-mail address:  HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mail.nasa.gov.  Please use 202020 Challenge on the Subject line. <P> NASA welcomes all segments of industry, academia, and government, including associations, innovators, and enthusiasts to reply to this RFI.  This RFI is for informational/planning purposes only and the Government will not be responsible for any cost associated with preparing information in support of this RFI.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into any agreement or other obligation or to conduct a 20-20-20 Airship Challenge.  This notice is issued in accordance with the NASA Prize Authority, 51 U.S.C.  20144.  Responses may be made available for public review and should not include proprietary information.  Submitted information will be shared within NASA and with contractor personnel associated with the NASA Centennial Challenges Program. All responses are to be for general access by government reviewers. <P> For general information on the NASA Centennial Challenges Program see: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/challenges">http://www.nasa.gov/challenges </A>	 .  The point of contact is Mr. Sam Ortega, Program Manager, Centennial Challenges Program, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. <P> 2. BACKGROUND NASA is considering a stratospheric airship challenge to incentivize the demonstration of a long duration scientific platform for both Earth and space sciences. In 2013, a Keck Institute study (Airships: A New Horizon for Science) demonstrated significant interest in airships as a science platform from the academic community and possible industrial partners. The final study report can be found at <A HREF="http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf">http://kiss.caltech.edu/stu dy/airship/final-report.pdf </A> 	. There are few opportunities for space missions in astronomy and Earth science. Airships (powered, maneuverable, lighter-than-air vehicles that can navigate a designated course) could offer significant gains in observational persistence over local and regional areas, sky and ground coverage, data downlink capability, payload flexibility, and over existing suborbital options at competitive prices. We seek to spur a demonstration of the capability for sustained airship flights as astronomy and Earth Science platforms in a way that is complementary with broad industry interests. <P> 3. CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION This 20-20-20 Airship Challenge is currently contemplated as a two-tiered challenge that would provide opportunities to evaluate a wide range of innovative methods to launch an airship into the stratosphere, maintain altitude, and station-keep for a defined period of time.  This challenge would seek to engage the aerospace industry, educational institutions, and amateurs to provide solutions.  The Challenge would award prizes for successful demonstration of a stratospheric airship that would be required to accomplish the following tasks Reach a minimum altitude of 20 km. Maintain the altitude for 20 hours (200 hours for Tier 2 competition) Remain within a 5 km diameter station area (and navigate between two designated points for Tier 2) Successfully return the 20 kg payload (200 kg for Tier 2 competition) and payload data. Show Airship scalability for longer duration flights with larger payloads through a scalability review. <P> 4. DRAFT CHALLENGE RULES AND COMPETITION STRUCTURE Based upon responses to this RFI, NASA may develop detailed written challenge rules (Rules).  The Rules would include specific milestones, entrance, review and acceptance criteria, and prize award criteria.  The final Rules would be the official specification of the competition structure.  A requirement is being considered that competitors must independently gain FAA approval for their airships and provide a location for demonstration. <P> Milestones and Phases As currently envisioned, the challenge administrators would reserve 2o kg of payload space for judging instruments and would provide an Interface Control Document for the payload to airship interface and technical requirements and rules for the competition. The competitors would provide the remaining 180 kgs of payload mass a communication and airship cut down system and a scalability review package for their design Competitors would provide a scalability design review package 3-6 months after the challenge initiation. This review would determine if airship designs could be scaled to payloads of greater than 200 kg, durations of longer than 200 hrs, and an ability to navigate the airship along a defined course. The competitors would need to pass this review in order to be eligible to compete in the Tier 1 competition. Competitors who fail or do not submit to the initial design scalability review may still compete in the Tier 2 competition. However, a scalability review at the time of the Tier 2 demonstration would be required to win prize money. <P> Tier 1: Within a specified time window, competitors would have to integrate the provided 20 kg payload with their airship and launch, reaching >20 km for 20 hours with the 20 kg payload, staying within a 5 km diameter area. The payload would have to be recovered intact by the competitor, and the design of the airship would have to have passed a review defining scalability to larger payloads, longer durations, and the ability to course-follow within some margin, as specified by the technical Challenge document and judged by the review panel. Tier 2: Competitors would have to add 180 kg of payload to the provided 20 kg payload, with their added payload available for weight verification by the judges before the launch window specified. The airship would have to reach >20 km for 200 hours with the full 200 kg payload. During the flight the airship would be required to traverse a specified path within a defined margin, demonstrating a 5 km station at either end of the course. The payload would have to be recovered intact by the competitor, and the design of the airship would have to pass a review of scalability to larger payloads and longer durations, as specified by the technical Challenge document and judged by the review panel. The preferred competition model for a Centennial Challenge is head-to-head competition at a single location (annually) to excite public engagement, build competitive momentum, and focus timelines; however there have been exceptions to this when simultaneous, local launches have prohibitively complicated logistics. If a distributed competition model were considered, competitors would have to contact the challenge administrators at least one month prior to their desired demonstration date at their own location. We invite you to comment on the risks and benefits of a simultaneous competition, near-simultaneous competition, and/or distributed competition models across multiple locations and/or times for both envisioned Tiers of this Challenge (see Section 5). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 competitions would occur concurrently. <P> Awards NASA suggests offering the following prizes:  Seed Money: TBD $ ($200k to be shared between all successful teams with a maximum of $20k per team) could be awarded to teams passing the scalability design review. Tier 1 Award: TBD $ ($1M) could be split between teams successfully completing Tier 1 within 3 years of the challenge initiation. A possible scenario for splitting the Tier 1 prize money is 4 prizes of $500k, $250k, $125k, and $125k, starting from the first to demonstrate to the fourth. In the event of ties, a scoring rubric could be used based on desired characteristics of the vehicle, beyond what is required. Tier 2 Award: TBD $ ($1.5M) could be awarded to the first successful demonstration of Tier 2 within 3.5 years of challenge initiation. At the conclusion of the Tier 1 competition period, unclaimed Tier 1 prize money could be added to the Tier 2 award, with a scoring rubric breaking ties. <P> 5. INFORMATION SOUGHT from Competitors Interest Are you interested in participating in this competition?  Would the requirement that you must gain your own FAA approval for your airship impact you significantly? Are there other barriers that can be addressed in the timelines, requirements, and formulation of these challenges? Competition Milestones and Phases Is the requirement of traversing a specified path in Tier 2 sufficient to demonstrate the full extent of the airship capabilities? Please comment on the minimum time window needed for launch. Are there other concerns regarding technical requirements, or aspects of the challenge competition Milestones and Rules that should be added, modified, or deleted?  Please remark on the benefits/drawbacks of the preferred model of a simultaneous, head-to-head competition, at a centralized location versus allowing teams to compete at any time during the competition, with a 30 day notice of intent to launch, at self-selected locations? Are there metrics beyond the primary objectives of the Challenge that should be incentivized in the scoring rubric or with bonuses, such as stricter margins, sprint speed, additional flight duration, reusability of the airship, demonstration of additional payload capabilities e.g. pointing and measurement sensitivity, etc.? Competition Awards NASA is considering up to $2.7M in prizes. How could the award structure best incentivize participation and technical progress? Is the prize money sufficient to incentivize potential competitors? Please comment on the award scenario being considered. Are there other alternative scenarios that would provide greater incentives to compete? Competition Name Please suggest official names that best, succinctly, characterize this Centennial Challenge.  Please provide comments on how the naming could increase the public interest in the prize competition. What other actions should be taken to increase public interest? <P> 6. INFORMATION SOUGHT from Science Community Technology Development and Utilization Are you interested in using airships as a scientific platform? What scientific goals would you hope to achieve with an airship? What technological requirements should the airship have and/or demonstrate in order to meet your scientific goals (e.g., altitude, station keeping or event tracking, payload capacity, platform stability, etc.)? Are you interested in potentially including a science instrument as additional payload for the Tier 2 competition? <P> 7. INFORMATION SOUGHT from Commercial Community Technology Development and Utilization Are you interested in using airships as a commercial platform? What commercial goals would you hope to achieve with an airship? What technological requirements should the airship have in order to meet your commercial goals (e.g., altitude, station keeping or event tracking, payload capacity, platform environment/stability, etc.)? Are there specific emerging breakthrough technologies that are applicable to the competition? Are there specific commercial space and/or non-space related applications for this capability? Are there ways to adjust the competition metrics that would assist with the synergy with commercial space and/or non-space applicability? <P> 8. INFORMATION SOUGHT from Allied Organizations Interest Are you interested in partnering with NASA to plan and execute the airships challenge as an Allied Organization? Competition Name Please suggest official names that best, succinctly, characterize this Centennial Challenge.  Please provide comments on how the naming could increase the public interest in the prize competition. What other actions could be taken to increase public interest? <P> 9. INFORMATION SOUGHT from Partners for Payload development Interest Are you interested in partnering with NASA to develop and build the 20kg payload?

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.
<p>Background. <br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seek to launch a research initiative to address the rising use of antipsychotic medications by youth who do not suffer from a psychotic disorder. Most of the antipsychotic use in communities is for the management of non-psychotic conditions. Antipsychotic use increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and consequently, higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Additionally, the long-term implications of antipsychotic use in youth are unknown. For these reasons, efforts should be made to develop successful alternative treatment approaches that allow a more targeted and appropriate use of antipsychotics with the goal to minimize their usage by youths who do not suffer from a psychotic disorder.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives.<br />NIMH is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing potential contract services for a project entitled: "A Targeted Approach to a Safer Use of Antipsychotics in Youth".</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to successfully identify alternative treatments to the use of antipsychotics in youth (ages 5-17) that are not psychotic, which can manage the emotional and behavior disturbances of these children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Project requirements.<br />Interested small businesses must have the requisite capabilities and experience to successfully conduct this three-phase project, over an estimated 5-year period, which requires: 1) the development and preparation of the treatment algorithm (Phase 1); 2) the feasibility testing including a 12-month pilot study utilizing approximately 40 youth subjects (Phase 2); and 3) the implementation of the effectiveness testing through a clinical study of several hundred youth (Phase 3). Phases 2 and 3 must be conducted in at least 2 non-academic practice settings.</p>
<p>To successfully conduct this Project, capable small businesses should demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>1. Experience in managing and conducting comparable multi-site clinical trials (provide details)<br /><br />2. Access to an appropriate study population of youth and adolescents, through mental health service provider(s) in non-academic settings, who are willing to collaborate in this particular study (i.e., service delivery system partner(s) where the feasibility study and the practical trail can be conducted). Capability statements should provide names of potential partners and relationship if possible.</p>
<p>To adequately demonstrate the capability to perform this study the NIMH believes that it is necessary to have a current or recent working relationship with mental health service provider(s) in non-academic settings, involved in the treatment of children and adolescents with mood and behavioral disturbances, who can provide clinical resources and partner/collaborate in performing the study. Capability statements must reasonably demonstrate the ability to enlist these partners to conduct Phases 2 and 3 of this study.</p>
<p>3. Access to local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)</p>
<p>4. Available personnel and a research team with the appropriate education and experience in the following:</p>
<p>a. The treatment of children and adolescents with mood and behavioral disturbances and in the conduct of clinical trials in this patient population.</p>
<p>b. Clinical trial project management skills and experience</p>
<p>c. Knowledge of and ability to access existing publicly available data regarding treatment of child and adolescent mental disorders to be utilized in the development of a proposed treatment algorithm for the defined target population (ages 5-17)</p>
<p>d. Working knowledge of all regulatory requirements regarding research with human subjects</p>
<p>e. Information technology expertise in research database design and documentation; knowledge of computer software for statistical analysis addressing key aims of the study (e.g., acceptability, adherence, and reliability of assessment measures); data management capabilities in a multi-site setting; IT security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
<p>Other important considerations.<br />1. This requirement is based on a phased approach with unilateral Government options to proceed to each successive phase. Continuation and progression in the Project will depend on satisfactory completion of each phase (and submission of required deliverables), and feasibility to proceed into the next phase.</p>
<p>2. The Government estimates that Phase 1 will take approximately 6 months to complete; Phase 2 approximately 12 months to complete; and Phase 3 approximately 3.5 years to complete (total 5 years).</p>
<p>3. No Government property will be provided.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor will be responsible for compliance with Information Technology (IT) Security regulations (i.e., Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)) to ensure security of all data generated over the life of the contract</p>
<p>5. One (1) contract award is anticipated.</p>
<p>6. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>Regular technical progress reports will be required (depending upon the phase, these will be submitted monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually); and Final reports by each phase and for the entire contract will be required.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. August 2015 - September 2020 (including all options)</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought.<br />Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services described above under Project Requirements.</p>
<p>Also include the following: <br />1) Prior completed projects of similar nature (description, dollar amount, with period of performance)<br />2) Your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541720, 500 employees); and<br />3) Your management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #)</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes.<br />Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting, states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>

From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy. Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your companys business interests.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
General Radiopharmaceutical Contract

1.	The contractor shall provide radiopharmaceuticals products and delivery services and other products listed to supply the Nuclear Medicine Departments at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, North Florida/South Georgia VHS, Malcom Randall VA Medical Center, 1601 SW Archer Road Gainesville, Florida 32608, and the Lake City VA Medical Center, 619 S. Marion Ave. Lake City, Florida 32025. Radiopharmaceuticals delivered in unit doses in accordance with terms, conditions, pricing in contract and patient requirements. COR for this order is Tom Harrington. 
2.	Delivery:  The contractor shall deliver within two (2) hours or less from the time the order is received. The contractor shall label all supplies as to the amount of radiopharmaceutical, preparation time, expiration time, date and provide a bar code label to facilitate scanning data into a Nuclear Medicine information management system.

3.	All routine orders for Radiopharmaceutical doses will be placed to the contractor the day prior before the clinic close of business via phone. The order will include specified activities of doses and calibration times. The contractor will deliver the ordered Radiopharmaceutical doses to the Nuclear Medicine Departments in the two facilities.

5.	The contractor for the VA radiopharmaceuticals must be able to produce medical grade radioisotopes from preferentially procured non-Highly Enriched Uranium-235 (non-HEU) sources. A request has been made to VHA by the Interagency Policy Committee of the White House to preferentially procure Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), the primary radioisotope used in medical diagnosis, produced from non-HEU sources.  The reason for this request is that transportation and storage of HEU by radioisotope vendors may be a security and nuclear proliferation risk. Also, the enactment in January 2013 of the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011 supports creation of domestic production with the goal of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign sources of medical radioisotopes.

6.	The contractor will calibrate all Radiopharmaceutical doses to ensure proper activity ranges of +/- 10 percent of the specified ordered dose based on specific requirements provided by Nuclear Medicine Clinic based on guidelines outlined in 10 CFR Part 35.

7.	The contractor shall provide a daily invoice accompanying all Radiopharmaceutical shipments to the Nuclear Medicine Clinic for all orders placed.

8.	Contractor shall perform all quality control procedures as required by Federal and State regulatory agencies.
And will ensure that all Radiopharmaceutical doses provided are compounded and calibrated by or under the supervision of a certified Nuclear Medicine Pharmacist.

9.	The contractor shall provide courier service that is in accordance with Department of Transportation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other applicable regulating authorities enabling the delivery of all Radiopharmaceuticals. All packaging of radioactive materials shall be clearly labeled RADIOACTIVE on the outside of the shipping carton. The contractor shall be responsible for the removal of all used and unused radiopharmaceutical doses from the clinic within 72 hours of delivery. 

10.	The contractor shall notify the Nuclear Medicine Departments in the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center and the Lake City VA Medical Center immediately should the inability arise to provide Radiopharmaceutical doses.

11.	Technical Proposal Instructions: Offerors are required to provide sufficient technical documentation (including but not limited to: product literature, specifications) to allow for thorough evaluation of proposal. Additionally, the vendor shall fully explain their ability to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work.

12.	Ordering:  After award, the successful offeror will be furnished the name(s) of individuals authorized to purchase against this Contract.

<DESC>This is a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) W15QKN-14-R-0007 for the M205 Lightweight Tripod (hereafter referred to as M205 Tripod) (NSN: 1005-01-586-5702).  This announcement is issued for planning purposes only and constitutes a request for exchange of information pursuant to FAR 15.201.  This purpose of exchanging information is to both improve the understanding of Government requirements and knowledge of industry capabilities.  Offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW), intends to award Multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders. The contract(s) will include four (4) ordering periods to cover FY14 - FY17 Army and Department of Defense (DoD) M205 Tripod requirements.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small business. The anticipated contract minimum is $2.6Million.  The anticipated contract maximum is 44,388 M205 Tripods.  The minimum contract requirements will be met when the first delivery order is issued.  As future needs for the M205 Tripod are identified during the four (4) years of the contract(s), future FFP Delivery Orders will be awarded through Competitive Best-Value contracting methods among the Offerors who have been awarded an IDIQ base. <br>  <br> The M205 Tripod is used with the M2/M2A1 Heavy Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun and will be produced to a Government Technical Data Package (TDP).  The M205 Tripod is an improved ground mount which will replace the heavier and larger M3 Tripod for ground mounting the M2/M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine Gun and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG).  An integral Traverse and Elevation (T&E) Mechanism is included as part of the M205 Tripod and provides controlled manipulation in both T&E.  The M205 Tripod's primary mission is to provide a stable, easy-to-use, mounting platform for the M2/M2A1 and MK19 for delivering controlled, sustained, and accurate fire at extended ranges to support combat operations in offensive and defensive roles. <br>  <br> Any offeror(s) awarded a contract resulting from the formal solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT).  A crucial aspect of FAT is a Live Fire Test requirement to be performed by the successful offeror(s).  The Live Fire Test requirement(s) will be solely performed by the contractor.  Awardees will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished machineguns, ammunition, and equipment in order to be considered for award. <br>  <br> Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions and/or comments to this DRAFT RFP, prior to the release of a final solicitation.  Offerors shall submit questions electronically no later than November 27, 2013, to Matthew Davis at matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil and Gherin Fracasso at gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil.  It is anticipated that questions submitted will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) along with corresponding answers. <br>  <br> Note:  No information exchanged with industry will be considered in the evaluation process.  The Request for Proposal will be the only time that an Offeror's information is evaluated for award.  Offerors are directed not to submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M205 Tripod is categorized as Distribution B and is restricted. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level.  Pursuant to an existing Negotiated License Agreement, the manufacture of the M205 Tripod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories.  Only contractors who have a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and a U.S. Government Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), to be executed by an authorized representative of the respondent's firm, will be granted access to the technical data.  At the conclusion of the solicitation process, all respondents in receipt of data covered under the NDA will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the United States Government that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed. <br>  <br> This is a special notice only and is for planning purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A FINAL SOLICITATION. <br>  <br> The points of contact for this action are: <br>  <br> Gherin Fracasso, Contract Specialist, Email: gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil; and <br>  <br> Matthew Davis, Contract Specialist, Email: matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil. <br>  <br> NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED. <br>  <br> The Government will accept written questions by Email to gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil and matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br>  <br> ACC - New Jersey, Building 9 Phipps RD, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000

<p><br />Special Notice:</p>
<p><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), through its Specialized Munitions Division is the premier DoD facility for energetic material compatibility and storage studies involving heat flow calorimetry (HFC). Additionally, the Specialized Munitions Division collaborates with academia and industry on projects that create jointly beneficial partnerships. NSWC Crane is interested in joint research and development in the characterization and microcalorimetry analysis of Hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) based energetic materials. NSWC Crane seeks Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners that possess the expertise, capabilities, facilities, and experience in this area to explore R&amp;D opportunities with the Specialized Munitions Division. The specific areas to be explored are as follows:<br /><br /><br />1. Evaluation of metallic or nonmetallic specimens in contact with the energetic materials and effects on bulk properties of the energetic material, or effects on interactions with the coupons. Reported Methods, Instrumentation, and Procedure will be identified and/or modified for reliable prediction of safe storage and age-life assessment of HAN-based energetic formulations using calorimetric techniques.</p>
<p>2. Summarize recommended practices for analysis of coupons and HAN energetic compositions for their suitability and compatibility as tankage, components, or wetted parts in service for storage or use over time.<br /><br />3. Identify and perform initial testing of HFC methods suitable for safe storage of energetic compositions. Perform energetic composition compatibility assessments with metallic and nonmetallic coupons using the jointly developed methods and means.</p>
<p>This synopsis serves as a sources sought for CRADA participants and seeks information from companies capable of providing expertise, capabilities, facilities and experience in any of these fields and applications with respect to a CRADA effort. Any group that believes it has the ability to perform collaboration with NSWC Crane in these areas can identify its capabilities by submitting the information to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Science &amp; Technology Division (Code QXN), Attn: Mr. Darrell Hewins, Bldg 2044, 300 Hwy 361, Crane, IN 47522 or darrell.hewins@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Responses are requested by close of business November 14, 2014. After reviewing the responses, NSWC Crane may request a meeting or teleconference with responding parties to gain further insight into their capabilities. NSWC Crane is not obligated to hold these meetings with any or all respondents. If NSWC Crane decides to meet with a party, it will only meet with those that responded to this notice. NSWC Crane will not reimburse costs for participation in these meetings or teleconferences. NSWC Crane reserves the right to enter into CRADA agreements with no, any or all respondents based upon NSWC Crane's judgment of the potential success of collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>There may be a future acquisition directed to some or all of the capabilities which are the subject or focus of this research and development effort. Therefore NSWC Crane desires to avoid or mitigate unfair competitive advantages being conferred on any potential contractor or offeror as a result of CRADA efforts herein which actually or appear to compromise the integrity of the procurement process. In particular, NSWC Crane seeks to avoid or mitigate (1) -unequal access to information on Government needs and Warfighter evaluations of proprietary systems or improved versions resulting from this CRADA effort; (2) -impaired objectivity arising from CRADA partners' collaborative efforts with Government employees or Warfighters; and (3) -biased ground rules for a possible or potential future acquisition directed to a capability which may be a focus of this CRADA effort. This effort is expected to produce CRADA subject data deliverables which may be used to facilitate a possible follow-on acquisition using a Name Brand or Equal acquisition strategy, which is designed to ensure a fair competition while respecting the proprietary rights and previous investment of potential CRADA partners.</p>
<p>This is not a procurement, nor a notice for such a procurement, and at this time there is no plan or funding for a follow-on procurement. The legal authority for this cooperative research effort is the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified in Title 15 United States Code, Section 3710a, et seq. Under a CRADA, the partner contributes funds, equipment, or in-kind services to the joint research effort, leveraging their efforts with those of the federal agency for a mission-related objective. At Government discretion, subject data deliverables and inventions delivered under any CRADA agreement may be used in future competitive acquisitions.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the <br />local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates three WP-3 Lockheed Orion (WP-3) aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these WP-3 aircraft will be based out of the Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada area to be operated in support of critical winter storm/ocean wind related research. Due to winter weather conditions in the Halifax area, it is necessary that the WP-3 aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period on or about January 12, 2015 through on or about February 13, 2015. The hangar will protect the aircraft and it's instrumentation from the environment as well as protects the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities through the winter months.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />NOAA WP-3 aircraft will be operating out of Halifax, Canada in support of winter storms/ocean winds research. There will be several NOAA WP-3 mechanics in Halifax supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one WP-3 will be required in the hangar.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) WP-3 having a wing span of 100 feet, length 116 feet and 39 feet high at the tail. Note that the aircraft is equipped with a 105 inch (8.75 ft) air chemistry nose boom sensor that extends from the forward fuselage and must be taken into account for both hangar length and towing operations. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a <br />day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that <br />are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the <br />aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>Security Clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar rental price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) AC and DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and out of hangar.<br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, hi-speed internet access <br />(non-dial up with at least a 1 Mbps download/upload speed), heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>b) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from on or about January 12, 2015 through on or about February 13, 2015. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than February 13, 2015. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>c) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

4.	 All existing CAT 5 cabling will be removed from the renovated VBA space in this building from communications closets to existing work stations.  This cable will be properly disposed of by selected contractor. 

5.	This installation will be accomplished in two phases.  First, on or about November 17, 2014 demo of existing CAT 5 and initial pull of new CAT 6 will begin.  This will be in the same space and same time that the existing work stations are being removed.  Second, final installation, termination of each end, installation in telecom closets and new work stations, and final testing to begin on or about December 3, 2014 and conclude December 12, 2014. 

6.	An as built drawing of new cable runs will be required from the selected contractor.  
                                                                                                                

VI.	Description of Requirement

Cable Installation Requirements.
  
1.	Cable installation of up to 225 UTP plenum CAT 6 drops to 75 designated locations, including the following: install in specific VBA-approved race ways, where race ways are available; bundle and secure from the rack of origin; route and branch to the specified outlet termination location.  Cable termination of installed UTP plenum CAT 6 cable pairs at rack termination shelf and outlet location end, including certification and drop labeling at rack termination shelf and with an outlet location per designated naming convention.  The cable label naming convention in the closet is defined in section 4 of the VBA Regional Office Cabling Design Guideline. All changes shall be approved by the IRM Project POC.

Facility Requirements

1.	This cabling and cable infrastructure installation must be accomplished adhering to applicable national, state and local electrical codes and industry standards for the type of cabling used.

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

This is a Sources Sought Notice and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Any information provided to the Government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on an unrestricted basis. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only.
<p>The&nbsp;associated NAICS code 334111&nbsp;size standard is 1,000 employees. However the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name but which proposes to furnish an item which it does not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br /><br />The evaluation factors for contract award will be (i) PRICE, (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE, (iii) DELIVERY SCHEDULE, and (iv) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY (consisting of product performance characteristics, warranty, integration/installation capability, and technical support).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br /><br />The turn-key high performance computing assembly to be delivered and installed by the contract awardee is a complete computer cluster. The parts items and required performance characteristics detailed in Attachment 1 represent a technical solution that is known to fulfill the Government's requirement. Although the list of materials is based on Rittal and Hewlett-Packard products, offerors will be able to propose "brand name or equal" products (reference FAR 52.211-6). Proposals which include alternatives to the products identified in the description must be accompanied by technical documentation in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate compliance with the performance characteristics of this known solution.&nbsp; The required performance characteristics reflect the minimum salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that reflect the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs.</p>
<p>RESPONSE PROCEDURES <br /><br />Prime contractors who are 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, EDWOSB, SDVOSB, or SB concerns and who intend to submit a proposal for this notice MUST submit the following by 3:00 p.m. EST,&nbsp;4 November 2014:</p>

<p>(2) dated letter or certification from the appropriate competent jurisdiction that evidences 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or SDVOSB participation and/or certification such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov.);</p>
<p>(3) a technical package including the following:</p>
<p>i) a listing of equipment components with technical and performance specifications data in sufficient detail for the government to evaluate compliance with the performance characteristics of the known solution <br /><br />ii) a brief narrative on the integration/installation capabilities of your firm. <br /><br />(4) past performance information illustrating your firm's experience in work of similar type and scope identified above, to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with their current phone numbers</p>
<p>All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Small Business (SB) concerns. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered &lsquo;not interested' in this requirement.</p>

The majority of this funding will be awarded to aviation fuel saving efforts at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, such that the technology would be mature enough for consideration in future major acquisition strategies after successful demonstration. A portion of this funding may go to ground based advanced power and alternative energy efforts that are at a TRL 6 or higher to show military utility and promote the need to transition into the USAF's inventory of ground vehicles, aerospace ground support equipment, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources, and base infrastructure - with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.   <br>       <br>   The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.   <br>      <br>   The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.     <br>            <br>   This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.     <br>      <br>   If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.    <br>      <br>   The above discussed intent is subject to change.    <br>    <br>  ---Change 1---   <br>     <br>  The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.  The updates are included in the newly added Section 3 Proposed CPD Mission Weight Detail.  Submission instructions remain unchanged from the original announcement. <br>  <br>  ---Change 2---   <br>  <br> The purpose of this change is to extend the submission date and revise the submission instructions for responses to the proposed CPD requirements changes. <br>  <br> All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than November 7, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.  Questions/comments should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats.  E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size.

All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.   <br>      <br> All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 Incorporates attached Question and Answer Document posted 28 October 2014.  <br>  <br> Amendment 0002 incorporates attached Questions and Answers Document posted 30 October 2014.   <br>    <br>  Purpose:     <br>      <br>   The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation - Program Manager, Aviation Systems (PM AS) - Product Manager Aviation Ground Support Equipment (PM AGSE) is in the process of developing requirements for an Airmobile, (transportable by CH 47 helicopter), Expeditionary , (used in the recovery of downed aircraft), Aircraft Maintenance Crane. This Request for Information (RFI) is to address requirements and capabilities as outlined in the Capabilities section below.  Recognizing that manufacturers have been designing and producing a variety of maintenance cranes for years; the Army is issuing this RFI to gather information pertaining to your current business and engineering practices. If feasible, the Army may incorporate some of your information in the specifications for the Aviation Maintenance Crane.  Your input is valuable and very much appreciated.   <br>      <br>   Capabilities: SCAMP II; Type II   <br>      <br>   	Threshold (T) = minimum requirement; Objective (O) = desired requirement   <br>      <br>   1.	Reach, Lift and Positioning: The Type II crane will lift 3000 lbs. (T); 7,500 (O); and raise the top of the main rotor head with sling attached to a height of 14 ft. (T), 20 ft. (O); and safely position the load from its point of origin to its maintenance support fixture. (T = O)   <br>   2.	The Type II will be capable of reaching and maneuvering the CH 47 aft rotor blade (360 lbs.) at a height of 21 Ft. with blade sling attached. (T); 25 Ft (O); and then safely position the load from its point of origin to its maintenance support fixture.   <br>   3.	The Type II will include a capability for simultaneous boom and winch operation, and will include a positive fail safe feature which will prevent dropping of the load when raising and lowering the hook, extending, or elevating or slewing the boom.   <br>   4.	The Type II will have hydraulically, mechanically, or electrically leveling outriggers.   <br>   5.	The Type II will have tip-over protection to provide the operator with passive indication of impending system overturning moments. (T); automatically warn the operator of unsafe system moments, and automatically interrupt lift operations if the rated capacity limitation with respect to overturning moment. (O)   <br>   6.	The Type II will be transportable by all modes of military and commercial transportation including highway, rail, marine and air.  Type II must be airmobile by CH-47 helicopter.    <br>   7.	The Type II crane will be self-propelled, able to negotiate primary roads, secondary roads, and trails, i.e. over surfaces ranging from maintained and paved, to dry, unimproved, seldom maintained loose surface roads intended for low density traffic.     <br>   8.	The Type II will be able to autonomously operate cross-country, i.e. over terrain not subject to repeated traffic and where no man-made improvements exist. (T); Autonomously sustain speeds of at least 10 MPH. (O)   <br>   9.	The Type II crane shall be compatible with the Army standard fuel (JP-8) (and commercial equivalent specification Jet A F-24) and other military spec products for oil and lubricants. (T); The Type II will be compatible with multi-fuels e.g. JP8, diesel, or diesel alternatives without special maintenance procedures required to switch between fuel types. (O)   <br>   10.	The Type II crane will have sufficient fuel capacity to operate for a minimum of four hours before fuel is required.   <br>   11.	The Type II will be operable using an on-board diesel engine. The Type II will also be operable by plugging into commonly available AC electrical power. (T = O).   <br>   12.	The Type II crane will include a capability for precision-control. Precision-control allows very slow, constant, continuous, fixed rate of motion of the hoist, boom, and swing functions and should not exceed 5% to 10% of the normal speed. All controls will permit safe, precision control of the load. The Type II boom and hook functions will be controllable via controls located at the operators control station. (T); The Type II remote control system for all boom and hook operations, capable of being operated from the immediate vicinity of the crane hook.   <br>   13.	The Type II will have a device that automatically prevents the hook from being raised too close to the upper block, thus preventing contact between the hook and block.   <br>   14.	The Type II will include night driving lights only if able to sustain speeds  greater than 10 mph.   <br>   15.	The Type II will include work lights, on/off switchable. The work lights will be self-contained and adjustable, enabling safe lifting operations. (T); Type II work lights shall be switchable to Night Vision System (NVS) compatible lighting. (O).   <br>   16.	The Type II crane will have a keyless operation (electric start) ignition system.   <br>      <br>   Caution:   <br>      <br>   Responders to this RFI are placed on notice that participation in this survey is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.

<p>Date: October 20, 2014 <br />Amendment 001 October 23, 2014<br />Amendment 002 October 30, 2014</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement</p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement (SSSA). The SSSAs are issued to assist the Government in performing market research to determine industry interest and sourcing capabilities. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICIATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. This is not a guarantee of a future Request for Proposal (RFP) or an award. This document should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S Government. Any information provided to the Government in response to this document will become DTRA property and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associate with responding to this Sources Sought notice.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SSSA is to identify potential sources with the requisite experience and skill sets required to provide language services (consecutive and/or simultaneous interpreting) to support meetings, negotiations, technical demonstrations, conferences and other types of international interactions that will be held in the United States, its territories, and Foreign Countries. DTRA will require the translation of all manner of documents (written and electronic) and content of video and/or audio media (compact disc, .wav files, etc.). Source material documents will contain legal, business, contractual, medical, biological research and military terminology and concepts, including those dealing with arms control and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological). Given the complexity and technical nature of DTRA's programs, a high level of interpreting/translation expertise is important to ensure the provision of the most accurate and highest quality language support possible.</p>
<p>Potential sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, must demonstrate expertise and capability to perform worldwide in all physical and operational environments as detailed in the attached DRAFT Statement of Objective (SOO) and Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<p>-The companies' technical capabilities clearly indicting the ability to perform the tasks as delineated in the DRAFT SOO.</p>
<p>-Any small businesses that believe they can accomplish this entire requirement should indicate their small business status (see FAR Part 19) in their capability statement.</p>
<p>-The companies GSA Federal Supply Schedule if applicable.<br />-The companies experience in working with local subcontractors.</p>
<p>-The companies Duns and Cage codes.</p>
<p>Responses are not to exceed seven (07) pages in length.</p>
<p>No telephonic submissions will be honored. All capability statements shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government. Interested parties should send their product information electronically NO LATER THAN November 20, 2014 at 1PM EST to Regina Cronin, Contract Specialist, at LanguageServices@dtra.mil.</p>
<p>The estimated Contract Ceiling for the Language Support Services requirement will range between $35M-40M. The contract type is undetermined at this time however; the Government intends to issue a contract not to exceed 60 months in length inclusive of the base period and all option years.</p>
<p>Please note that this Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement is also being posted on GSA eBuy, Schedule 738II. Please see announcement # RFQ939349.</p>

<DESC>Please note that this notice does not constitute a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation, nor will the Government be liable for any costs associated with Industry Day.
<p>Release of an official solicitation is anticipated to occur in January 2015. Interested parties are encouraged to monitor FBO for the release of the solicitation. Point of contact for this action is Jason M King, Contracting Officer, jasonmking@fs.fed.us.</p>
<p>The United States Forest Service, Recreation One Stop (R1S) Program Management Office (PMO), and participating agencies will host a R1S Support Services Industry Day on November 13, 2014 at the American Mountaineering Center in Golden, Colorado. The Recreation One Stop acquisition process has and will remain completely transparent. Since 2011, we have continued to seek information from Industry and there have been five touch points with the public, including two Industry Day opportunities, market research and due diligence sessions and two public comment periods on a draft performance work statement and draft solicitation. When we posted our draft solicitation on October 8, we received different perspectives on our acquisition approach and the R1S PMO wants to provide an opportunity for additional discussion and understanding.</p>
<p>The location of the event is:</p>
<p>American Mountaineering Center<br />Foss Auditorium<br />710 10th Street <br />Golden, CO 80401</p>
<p>The November 13, 2014 Industry Day agenda is as follows:</p>
<p>8:30 Doors Open<br />10:00 Introduction/Administration <br />10:10 Welcome Remarks and Interacting in a Dynamic Environment<br />10:30 Recreation.gov: Who We Are and our Vision<br />10:45 Acquisition Overview <br />11:00 R1S Support Services - Key Imperatives<br />11:20 Recap and Afternoon Overview<br />11:30 Lunch Break<br />1:00 Public Comment Session<br />3:00 Break<br />3:15 Q&amp;A Panel <br />4:00 Closing Comments<br />4:00 Open Networking Forum <br />5:00 Doors Closed</p>
<p>The first part of Industry Day will be held from 10:00 to 11:30 a.m. (MST). The PMO will present an overview of the R1S Support Services procurement and highlight key initiatives.</p>
<p>The second part of Industry Day will be conducted from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. (MST) and will consist of a series of public comment sessions each followed by a question and answer period. Companies or personnel may request in advance, an opportunity to present their thoughts and ideas to the general forum. Speaking opportunities will be limited due to time constraints. Those who wish to speak to the general forum will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis. Industry Day attendees must notify the U.S. Forest Service at edwardjrinkavage@fs.fed.us of your request to present public comments. Each individual will be limited to five (5) minutes followed by five (5) minutes of questions and answers. Additional questions and answer time will be scheduled at the end of this session.</p>
<p>The final part of Industry Day will include a non-hosted networking session from 4:00 to 5:00 p.m.. The session is intended to promote teaming on the R1S Support Services procurement. Companies who intend to prime the R1S contract will have the opportunity to network with those individuals or companies who may be interested in a potential teaming arrangement.</p>
<p>Attendance is limited to 350 personnel due to facility size constraints. Therefore, companies or personnel who plan on attending the Industry Day must pre-register by e-mailing Ed Rinkavage at edwardjrinkavage@fs.fed.us and provide attendee names, company names, and e-mail addresses. Please limit attendees to five (5) personnel from each company. Pre-registration is required to be guaranteed admission. Individuals who do not pre-register may not be granted access due to the facility size constraints. This requirement also applies to all representatives from the government.</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FBO for information on the RIS Support Services procurement. Agendas, power point briefings, attendee list, etc., will not be available until after Industry Day and will be posted to FBO following the event. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading applicable documents.</p>

<DESC>30 October 2014 update: The Distribution Agreement (Attachment 12) has been revised and is hereby replaced.  All attachments can be accessed by clicking on the  quote mark Additional documentation quote mark  link below. <br>  <br> The intent of this announcement is to provide the Draft Request For Proposal (RFP) for the Advanced Range Tracking and Imaging System (ARTIS), Solicitation No. W900KK-15-R-0001. The Draft Solicitation includes: the Performance Specification, Statement of Work, Contract Deliverable Requirements Lists, and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, among other supporting documentation as listed in section J, and have been provided for your reference and review.  All documents may be subject to change.    <br>        <br>    In accordance with Section L of the Draft RFP, questions regarding this draft solicitation shall be submitted by e-mail to the above POCs with the solicitation number in the subject line.  The Government will answer questions through the issuance of the final solicitation provided those questions are received by 12:00 p.m. (1200 hours) EST, November 7, 2014.  Offerors shall use the Question/Comment Form included as Attachment 4 in Section J of this draft solicitation.  Questions received after the deadline may not be answered.  Questions shall not include proprietary data.      <br>        <br>    This is not a final RFP and no proposals are being requested at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received or costs incurred as a result of this announcement.  Any cost associated with a response is solely at the interested respondent's expense.     <br>        <br>    The PEO STRI Acquisition Center anticipates issuing the Final RFP electronically via the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) in December of 2014. This date is subject to change.    <br>        <br>    Additional Information:    <br>        <br>    The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators, Instrumentation Management Office (PM ITTS/IMO) intends to issue a final RFP for the ARTIS. The objective of the acquisition is to provide Department of Defense (DOD) Test Ranges with an optical tracking and imaging solution that consists of a remotely-operated capability, increased performance and a lower life cycle cost. The ARTIS system will provide the DOD Test Ranges the capability to track and obtain vital imagery data required for testing new and emerging weapons systems. ARTIS will enable the Test Ranges to capture Time-Space-Position Information and imagery in Visible, Mid-Wave IR, and SWIR bands. ARTIS will replace the aging fleet of legacy tracking systems, such as the Kineto Tracking Mounts.     <br>        <br>    The ARTIS solution will consist of two different optical tracking systems: a small, highly dynamic Close-In Optical Tracking System that will provide improved support capabilities for high slew-rate launch and impact requirements, as well as ground-based testing scenarios and a medium-sized Fly-Out Optical Tracking System that will support longer range imaging requirements, to include ballistic missile fly-outs, mid-course tracking, and high-altitude intercepts. Both systems will incorporate multi-waveband optics to allow simultaneous sensing in Visible and Infrared bands. Computer automation, remote operability, weatherization, and improved data fusion with other Test Range systems will provide the efficiency and robustness that is not available with the current architecture.     <br>        <br>    The ARTIS procurement will be conducted using full and open, competitive, Best Value-Tradeoff source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.    <br>
