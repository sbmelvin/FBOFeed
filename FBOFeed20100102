<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Bernadette Mattingly, located in Jeffersonville, Indiana, for the provision of services as a Decennial Census Coordinator for the upcoming 2010 Decennial Census. The proposed contractor has unique capabilities due to longtime specialized relevant experience that will produce an efficient review and consultation of procedures she has helped to establish, production of training materials, communicating with familiar managers, and trouble shooting of problems that may arise during the processing of the Decennial Census. The work will take place at the U.S. Census National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, with some possible work occurring at the U.S. Census headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. The initial agreement’s period of performance may be for up to eight months with possible one year options. Bernadette Mattingly is the only known source with the required specialized expertise to meet the requirements. The time and effort necessary to advertise and award a contract and train another individual to perform the needed services would be seriously detrimental to the mission. Estimated total cost for 2010 is less than $100,000. This is not a solicitation announcement or an invitation for bids. Information received regarding this announcement will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Otherwise, the Census Bureau believes it is in its best interest to award an order to Bernadette Mattingly for services as a Decennial Census Coordinator. Inquiries may be addressed to Clark Terrell, Contract Specialist, NPC Procurement.
