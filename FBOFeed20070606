1.	Completed signed offer, form SF-1449, bid schedule and provision 52.212-3
2.	Information that will assist with the evaluation of proposals in meeting selection criteria below

Firms will be evaluated and ranked using the following selection criteria: 

1. Past performance in developing CNMPs following procedures similar to California NRCS procedures and 2. History of providing timely and complete work products on previous NRCS contracts are equal in importance.  

3.Knowledge of local dairy manure management practices and experience providing manure-nutrient management services to producers 4. Experience in planning (considering all aspects of an operation; systematic process of inventorying resources, identifying problems, developing and evaluating alternatives and documenting a course of action), and 5. Capacity to provide dairy engineering and manure nutrient management services are equal in importance but less important than Items 1 and 2.

<DESC>Department of Energy to Compete Management & Operating Contract for its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Note: This is for informational purposes only and is not the formal RFP.  This site will be updated when the RFP is relesed.) WASHINGTON, DC â€“ The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced that it will compete the management and operating (M&O) contract for its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, the nationâ€™s primary laboratory for clean energy research.  The competition reflects DOEâ€™s commitment to regularly compete its M&O contracts for DOE national laboratories to ensure the greatest possible benefit to DOE, its mission and this Nation. The current contract, which expires on November 8, 2008, was last competed in 1998. â€œNRELâ€™s work, including research and development supporting President Bushâ€™s Advanced Energy Initiative, is vitally important to increasing our nationâ€™s energy security,â€ DOE Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Alexander A. Karsner said â€œHolding competitions for the management and operation of our world class national labs ensures that we have the best team managing the work and provides the best value for taxpayer dollars.â€ NREL conducts research, development, and deployment (RD&D) in alternative energy areas such as converting sunlight to electricity, generating electricity from wind, producing fuels and high-value industrial products from biomass, and producing and storing hydrogen fuel generated from renewable feedstocks. In addition to its RD&D activities, NREL, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, provides DOE expert counsel on the scope and direction of DOEâ€™s alternative energy and energy efficiency programs.  Established in 1977 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, NREL was renamed in 1991 to reflect its expanded mission and importance.  NREL has a staff of more than 1,000 and an annual budget of approximately $220 million. NREL is currently managed by the Midwest Research Institute (MRI), a not-for-profit research institution headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. More information about this competition will be posted, when appropriate, on Federal Business Opportunities website and on the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System website.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Solicitation Number FA8601-07-R-0046:The scope consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, appliances, devices and  materials, and performing all operations necessary in connection with  Project 050011, Replace SCADA System Basewide. This project replaces the  remote monitoring and control system, Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA), for the primary electrical power distribution system  located at WPAFB. This system consists of power sensors, relays, remote  terminal units, and the interconnecting control conductors in 9  substations located throughout the base. It also consists of a front end  computer system located in one central facility along with other remote  monitoring sites. This project requires very specialized equipment and  computer programming to result in a fully functional SCADA system.  The  SCADA system monitors the entire primary electrical distribution system,  and allows for complete control of that system. The scope will also  include associated architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, plumbing,  electrical and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings and  described in the specifications. NAICS Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0  Million. The overall estimated price range is between $1M and $5M. Period  of Performance is 365 days.

Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998  must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, “Required Central  Contractor Registration.” SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS:The SCADA system  monitors and controls the primary electrical distribution system for all  of WPAFB. The contract requires the installation of highly specialized  hardware controlled by custom written computer code. It requires the  correct installation of thousands of control conductors, hundreds of  relays, and hundreds of sensors. Mistakes can cause unscheduled power  outages to multiple facilities throughout the base, and can be difficult  to trace to eliminate. Each unscheduled power outage has a large financial  impact to the base, and the primary electrical distribution system is the  most critical utility system of all. Notes: (1)The solicitation will be  available on the website on or about 09 July 2007, at  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) The specs and drawings will be posted  along with the synopsis.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICIATION BEING POSTED AS PRESOLICIATION IN ORDER TO UPLOAD ATTACHMENTS. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement to acquire the services of a service provider to facilitate FEMA in obtaining authenticated applicant identity verification services.  The service provider provides these services through an ISAAC/NEMIS interface across an Internet connection.  Call centers, provided by FEMA, at any disaster nationally, are the locations from which the information is generated for the service provider to create the digital queries.  FEMA is also interested in validating the identity, home ownership, and records pertaining to tangible property for validation of the residency, the associated recovery claims, and returning a victim the value of property that can be assessed and associated with the victim/applicant identification.  This contract will also include monitoring methods that are of the highest industry standard thereby allowing the Government reporting information that demonstrates the process in reducing the potential for fraud claims and is not creating unnecessary transactions for identity scoring.  A desired outcome is to increase the performance measurement standards for transactional accuracy in identification authentication at call centers and with on-line requests for services.  The anticipated contract will be a commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type. This requirement will be procured on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC for a project, ?Reliability and Validity of Telephone Cognitive Assessments?.   The contractor shall recruit participants and administer and score the defined measures of memory and other cognitive functions and supplemental tests to 100 participants distributed across 4 groups of 25 individuals per group.   The contractor shall obtain necessary Human Subjects approval, recruit participants, contact and schedule the selected participants, administer, score and enter data from the test battery and will forward the data electronically to the NIA Project Officer.  The Contractor will also provide consultation necessary for interpretation of data.  The general procedures will entail the following design: 1) a 2x2 factorial design: women shall be randomized to either telephone/telephone; telephone/face-to-face; face-to-face/ face-to-face/telephone; b) there shall be 25 women per cell; 3) there shall be a 6 month interval between first and second test administration; 4) these data shall allow analysis of comparison between methods (cross-sectionally); 5) these data shall allow analysis of the relative sensitivity of methods to change over time.  The Test Battery to be performed shall include the following measures: 1) telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS) without words list; 2) modified mini mental state exam (3MS); 3) California verbal learning test (CVLT) using the modified WHISCA administration; 4) Digit span subtest (digits forward and digits backward); 5) category fluency (animals); letter fluency (FAS); 6) Perceived memory ? 7 questions from the nurse?s health study; 7) quality of life ? MOS short form ? 12 items; and 8) depression ? Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form.
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 
253(c)(1), FAR 6-302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because the Wake Forest University is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Shumaker and her colleagues conduct the WHISCA and co-STAR studies and have extensive experience in performing and coordinating the neuropsychological test assessments according to the standards set by Lab of Personality and Cognition (LPC) investigators.  Compatibility with WHISCA, Co-STAR and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging studies is required to maximize the utility of the data acquired as part of this study.  The Wake Forest  University of School of Medicine?s experience with these test batteries and the LPC standards are necessary to assure that estimates of test-retest stability and validity of the telephone battery are accurate and applicable to LPC studies.  A survey of the literature in this field shows that there are no other sources for these services because Dr. Shumaker and her colleagues have the required staff, experience and facilities for administering, scoring and analyzing data according the LPC standards.   The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>NSN 0R-7021-015187226-BL, REF NR 233A915-210, QTY 38 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control     activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design    capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified     source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The       approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical     data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or      knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate      source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification  procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having        jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item         requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is      flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined      adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the          source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been          solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that  an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an   approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information    detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control      Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure           identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's       experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you  have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being          evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which   forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to        provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous   submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be      considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a    source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or   approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to    meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue      based on Fleet support needs.

<ARCHDATE>06052008
<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 3608547220     Sarah_Welch@nps.gov;
<DESC>BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION:  The current radio system at North Cascades NPS Complex consists of five repeater sites and various base stations located throughout the park. The system provides conventional wideband VHF communications for NPS operations. The entire system is scheduled for conversion to narrowband in 2008 which includes additional repeater sites and new narrowband (Project 25) radio equipment. Of the existing repeater sites, three sites (McGregor, Ruby, and Copper) have been in place for over 30 years and the facilities have become deteriorated and in danger of failing. In general, each of the sites consists of a 3'x 4'x 5' fiberglass shelter that is staked and/or guyed in place. Two sites (Ruby and McGregor) have separate 20' towers to support antennas, the third (Copper) has a 15' mast affixed to the shelter to support an antenna. Solar panels are mounted on the towers at McGregor & Ruby and on the shelter at Copper.  The work proposed in this contract consists of the rehabilitation of three of the mountaintop radio sites for the current system and includes the following: 1.	Remove three existing mountaintop radio repeater shelters, antennas, solar panels, batteries, controllers and ancillary radio equipment. 2.	Prepare and install foundations for new repeater shelters at three mountaintop sites. 3.	Install new, Government-furnished repeater shelters at each of the three mountaintop sites. 4.	Install new antennas, solar panels, batteries, controllers and ancillary radio equipment  5.	Remove all construction debris, old equipment, and to the extent possible repair and groom site to a natural appearance. The repeater sites are in wilderness areas and the contractor will be required to comply with restrictions that govern activities within designated wilderness. The actual radio repeaters at each site will be installed by NPS personnel. All other work will be done by the contractor and must meet the standards described in Motorola R-56 Manual, Standards and Guidelines for Communication Sites.  Maps and information about the park are available at www.nps.gov/noca CAUTION!  This rehabilitation project will require working on hazardous backcountry mountaintops. It is anticipated the work will require the use of helicopters to move materials and personnel to and from the work sites.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a high resolution 5-camera photogrammetric shape/motion analysis system.  The system includes “intelligent” cameras providing a unique expansion capability without the constraint of system bandwidth typical with most systems.  The system must be supported by a single desktop type computer/workstation and capable of providing data in “real time”.  The objectives of these measurements are to monitor the aerodynamics and structural dynamics of the model and to provide a database for the verification and validation of the mathematical/computer models developed to predict the performance of these concepts.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this supply from Vicon Motion Systems, Inc. who is the only known responsible source.  There is no other system currently available that is capable of providing detailed shape measurement data in real time to the required accuracy of 1:25000.  The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c) (1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the items in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 12, 2007.

<DESC>The USAID Sri Lanka conflict response program will utilize a variety of programmatic tools to respond to the escalating
conflict in the country. The statement of work requires the contractor to implement an integrated strategy, both within the
variety of elements of the SCRP program and in coordination with the USAID mission?s CORE program issued by its economic growth program ? Request for Proposal (RFP). Program coordination should not be viewed as a utopian goal, often discussed but rarely achieved. All relevant material for both solicitations may be found at http://www.usaid.gov/in/
under the ?Working with us? sublink.
The SCR program will support two areas identified by the United States Government?s (USG) Foreign Assistance Framework: (a) Peace and Security and (b) Governing Justly and Democratically. The program under the peace and security objective will address conflict mitigation and reconciliation elements and the Governing Justly and Democratically objective will address the following elements: Rule of Law and Human Rights, Local Government and
Decentralization, Civil Society and Media.
The statement of work has compartmentalized the Foreign Assistance Framework into four activity areas: human rights,
local governance, conflict mitigation and reconciliation and media. The four activity areas will engage with populations
that are most at risk, with a regional emphasis in the North Central and Eastern Provinces. However, many conflict
response strategies in the regions must be complemented with activities with a national focus.

<CONTACT>Marcus Johnson, Regional Contracting Officer, Phone 91-112-4198796, Fax 91-112-4198454, Email marcusjohnson@usaid.gov
<DESC>Building on earlier and ongoing Mission economic growth programs, the COnnecting Regional Economies (CORE) seeks to address the disparity in economic development between the North and East and the rest of Sri Lanka. This disparity is a major driver of Sri Lanka?s ongoing ethnic conflict. CORE can help establish
conditions conducive to a political solution to the conflict by fostering economic growth that addresses regional
and socio-cultural inequities.

CORE will provide technical assistance and training to accomplish the objectives of the program. In
addition, the CORE program will include a flexible small grants-under-contracts program of up to 10% of
the contract award to support small-scale infrastructure, business development services, support to
associations, chambers of commerce and others to promote peace-building economic growth activities.
Small grants will be limited to no more than the equivalent of US$100,000 per grant in order to ensure that a
significant number of grant activities are funded by a variety of groups working in the target conflictaffected
and ?strategic areas.
USAID will provide the contractor the equivalent of US$5 million in Sri Lankan Rupees from a PL 480
Title III Agreement local currency account held jointly with the Government of Sri Lanka to augment the
U.S. dollar obligated in the contract. These local currency funds are within the U.S. Government?s
maximum estimated budget stated in Section L. It is not additional to the stated budget amount (funding to
be made available). The local currency funds must be utilized by the contractor for small grants, microcredit,
local training and other closely related costs thereto. It will enhance the contractor?s ability to
improve food security and agricultural development, promote free and open markets, support microenterprise
development, and provide small grants for infrastructure activities in rural areas.
CORE will build upon the achievements of previous and ongoing USAID economic growth programs, while
bringing to the new program a strong emphasis on the more equitable distribution of benefits. The Mission
activities to date offer a number of examples of interventions with impacts that CORE may want to develop
further to the benefit of populations in conflict-affected and ?strategic areas.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Purchase of (2) Nuance Multispectral Cameras from Cambridge Research and         
            Instrumentation (CRI)

Purpose/Brief History:

One of the missions of the NCI, LP is to develop tissue based biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapy response.   In order to provide a high quality service and support ongoing clinical trials, there is a continuous need to be able to accurately quantify labeled targets on tissue sections.   Accurate quantification of immunohistochemistry is highly challenging because it requires resolution of labeling colors which often have overlapping absorbance spectra. In addition, quantification of multiple targets needs to be done under fluorescent or bright field imaging depending on the test being performed.  

The camera technology currently in use at the LP does not allow separation of colors based on individual spectra. Therefore the LP needs to upgrade to a multispectral camera. With this equipment the LP will be able to quantitate these colored stains accurately. The only multispectral camera available for both bright field and fluorescent imaging is the Nuance camera by CRI.
    
PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 
(2)  For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:

In order for the LP to further their mission they need to have the capabilities provided by the Cambridge Research and Instrumentation Nuance Multispectral Imaging System.  There is no other vendor capable of 	delivering an instrument with the needed capabilities of the Nuance Multispectral Imaging System.  This imaging system is capable of performing optical imaging from 420nm to 720nm wavelengths in discrete increments. The emission filter is based on a liquid crystal 	technology and is completely adjustable. The camera is compatible with multiple light sources including both fluorescent and bright field, as well as being compatible with multiple microscopes from different manufacturers. The unit comes with its own customized software capable of acquiring spectroscopic cubes and un-mixing the color components within a sample so that each component of a sample may be quantitated individually.  These features are patented and available only from Cambridge Research and Instrumentation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment 2 issued on June 6, 2007 to extend the locality requirement to a 200-mile radius of MMAC.  Submittals are due by 2:00 p.m. CST, June 21, 2007. Amendment 1 issued to add the following statement: Hand-carried proposals (or proposals sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Submittals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Qualified Vendors List 2007, Attn: Connie Houpt; due 2:00 p.m. CST, May 18, 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, is re-establishing its Qualified Vendors List (QVL) used for FAA procurements for the manufacture of modification kits.  These modification kits are used primarily in navigational aids, communications, radar, weather, and environmental areas in support of the National Airspace System (NAS) equipment to improve the safety and system/equipment reliability and supportability.  To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  Existing QVL vendors must respond to this announcement by providing all required information for evaluation. (A) The QVL is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  The FAA Acquisition Management System defines a small business as, "... a business, including it's affiliates, that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing the products or performing the services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the Federal Government's criteria and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards."  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 334511 (750 employees).  Vendors shall complete and submit the Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1) with required documentation. (B) Vendors must have a manufacturing facility located within a 200-mile radius of MMAC at time of this announcement.  The address of the manufacturing facility shall be provided at time of submission of documentation.  This requirement is for the purpose of providing technical guidance, monitoring manufacturing processes, witnessing factory tests, monitoring packaging procedures, and identifying potential problem areas in a timely manner. (C) Vendors shall submit a description of their capability to meet the following seven criteria:     1. Technical Documentation - supplier catalogs and/or Internet access for research and acquisition of supplies and materials;     2. Manufacturing Capabilities - fabrication and manufacturing capabilities;     3. Test Capabilities - equipment needed to provide power to circuit inputs and measure resultant outputs of fabricated mechanical, electrical, and electronic items;     4. Packaging and Labeling Capabilities - equipment and materials needed to meet FAA packaging and labeling requirements as found in ASTM-D-3951, ASTM-D-4169, and MIL-STD-129 (Attachment 2);     5. Quality Control - quality control system that complies with FAA-STD-013d, Quality Control Program Requirements (Attachment 3);     6. Logistics and Inventory - sufficient space for receiving, assembly, storage, and shipping of modification kit parts and supplies; and     7. Software and Firmware - capability in-house or have sources for software and firmware needs.   This documentation is limited to a maximum of ten pages for all seven criteria.  To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be provided, along with a name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the following address:  FAA/MMAC, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125, Attn: Connie Houpt, AMQ-210, with reference made to Qualified Vendors List 2007, by 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, June 21, 2007.  If required, a subsequent SIR will provide further qualification criteria to enable the FAA to evaluate and then down-select vendors for the QVL.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of vendors selected for the QVL.  Data submitted that is found to be false will result in permanent removal from consideration for this QVL.  The contracting officer will dispose of incomplete packages without further action unless an inadequate number of responses are received. The FAA reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey with companies interested in this requirement.  Special consideration may be given to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses for participation in the QVL. All vendors being considered for inclusion on the QVL must meet the criteria for determination of responsibility as defined in the FAA's Acquisition Management System.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must:    1. Have adequate resources (financial, technical, etc.) to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them;    2. Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, considering all existing business commitments;    3. Have a satisfactory performance record;    4. Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and    5. Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. The FAA reserves the right to request business and financial references to aid in the determination of responsibility. Re-establishment of this QVL will be a unilateral decision of the FAA and will be reviewed annually.  The FAA reserves the right to include additional vendors on the QVL.  The decision to remove a vendor from this QVL will be based on performance and the ability to be competitive.

<CONTACT>Ms Judy Parnock, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 336-4214, Fax null, Email judy.parnock@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing Launch Services, Inc. for Launch Services in support of the AEHF-2, MUOS-1, NROL-27 and NROL-49 missions.  The four (4) missions will be added to the existing Lockheed Martin and Boeing EELV Launch Services contracts.  These four (4) Launch Services will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required).  The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  The Government may elect not to award any of the launch services (described above) as a result of these solicitations.  A J&A was approved based upon FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) which states, ?When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.?  FAR 6-301(a)(2)(iii) goes on to state, ?Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in ? (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.?  And FAR 6.302-3(a)(i) states, ?Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization.?  The J&A permits Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to Lockheed Martin and Boeing, subject to the Competition in Contracting Act. Any other interested parties (or new entrants) must, at a minimum before being considered a responsible prospective contractor for any EELV launch services contracts, (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal, (2) have successfully demonstrated two (2) missions (intermediate or larger) that insert payloads into their intended orbits, (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) and presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3, and (4) successfully complete a two-part evaluation, at their own expense, per the attached new entrant capability criteria.  Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, including small business firms, are encouraged to submit a statement of capability(limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to:  LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Judy Parnock, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business.  Prior EELV experience has shown that the time period for a new entrant to demonstrate it is a responsible prospective contractor  may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the missions identified in this NOCA.  Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and attached new entrant capability criteria to initiate activity towards demonstrating responsibility.  Other than the responsibility requirements to be met by contractors before award of these specific launch services, no formal qualification requirements have been established, but the government reserves the right to do so at a later date. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award any contracts on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. See note 22. Attachment. EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV), NEW ENTRANT CAPABILITY CRITERIA, EELC Launch Service (ELS) Contract. A "new entrant", any potential launch service provider other than current EELV Lockheed Atlas V or Boeing Delta IV contractors. System requirements for new entrant: Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) (AFSPC requirements); System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD)(contract version); Standard Interface Specification (SIS) (SV interface to LV). A new entrant is responsible for all system design and development; no direction or authority for Air Force to fund.  A new entrant must successfully complete a two part Air Force evaluation to be considered: Part 1 Top level assessment of business and technical capability; Part 2 Critical Design Review level of maturity (for all EELV payload classes as defined in the SPRD)(firms interested in a copy of the SPRD should send a written request to the PCO); Including demonstration of two (2) successful EELV intermediate or larger class launches.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to provide National Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) certification training to all newly hired civilian personnel and military personnel recently transferred to VTS.  It is estimated that 40 to 80 students per year will be trained in the following subjects.  Course subjects in Professional Maritime training include Shiphandling (Basic, Advanced, and Emergency), Bridge Resource Management, Automatic RADAR Plotting Aids, Electronic Chart Displays, Watchkeeping, and RADAR Observer.  These courses are required to be taught using a combined Vessel Traffic Control simulator and Shipboard simulator.  The combined simulators allow students in the Vessel Traffic Control simulator to control the traffic and interact with students operating up to eight simulated vessels in the Shipboard simulator.  MITAGS is the only known facility in the United States having such a combined simulator installed.  Upon completion of the courses, VTS watch standers shall possess knowledge of shipboard operations; including the functions, capabilities, and limitations of the ship's bridge team members, along with an understanding of the resources at their disposal.  The VTS watch stander must also understand typical forces and vessel characteristics involved in ship handling and marine navigation.  The period of performance is a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The purpose of this mod is to correct the Contracting Office Address.  The correct address should read: "Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, NAVFAC Southwest,Utility/Energy Contracts Team.

The Navy is conducting a market research to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to purchasing renewable power for Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, located adjacent to Ridgecrest, CA.  Specifically, the Navy desires to purchase power generated from a photovoltaic (PV) system located on base, developed and constructed by a private entity or entities.  The intent of the Navy is to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the acquisition of approximately 22 megawatts (MW) of power, without any interest in the ownership of the PV system. The objective would be to incorporate all available Federal and State incentives or rebates for this type of renewable system into the project in order to maximize cost competitiveness with current electricity commodity. The desired location for the system is a site located on the southern portion of the base.  This potential agreement would also allow entities to sell power off-base to parties other than the Navy. Finally, it is the Navy?s desire to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. The Navy purchases power for NAWS China Lake from Southern California Edison under Rate Schedule TOU-8. The Service Voltage is 33,000 volts.

NAWS China Lake is an aviation facility, and a potential PV development may be located within approach and departure flight paths. The Navy is interested in the potential impacts, if any, related to the existence of photovoltaic systems within critical flight zones. The Navy is seeking responses to this RFI that will include comments on the potential impact to aviation from these types of systems.

Specifically, the Navy is interested in identifying risks associated with awarding a PPA for NAWS China Lake, including; awarding a PPA within a timeframe where current Federal Tax Credits can be applied.  The current deadline for receiving the Solar Tax Credit is December 2008.  Perceived risks are Federal Tax Credits, project developer relationship with local utility company, impact of tariffs and associated costs for developing a large PV system, supply of PV materials, construction timelines, and capital financing availability. Comments on Renewable Energy Credits are of particular interest to the Navy. In the event that a REC market were to be created in California, how would industry incorporate the value into the project? In that scenario, would the Navy be able to retain any RECs?  

The Navy requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest with responses to the attached questionaire and as a minimum supply the following information:  (1) Name and location of company, type of business, (2) capability and pertinent experience, (3) financial capacity to develop and construct a PV system of desired magnitude and (4) points of contact.  Elaborate responses are neither required nor desired.  Any innovative and/or new conceptual ideas and recommendations for PPA alternatives are highly encouraged.  All information submitted will be considered proprietary and confidential.  The Statement of Interest is due 15 days after this posting date.  The maximum length of the Statement is 7 pages.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. NAVFAC SW IS REQUESTING ASSISTANCE FROM THE INDUSTRY IN THE PREPARATION OF A PPA FOR PV GENERATED POWER CONTRACT. YOUR ANSWERS TO THE ATTACHED QUESTIONAIRE MAY BE USED TO TAILOR THE PROPOSED SOLICITATION DESCRIBED HEREIN. POC: MS. REA CARLOS (REA.CARLOS@NAVY.MIL) OR MR. EDWARD THIBODO (EDWARD.THIBODO@NAVY.MIL). MS. CARLOS CAN BE REACHED AT 619-532-1103 OR MR. THIBODO CAN BE REACHED  AT 619-532-4243.  RESPONSES TO THIS RFI SHOULD BE E-MAILED AND SENT TO THEIR ATTENTION AT:  NAVFAC SOUTHWEST, 1220 PACIFIC HIGHWAY, BUILDING 110, SAN DIEGO, CA,  92132.
 

STATEMENT OF INTEREST QUESTIONAIRE:

The primary purpose of this RFI is to seek discussion and feedback on these issues/ questions:

1.	Incorporation of all available Federal and State incentives and rebates, impacts to the type of project discussed, and any concerns or risks.
2.	Renewable energy credit (REC) impacts to this type project. Provide comments on the current state of RECs in California and economic impacts of retaining RECs if a market is created in California that allows sale and trading. Would the economics of this type project in a REC market allow for the Navy to retain any of the RECs?
3.	Impacts to aviation from large photovoltaic systems installed in and around critical aviation corridors adjacent to runways.
4.	Sale of electricity from the type of project discussed above to parties other than the Navy. 
5.	Assuming the 22MW peak load requirement for the Navy, and considering Issue #3, potentially what size system might industry envision.
6.	Alternate arrangements for Power Purchase Agreements for NAWS China Lake that do not include development of the renewable energy resource on Navy land. 

The Navy would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to parties other than the Navy is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of PV system would be envisioned. Potentially available land areas on NAWS China Lake are being identified, which may allow for development of a system capacity larger than the Navy?s requirement of 22MW.  Furthermore, the Navy requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site would be unspecified.   Responses should include considerations of site and location, total land area requirements, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the Navy.

<CONTACT>Deja Craddock, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-512-9078, Fax null, Email craddockd@gao.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to modify the response date for the synopsis from August 15, 2006 to July 28, 2006 in accordance with Note 22 for publishing a synopsis for 45 Days meaning "Calendar Days".

The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Hummingbird Ltd., 1 Sparks Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M2H 2W1, Canada, for the purchase of Hummingbird Platinum level Technical Support.  

The Period of Performance of the order will be comprised of the Base Year October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, and four subsequent option years.  Platinum level support supplements GAO’s installed base of Hummingbird DM and RM client software, of which GAO owns and maintains 4,000 seats.  Platinum Support includes services over and above standard maintenance, such as a dedicated Technical Account Manager, 24x7 technical support access, site visits, multiple program staff contacts, and guaranteed response times for technical support questions. Since GAO deploys Hummingbird DM/RM software on the enterprise level, having timely and dedicated technical support is warranted to ensure operational issues or support requirements are resolved in a timely manner transparent to the end-user.   

Further detail on Hummingbird’s Technical Support programs and Platinum Support may be found at www.hummingbird.com.  Hummingbird, the manufacturer of Hummingbird DM and RM software, is the sole provider of this Platinum Support.  There are no other companies known to provide similar services.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within Forty-Five (45)days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.    END

<DESC>The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) is an independent Federal government agency with responsibility for the oversight of the Department of Energy (DOE)?s defense nuclear facilities located throughout the United States.  The Board?s accounting function is provided by a federal Government service provider.  The service provider performs all of the Board?s accounting entries into their accounting system; the system data serves as the Board?s official accounting records from which all official financial data and reports (e.g., financial statements) are generated.  However, the Board has historically maintained an independent internal financial tracking system.  The Board requires a new Windows-based system using current technology that can be easily modified from an available Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) system that allows secure access by multiple users.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential sources capable of providing such a COTS system.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation notice for proposals and the Board reserves the right not to issue a solicitation or award a contract as a result of this notice; thus FIRMS SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE BY REQUESTING TO BE PLACED ON A SOLICITATION MAILING LIST.  Interested sources should respond to this notice by providing a brief (not to exceed seven (7) pages) overview of the company and a summary description of the existing COTS system, to include the existing functionality and required modifications to meet the Board?s draft requirements (reference the draft Statement of Work posted with this synopsis).  In addition, the submitted information shall include references of current customers utilizing the COTR product. 

The requested information shall be submitted via electronic mail to markw@dnfsb.gov by 4:00 p.m. on June 29, 2007.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice and respondents will not be notified of the results of the Board?s review of the submitted information.

PROJECT PHASE INFORMATION:   This project consists of three phases.  Phase I consists of approximately a 3.2-mile reach extending from the Pima Freeway (US 101), upstream to immediately upstream of the Mckellips Road.  River restoration features proposed for Phase I include cottonwood /willow, open water, wetlands areas and the new river bottom.  Linear Recreation facilities are included as  part of Phase I.     Phase II includes approximately a 3.5-mile reach located immediate upstream of Phase I, extending from McKellips Road upstream to just east of Gilbert Road.  Restoration features planned for this reach are similar to those for Phase I and include new Mesqu ite areas. Phase III covers the area immediately upstream of Phase II extending from Gilbert Road upstream to just east of Val Vista Drive.  Restoration features to be designed for this reach are similar to Phase I and II, and includes extensive removal of exotic spe cies and replacement with native vegetation.  The estimated construction cost for Va Shly ay Akimel is approximately $138,968,000.00. PROJECT INFORMATION:   The Va Shly ay Akimel Salt River Ecosystem Restoration Project is located in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC) adjacent to the City of Mesa in Maricopa County, Arizona, about 18 miles east of downtown of Phoenix.   The overall project is approximately 14 miles long extending from immediately downstream of the Granite Reef Dam to the Pima Freeway (US 101), and averaged 1,500 feet wide.

<DESC>NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking partners to develop proposals for the NASA Headquarters Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) 2007 Partnership Seed Fund Call for Proposals.	Information on this Call for Proposals is available at the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (http://prod.nais.nasa.gov) and Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) Web Sites under the Title FY2007 IPP SEED FUND CALL ANNOUNCEMENT posted on May 10, 2007. NASA KSC is specifically seeking Partner(s) to participate with NASA KSC Scientists to develop and execute a proposal for the following technology area: RADIO FREQUENCY GEOLOCATION SYSTEM- KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and field testing of a radio frequency geolocation system, which locates transmitters operating between 1 MHz and 18 GHz that interfere with the Range RADAR System, Range Flight Termination System, Trunking Radio System, and other Land Mobile Radios.  The proposed relocation system would assist RF (radio frequency) sensitive spacecraft operators in understanding the environment for the purpose of avoiding over exposure to RF, and to gauge the response to any overexposure. The objective is for the geolocation system to interoperate with leading RF surveillance systems through an open Application Programming Interface (API), and receive requests from and send results to the surveillance system across an ethernet connection employing TCP/IP. In addition to communication with the surveillance system, it is intended for this ethernet network to be used by the geolocation system to support a W3C conforming web browser user interface which includes display mapping of geolocation results.	Figures of merit for this system  include location accuracy, time-to-locate, automatic doppler compensation, minimum discernable signal, and tolerance of multipath effects, in addition to typical figures of merit for the sensor(s) such as dynamic range, sensitivity, and selectivity.  Qualifying partners must have experience in the development and field testing of radio frequency geolocation systems. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates.  Potential partner(s) must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the requirements for the Radio Frequency Geolocation System KSC Technology Area. Partner(s) must work collaboratively with NASA. Partner selection(s) will be made by KSC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Cost sharing – This criterion evaluates the proposer’s cost-sharing level and quality.  (4) Facilities. This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to two (2) pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses shall be submitted to: John F. Kennedy Space Center, Attn: James Nichols, Mail Code KT-A2, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899; or via email to: James.D.Nichols@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is June 21, 2007. Technical questions shall be directed to James Nichols at the email address noted above. Procurement questions shall be directed to Krista Jensen, NASA KSC Procurement Office, Krista.Y.Jensen@nasa.gov.

These models have been developed to operate on a SUN UNIX platform running Solaris operating system. One of the models, Joint Integrated Contingency Model, has been developed to operate on a SUN UNIX platform only.  In support of this effort the 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB issues this Request for Information for planning purposes only.  This Request for Information is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  The purpose of this Request for Information is to identify potential alternatives to the SUN UNIX platform that are capable of running Solaris Operating System 8, 9, or 10 to use the analytical models including the Joint Integrated Contingency Model.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of 6 CONS and CCJ8 evaluations of the information received.

<DESC>NREL On-Site Photovoltaic (PV) Project

Opportunity Announcement

June 6, 2007

Summary:

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in Golden, Colorado and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office (GO) are seeking opportunities to collaborate with a solar energy project developer for the purpose of developing an on-site solar electricity generation project at NREL. Development of this project is encouraged by a utility incentive program that was implemented in Colorado for purposes of compliance with Colorado's Renewable Energy Standard (RES). The Colorado Legislature recently increased the RES to require higher percentages of solar electricity generation by qualifying retail utilities. Though not subject to the RES, DOE and NREL are customers of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Xcel), a major U.S. investor-owned electric and natural gas utility with regulated operations in Colorado that is subject to compliance with the RES. Prospective developers responding to this Opportunity Announcement must be willing to prepare and submit a proposal to Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program as a third-party developer for a customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) system at NREL. 

Project Structure:

DOE and NREL expect the developer to be capable of designing, financing and installing a ground-mounted PV system that can produce a minimum of 1,200 MWH per year. The system will be located on Federal government property at NREL's South Table Mountain (STM) site in Golden, Colorado. Approximately five acres of land will be available for the project. In addition, DOE and NREL expect the developer to own, operate and maintain the PV system for at least twenty years. In addition to the ground-mounted system, other opportunities may exist to develop roof-mounted PV projects on existing DOE-owned buildings at NREL, as well as on buildings currently in the design phase for which construction has not yet begun. 

Based on prior Xcel Request for Proposals (RFP), DOE and NREL anticipate that the financial structure for the project will include the following elements: (1) a 20-year power purchase agreement for DOE to purchase the entire electricity output of the PV system; (2) a one-time rebate payment from Xcel to the developer in the amount of $2.00 per watt for up to a maximum of 100 kW per system, payable upon confirmation of the Commercial Operation Date; (3) monthly payments from Xcel to the developer for all Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SO-RECs) generated for a 20-year period; and (4) any Federal or state tax credits for which the developer may be eligible. 

 
Prospective developers must be willing to enter into specific agreements with various parties which may be involved in the successful execution of this project. These agreements include the following: (1) a no-cost easement with DOE for access to the land; (2) a power purchase agreement with the Western Area Power Administration (Western) for the electricity generated by the ground-mounted PV system; (3) a site use agreement with the NREL Division of the Midwest Research Institute for installation, operation and maintenance activities conducted at the site; (4) a third-party rebate contract with Xcel; and (5) a third-party SO-REC contract with Xcel for all SO-RECs generated.

Project Selection and Timing:

While no announcement has yet occurred for 2007, DOE and NREL expect Xcel to issue another RFP for customer-sited PV generating facilities above 100 kW and up to 2 MW DC under Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program. Typically, Xcel provides very short response times for proposal preparation after an RFP is released. In order to allow more time for developers to prepare a proposal for submission to Xcel, DOE and NREL intend to identify solar project developers prior to Xcel's release of an RFP. Because of the financial incentives offered through Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program, future execution of this project depends on the developer's proposal being selected by Xcel under an upcoming RFP.

Based on responses to this Opportunity Announcement, DOE and NREL intend to select two or three solar project developers. The selected developers will be given more detailed site information and a site tour for their use in preparing a more detailed proposal for submission to Xcel. DOE has begun an environmental assessment (EA) for this project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The EA will be completed by DOE at no cost to the developer. DOE and NREL will allow the developers flexibility to decide the level of effort they wish to put into proposal preparation prior to issuance of an RFP by Xcel. All proposal preparation and development costs are to be borne by the developer. At such time as Xcel issues an RFP, DOE and NREL will ask the developers to submit their final proposals to DOE and NREL for review. Based on this review, DOE and NREL will cooperate to select one developer who will then submit its proposal to Xcel. All selection decisions will be final and are within the sole discretion of DOE and NREL. 

Based on past experience, DOE and NREL expect that Xcel's process will be highly competitive and their selection criteria will be based largely on SO-REC price. Prospective developers are encouraged to create a financial structure for the project aimed at minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated.

 
Response Requirements:

Response length is limited to two, double-sided pages, 8.5 in. x 11 in., with no smaller than 12 point font and 1 inch margins. 

Responses shall include the following information:

Past Experience. DOE and NREL will consider past experience in financing, designing, installing, owning, operating, and maintaining PV systems of similar size and complexity. The developer must have experience with a minimum of one installed and operating PV system of at least 500 kW. If the developer forms a joint venture or other teaming arrangement, these same considerations will be applied to the parties to the joint venture or teaming arrangement cumulatively. Additional response information may be included such as: 

(1)	More extensive experience with PV projects, including projects under power purchase agreements. 
(2)	Experience with Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program.
(3)	Experience with Federal government projects.

Pricing Approach. Explain the approach for minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated. 
 
Proposed PV System Technical Specifications. Describe the type of PV cells, efficiency, mounting, tracking method if used, interconnection plan, and recommended provisions to minimize PV system visibility (including light reflection) for the ground-mounted system. 

Financial Capability. Provide verifiable information demonstrating that the developer is in sound financial condition and has the ability to secure the necessary financing to meet the project's requirements now and in the future. The developer's financial capability will be reviewed for stability and adequacy to meet its long-term capital and cash needs to own, operate, and maintain the PV system. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel and plans to secure financing from an outside source, an official letter from the financier confirming the financial arrangement will be required. 

PV Supply. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel, the developer must provide a letter from its PV supplier and/or manufacturer substantiating the availability of PV modules for the project.
 

Response Submission:

Eight (8) paper copies and one digital copy as a single PDF file must be received by 4:00 PM Mountain Time, on July 3, 2007, at the address below.

<DESC>Program Description:
The United States Mint has a requirement for coils of metal strip to be used as raw material for producing coins in the following denominations (5?, 10?, 25?, 50? and $1) for the United States Mint.
The raw material acquired must produce coins that are compatible with existing coinage in circulation within the vending, banking, commerce as well as the general public.  The raw material breaks down into three separate alloys, one homogeneous and two 3-ply clad manufacturing processes.  The five-cent (Cupro-Nickel) alloy is a homogeneous alloy composed of 75% Copper (Cu) and 25% nickel (Ni).  The 10, 25 and 50 cent coins are made from a 3-ply composition (Cupro-Nickel-Clad), comprised of two exterior layers of 75% Cu - 25% Ni with a pure copper core.  The $1 alloy (Nickel-Manganese-Brass) is a 3-ply composition, with the two exterior layers composed of Cu, Ni, Zinc (Zn) and Manganese (Mn) with a pure copper core.
Each of the 3-ply alloy compositions must be metallurgically bonded to ensure there is no possibility of separation within the layers.  The Cupro-Nickel-Clad alloy and process was developed to replace previous coins, made from coining silver, and designed to function seamlessly in the vending industry.  The Golden dollar alloy was developed to replace and function in the vending industry as the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.

General specifications for United States Mint coinage strip:
Thickness: 0.041 in. - 0.0685 in.
Width: 12 9/16? - 13 ??
Coil size: 4,000 - 10,000 pounds, (nominal >7,000 pounds)

Estimated volume requirements:    				
Denomination		Annual Volume
Pounds	Weekly Volume
Pounds
5-cent	40%	8,000,000	160,000
	60%	12,500,000	250,000
			
10,25,50-cent	40%	25,000,000	500,000
	60%	37,000,000	750,000
			
$1 Golden	40%	8,000,000	160,000
	60%	12,000,000	240,000

In addition, the Mint generates approximately 25% of the above volume as scrap.  The contractor must be able to recycle and use returned scrap from the coining process as feed stock for future coinage strip.





This is a contract for goods or services necessary for carrying out the programs or operations of the United States Mint.  Provisions of law governing procurement or public contracts shall not be applicable to the procurement of goods or services necessary for carrying out United States Mint programs and operations.  See 31 U.S.C. ? 5136.

You will not receive responses to questions or comments.

<DESC>A.	 General Information      The Pacific Region (TRBO Reg 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreem ent Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Scrub Brush.  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.      This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agr eement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ i s a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is February 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be det ermined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst, 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Scrub Brush. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $50,969.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information , and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network s ecurity, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for r esubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the  deciding officials for this initiative.   Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  After review of the tec hnical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.   Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship sa mples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.    Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB h as set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. T he Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.

<DESC>Description - This is a Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice to identify manufacturers with a capability with miniaturized electronics technology in high speed data recorders suitable for the measurement of human injury mechanisms associated  with blast and impact. The device is intended to be worn or mounted to Soldier helmets and would measure acceleration shock during blast events. Device would not present any harm to the individual wearing the recorder device. The candidate technologies su bmitted for consideration would allow measurement of head (not merely helmet) acceleration during an impact or sudden motion scenario for soldiers engaged in their normal or combat activities in the field while wearing their standard issue equipment.  As h ead acceleration has long been considered to be a measure of brain trauma; our ultimate goal is to not merely capture data from which to improve protection schemes of the future, but also to understand the threshold of concussion and other brain injury due  to direct (or indirect) head impacts.  We are not aware of any system that is available to measure either local or global brain deformation in either discreet events or cumulative intervals. The government is seeking to improve the current Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) into a system that is capable of collecting both acceleration and other input data including pressure/temperature.  The concept is to create an unobtrusive/unencumbered data coll ection system that can be used in the field to understand and characterize the effects of blast on brain injury.  Key features of this system include the ability to store seconds/minutes worth of continuous data to ensure primary, secondary, and tertiary e ffects of blast are captured while featuring low power consumption via some power management mechanism for long term use without requiring intervention, and a high data sample rate with multiple channels of data.  Our primary objective is to ascertain the state-of-industry with respect to achieving a fully plug-and-use system for the soldier while balancing the needs of the researchers and medical personnel. Basic features: (1) Data recorder - record and accurately characterize blast/shock events with frequency content 10  100 kHz and pressure -20 to 500 PSI with appropriate anti-alias hardware filtering with a potentially six degree of freedom acceleration e vent of 0 to 1000-6000 g and 0 to 50,000 rad/s2), (acceleration levels with a potential risk of  injury from falls, motor vehicle crashes, blast and ballistic events) (2) Packaging  small with ability to insert/attach into helmets or worn on body (ear), s ize  small, less than 2 inch diameter and less than 1 inch thick.  Total system mass including power supply should be less than 250 g (3) Power - operations  self powered, portable, with ability to operate for duration of several months, ease of battery replacement and longer battery performance a desirable trade off.  The system should have no data loss or breaks with cumulative data tracks by having to change power supply (4) Low maintenance, (5) data retrieval  means to download, retrieve data evaluat e the data gathered to determine health limits/thresholds (6) Producibility  ability to be produced in quantity and cost effective (7) Desirable - seek concepts on how to integrate the item into the existing Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH). (8) Technologies demonstrated should consistently perform in shock, vibration, electro-magnetic, and thermal environmental conditions typical of Army field operations today. (9) It is desirable that technologies demonstrated operate passively and do not increase RF signatu res. (10) Information capture within candidate technologies should register a high-degree of resolution or forecasting in data recorded along an impact axis that is oblique relative to the xyz frames of reference. (11) Candidate technologies should not int erfere with operations/performance of other equipage a combat  soldier might utilize (e.g. radio). Background  Agencies such as DARPA hosted discussions related to the goal of better understanding blast injuries that are occurring in the theater.  It is clear that there are a large number of head injuries occurring due to direct impact from ordinance o r shrapnel, and blast induced injuries due to pressure waves.  We need to review technologies that are designed or can be applied to measurement of the REAL impacts that occur in the field.  We believe these data can be used to help improve combat helmet d esign, situational protocols/procedures, and other human engineering factors. Furthermore, we believe that existing technology will allow field commanders to know, in real-time, if their soldiers have sustained a head injury which requires medical attentio n (i.e. technology is as much a performance monitor as it is an injury monitor).  Eventual fielding of these technologies to front line units that are likely to sustain blast injuries in the theatre may provide instant field feedback on performance and injury. Ideally, use of available technologies will provide critically sought bio-eng ineering and medically clinical (diagnostic and prognostic) information on the actual blast environment in a non-obtrusive way -.  Additionally, instrumented helmets can be used in jump training at Ft. Benning, and in other training environments to protect  the Army's investment in its soldiers and to better understand training or combat-related injuries.  All of this real time information would also be used to better define next generation helmet design for reducing the incidence and severity of brain injur y. This is a high priority item for the Army. Participation Requirements - Source must have a functional system. To be considered for this sources sought, the source must submit technical information in a 2  10 page paper, and test data explaining the performance of their system, to include the techn ical approach and system operations. Sources must prepare a separate 2 page paper describing manufacturing capability, cost and delivery schedule, and capability to produce. Source must also present their operational demonstration model and paper during th e period tentative scheduled 26 June  6 July 2007 to PM Soldier Equipment. Include all appropriate MSDS sheets/ safety/ health information. Source must submit all required information no later than 22 June 2007, item may be hand carried to briefing demons tration.       Evaluation Process - This is a sources sought notice seeking potential technology sources for high speed event recorder. This process may not lead to a procurement or contract of any kind. All submitted items/information will be reviewed to ensure complian ce with the stated sources sought notice. The government reserves the right to perform additional tests on all submitted items. Submitted information will not be returned. Demonstration models will be returned. It may be requested to retain the item for cl arification for a short period. This is not a request for proposal or quotation. No solicitation document exists. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items. If as a source you can meet these qualifications please submit all required information and samples by COB 22 June 2007 to PM Soldier Equipment, Attn: MAJ Bob Schaffer, APM, PM Soldier Survivability, 10170 Beach Road, Building 328T, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Naval Air Systems Command, Aviation Support Equipment Program Office (PMA260) requests information which will serve as a market and technology survey to assist NAVAIR in developing its acquisition strategy for a full and open competition to develop a replacement system for the existing mainframe Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) AN/USM-636 (V) Test Station with a next generation test station, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS). 
  

General Description: The CASS mission is to provide a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for the purpose of performing automated avionics testing at Navy Intermediate (Ship and Shore) and Depot-Level maintenance sites. Current CASS test stations are approaching the end of their service life. The vision is that eCASS will include two station variants: 
1) A Radio Frequency (RF) station comprised of digital, low frequency, power, control, radio frequency and communication subsystems and; 2) A Hybrid station capable of supporting CASS Electro-Optics (EO) test requirements by hosting the existing CASS EO3 console.  The Hybrid station shall be a logistically common subset of the RF station tailored to support EO weapon system Test Program Sets (TPSs). 
 

The RF test station will be compatible for use with the existing CASS High Power Device Test Set (HPDTS) and the future Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) Ancillary Set, currently under development.  Existing and new CASS ancillary equipment shall be used with the two variants (Hybrid and RF) to meet the full range of testing currently performed on all CASS test station variants.   eCASS shall be designed for shipboard use and shall be compliant with the draft eCASS specification and other applicable DoN documentation.  eCASS shall be capable of supporting existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) for approximately 2000 avionics components.  The station shall be designed to minimize any changes to TPSs and to maintain or improve the fidelity of test, run-times, and performance.  The offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for migration to eCASS. The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and an eCASS mode that includes the full complement of station capabilities. 


The Government is defining its acquisition strategy to operationally field eCASS test stations to the warfighter to replace the existing CASS stations starting no later than CY15.  The Request For Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued in third (3rd) Quarter of Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 08 with an anticipated contract award in early second (2nd) Quarter of GFY 09.  The contract type will be either Fixed Price, Cost Plus, or a combination of both. Based on our current understanding of industry capabilities a three-year System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) phase is projected to include qualification testing followed by Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I & II builds.  The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include efforts to design, test and produce Two (2) Hybrid and Two (2) RF pre-production test stations primarily used for qualification testing. The anticipated LRIP I &II quantities may consist of Two to Four (2-4) Hybrid and Ten to Sixteen (10-16) RF test stations each to support TPS regression and operational testing. The Navy plans to separately award follow-on contract(s) for the remaining production quantity of Seventy to Eighty (70-80) Hybrid and Three Hundred to Three Hundred Twenty (300-320) RF test stations.  


Nominal schedule: -Industry day 09/2007 (Information to be provided via separate announcement); - RFP Release Third (3rd) Quarter of GFY08; -Contract award; - early Second (2nd) Quarter GFY09; - 3 year SD&D Phase; - 12-20 unit LRIP each in 2011 and 2012; - Operational Testing 2012-2013; - FRP 2014 (35-50 Stations/Year).

<DESC>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Hummingbird Ltd., 1 Sparks Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M2H 2W1, Canada, for the purchase of Hummingbird Platinum level Technical Support.  

The Period of Performance of the order will be comprised of the Base Year October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, and four subsequent option years.  Platinum level support supplements GAO’s installed base of Hummingbird DM and RM client software, of which GAO owns and maintains 4,000 seats.  Platinum Support includes services over and above standard maintenance, such as a dedicated Technical Account Manager, 24x7 technical support access, site visits, multiple program staff contacts, and guaranteed response times for technical support questions. Since GAO deploys Hummingbird DM/RM software on the enterprise level, having timely and dedicated technical support is warranted to ensure operational issues or support requirements are resolved in a timely manner transparent to the end-user.   

Further detail on Hummingbird’s Technical Support programs and Platinum Support may be found at www.hummingbird.com.  Hummingbird, the manufacturer of Hummingbird DM and RM software, is the sole provider of this Platinum Support.  There are no other companies known to provide similar services.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within Forty-Five (45)days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.    END

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name NIKSUN NETVCR 3500
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure "brand name" Niksun 3500 Series NetVCR appliance and software to monitor traffic on USPTO's OHRNET/OFDNET II, at multiple connection points to provide clear visibility of traffic flows, traffic analysis and troubleshooting capabilities.  This announcement is considered a "brand name" justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). NIKSUN NetVCR provides a single integrated solution for proactive end-to-end network management.  NetVCR's enterprise-wide integrated approach simplifies end-to-end network and application performance monitoring and troubleshooting, by offering full network visibility passively (non-intrusive), exceptional drill-down forensic analysis, integrated performance reports on all traffic, "add-as-you-grow" unlimited storage, secure and easy to use web interface, and extensive 3rd party compatibility. NetVCR appliances are shipped with all the software features installed but disabled out of the box. Software features are unlocked only by installing the purchased license keys from NIKSUN. NetVCR can be considered the recording device that captures traffic, stores everything in realtime, and has the ability to further break down that information into easy-to-understand data that can be access securely via a web browser. NetVCR is adaptive to a wide variety of network interfaces, they are: 10/100 copper Ethernet, gigabit copper Ethernet, fiber Ethernet, HSSI (High Speed Serial Interface), ATM, Packet over SONet, T1, T3, OC3, OC12, multilink PPP, ISL (Inter-Switch Link) and 802.1q.  There is an existing installation of NIKSUN NetVCR, NetX appliances monitoring TRINET traffic. NetX is the enterprise reporting appliance that collects statistics data from remote NetVCR appliances enabling centralized reporting. When NetVCR appliances are installed in the OHRNET/OFDNET II network, the existing NetX, which has more than sufficient available processing cycles, can be configured to poll statistics data from them to generate specific reports, leverage data for optimization, and trending.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items; and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-07-128-RDB.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 443120.

It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate for professional Information Technology (IT) Microsoft? Premier Support Services (PSS) for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) for a base period of 12 months from date of award with three successive 12-month option periods.  HHS requires Microsoft PSS to support its Microsoft enterprise software which includes responding to software fixes, patches, problem resolution and configuration modifications.  CIT operates and manages HHS enterprise software license agreements, including the HHS Microsoft EA, which is utilized by HHS Operating Divisions including NIH, CDC, FDA and ITSC.  Microsoft PSS is required to provide software maintenance and support for over 60,000 HHS computer desktop personal computers and laptops, as well as several hundred HHS servers.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This acquisition will be made as a Brand Name or Equal purchase.  Each quote must meet the requirements defined in FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal, see attached documents.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Solicitation number FA7000-07-T-0173, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16, effective 22 Mar 2007 and Class Deviation 2005-000001.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 334516 and the business size is 500 employees.  The proposed acquisition is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  This Notice of Proposed Contract Action is the only solicitation submitted for this requirement.  No formal solicitation will be issued prior to award.

10 MSG/LGCB has a requirement for an X-Ray Diffraction Unit as follows:

The Government has a requirement to purchase one (1) MPD Theta / Theta Powder X-ray Diffraction System.   The Powder X-ray Diffraction System will be used in  Advanced Laboratory Techniques and Independent Research courses.   A suitable EQUAL must be able to meet all of the following criteria:

a. The Powder X-ray Diffraction System must have a complete radiation enclosure which prevents exposure from either the direct or scattered x-ray beam.  The enclosure must meet all local, state, and federal x-ray radiation safety requirements.  

b. Key lock to prevent unauthorized use of the system.
  
c. Manual adjustment of generator settings available on the exterior of the enclosure.  Generator settings must be restricted and password protected, software selectable, and computer control.

d. Enclosure with front sliding doors for convenient access to the goniometer, optics and sample stage. These doors must lock automatically when the x-ray shutter is open, so that it is physically impossible to open them.

e. Enclosure with safety interlocked hinged rear doors for easy access to the goniometer.

f. An X-ray tube of the long fine focus design (0.4 x 12 mm filament size) with a maximum loading of 2.2 kW.  The tube shall have a copper anode and shall have ceramic insulation that provides superior focal stability over glass tubes.  The tube must be of the high stability variety for the more demanding requirements of a x-ray mirror.  

g. An X-ray  tube and tube shield design which allows for fast and easy changeover between line and point focus operation as required for different analytical techniques in less than 10 minutes, by individuals who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics, without the need for realignment of the tube, optics or goniometer.  The changeover must be accomplished by loosening a locking ring at the base of the x-ray tube, rotating the tube 90„a and locking the ring.  Disconnecting water lines as part of this procedure is not acceptable.

h.  An x-ray tube that is constructed with a solid state device that allows the diffractometer/generator control electronics to automatically recognize the model number of the tube when the tube is installed in the system.

i.  An X-ray tube stand which contains an electro-magnetic shutter mechanism with fail-safe interlocks.

j.	Must include an x-ray generator that is capable of 3.0 kW output power and the use of ultra-sonic frequency solid state technology with remote computer control and tube recognition through the diffractometer/generator control electronics.  It must allow pre-set kV and mA values to be used for different analytical programs and also allow the user to program a standby setting (minimal kV and mA) for when the diffractometer is not being used.  Automatic control of all important operation parameters must also be included. 

k.	Generator must have a adjustable kV setting to 60 kV maximum output in 1 kV steps at a stability of less than 0.01% at mains variation of +/- 10%.  The mA setting must be adjustable to 60 mA output in 1 mA steps at a stability of less than +/- 0.01% at mains variation of +/- 10%. 

l.	The diffractometer/generator control electronics must be able to automatically identify the model number of the tube currently installed.  Based on the model number of the tube, the generator will establish and restrict the maximum kV, mA and power settings that can be applied to the tube.  The control electronics must maintain a running log of the usage of all tubes installed on the system.  Each tube will have a separate log file, organized by tube serial number.  Log files will track the hours each tube is used at different power levels, based on a combination of kV and mA.  

m.	Diffractometer must consist of a very stable vertical theta / theta goniometer with a measuring circle radius that  is variable from 170 to 240 mm.

n.	The diffractometer must have independent operation of the drive axes for the tube (omega) and detector (theta) arms.  The angular range of the goniometer must be from -40 to +200 degrees in omega, and from -15 to +165 degrees in theta, depending on accessories. 

o.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System?s goniometer must employ direct optical positioning technology using DC drive motors for the omega and theta axes, 360 degree optical discs bonded directly to the moving axes (tube arm/omega and detector arm/theta) and LED readout banks mounted on the goniometer chassis.  The DC motors and optical positioning technology must be under continuous operation to avoid any possibility of angular drift.  

p.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System should be capable of correcting inadvertent operator induced movements of the tube arm (omega) or detector arm (theta), momentarily pushing it out of its original angular position, the system must immediately detect this and automatically move the tube or detector to its original angular position, with no operator intervention.   The use of an optical encoding system that is not positioned directly on the tube and detector arms, such as optical encoders placed on the gear train or on the drive motor shafts, is not acceptable.

q.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System must use a pre-aligned, fast interchange optics modules for the incident x-ray beam, with each module attached to identical incident beam sub frames (individual).  The optics mounting frames must be made of hardened steel and remounting of optics must be reproducible to < 3 microns.  Interchange of each optics assembly must occur in under 2 minutes by persons who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics and without the need for realignment of the goniometer or optics modules.  The exchange of the modules must be accomplished by the loosening and tightening of no more than one screw, using no more than one tool that is provided with the diffractometer.  

r.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System  must use pre-aligned, fast interchange optics modules for the diffracted beam arm, with each module attached to identical diffracted beam sub frames (individual).  The optics mounting frames must be made of hardened steel and be reproducible to <3 microns.   The Powder X-ray Diffraction System?s interchange of each optic must occur in under 2 minutes by persons who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics and without the need for realignment of the goniometer or optics module.  The exchange of the modules must be accomplished by the loosening and tightening of no more than one screw using no more than one tool that is provided with the diffractometer.  

s. The Powder X-ray Diffraction System  must have a programmable anti scatter slit module, for use with the X?Celerator solid state linear array position sensitive detector.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

<DESC>Open Competition ? Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ? F1STAB7113B001

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 2007-01-22.  NAICS is 488190 with a small business size standard of $6.50M per year.  Solicitation is for aircraft painting services. 

This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  

AFFTC/PKAEB, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing the following: SERVICE
                           
1.1	 General Description.  The contractor shall provide aircraft painting services for an L-23 sailplane. The contractor shall provide services and facilities to repaint the aircraft.  Once completed, the aircraft must still be able to fulfill all current mission requirements.

1.2	Sailplane Description.  The sailplane is an L-23 Super Blanik, registration number N268BA.  A three view drawing of the aircraft is shown in Figure 1.  The airframe is metal with fabric covered control surfaces.  The wings and horizontal stabilizer assembly are removable.  This allows the aircraft to be placed onto a trailer and towed behind a vehicle.  The current empty weight of the sailplane is 709.9 Lbs.  Max certificated gross weight is 1124 lbs.  The paint currently on the aircraft was applied by the manufacturer approximately 10 years ago. The aircraft has never been repainted.  Figure 2 shows the aircraft?s current condition. 
 
Figure 1.  Three-view drawing of L-23 Super Blanik
Figure 2.  Pictures of L-23 in current condition

1.3	Delivery of Aircraft.  The sailplane may be delivered to the contractor in one of two ways.  

1.3.1	The preferred delivery method is by aerotow.  TPS will provide a ferry crew to fly the sailplane from its current location to the contractor facility.  The sailplane will be delivered as is.  The government will not be responsible for disassembling the aircraft to any extent.  

1.3.2	The second option is for the sailplane to be delivered via trailer.  TPS will be responsible for removing the wings and horizontal stabilizer prior to delivering the sailplane to the contractor facility. All parts will then be delivered to the contractor facility on a single open frame trailer. Under this option, the contractor may choose to keep the trailer at the contractor facility for temporary storage of parts throughout the duration of the contracted services.

1.3.3	Upon completion of services, the government will retrieve the sailplane from the contractor facility in a similar manner to how it was delivered.  The contractor is not responsible for delivering the sailplane to a government facility.

SECTION 2
CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

2.1	Laws and Regulations.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws that protect health and safety of employees and the community.  Furthermore, painting related services shall be done in accordance with all applicable regulations to include but not limited to 14 CFR parts 43 and 45.

2.2	Painter Experience.  Previous experience with painting gliders is considered highly desirable (minimum 2 aircraft).  If the contractor does not have experience painting gliders, prior experience with painting general aviation aircraft is considered adequate (minimum 3 years).  In either case, the contractor should have experienced staff available to recover fabric control surfaces if necessary.

2.3	Weight Requirements.  The aircraft is frequently operated close to its max certificated gross weight.  Any unnecessary addition of weight to the aircraft may render the aircraft incapable of fulfilling mission requirements.  Upon completion of painting services, the empty weight of the sailplane shall not be in excess of 720 Lbs.  This will ensure a useful load of greater than 400 Lbs for future operations.  Accurately weighing the aircraft after painting is the responsibility of the contractor.

2.4	Removal of Existing Paint. The contractor shall remove as much of the existing paint as possible prior to adding new paint on the sailplane.  It is preferred that the contractor remove all paint from metal surfaces via chemical or other means within the limitations of paragraph 2.1.  Though not a requirement, the contractor may choose to re-cover the fabric control surfaces rather than paint over the current fabric in order to reduce weight and remain within the requirements of paragraph 2.3.

2.5	Painting.  The contractor shall adhere to the following:

2.5.1	The contractor shall paint the aircraft to look like the VISTA aircraft flown by TPS.  This desired look is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 4 shows a simplistic drawing of what the glider may look like once painted in this scheme.  Note that Figure 4 is only a concept.  The contractor shall make all efforts to match their work to the paint scheme shown in Figure 3 with the following exceptions:

2.5.1.1	No corporate logos or names (i.e. Lockheed, General Electric, etc.) will be displayed.  However, USAF and TPS logos will be included.

2.5.1.2	The contractor is further responsible for ensuring the sailplane paint design includes all markings required by federal regulations prior to completion of the work.  Note that while the aircraft in Figure 3 does not have an N number, the glider should be painted with the number N268BA in place of the Air Force serial number.  The glider is further certified as an Experimental aircraft and must include the text ?EXPERIMENTAL? under the canopy rail in place of crew names.
2.5.1.3	The ?VISTA? label on the tail will be replaced by a larger TPS unit patch.  The small patch located on the longitudinal red stripe will be deleted.
 
Figure 3.  Photograph of aircraft with desired paint scheme
Figure 4.  Simple drawing of what glider may look like once painted

2.5.2	The contractor shall use quality polyurethane or similar paint which is durable to both inclement weather and sunlight.  Methods of reducing weight gain are highly encouraged.  For example, the contractor should attempt to paint the top of the fuselage blue without laying down a white base coat underneath as is common practice.

2.6	Timeframe.  The contractor shall complete all work within three weeks (21 calendar days) of sailplane delivery to the contractor facility.  

2.7	Location of Contractor Facility.  The Contractor facility shall be within easy transportation distance of Tehachapi, CA where the sailplane is currently located.  Under delivery option 1.3.1, this distance will be considered one hour of flight time on aerotow.  Under delivery option 1.3.2, this distance will be considered two hours of driving time.
  
NOTE: FIGURES will be provided by email from glenda.downing@edwards.af.mil.

To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

 (a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Program Manager for Monitoring and Evaluation (Program Manager for M&E) in DCHA/OTI Washington to provide direct support to OTI country programs.  The M&E Program Manager will be supervised by the OTI Program Office Team Leader.  The M&E Program Manager assist OTI's country program teams in applying OTI methodologies and approach, including rolling assessments and performance review, implementation and monitoring of activities, and evaluation of program impact, in order to improve and strengthen ongoing country program activities.  OTI estimates that 75% of the workload will be in direct support of program implementation, and 25% of the workload will be in support of strategy and evaluation of program impact.

Specifically, the Program Manager will work with OTI country programs to capture country project and program level implementation information. This information will directly contribute to program analysis and reporting.  The captured information will also help better define implementation of program activities.  Working with country teams and the Program Office, the Program Manager will be responsible for assisting country teams in conducting and facilitating rolling assessments, final evaluations, and after exit reviews.  A key tool in these efforts will be the effective use of OTI's country program database. The Program Manager will consult with OTI country program staff on the continued refinement and implementation of the OTI Country Program Performance Review, a process that is designed to monitor and document program and country-level impact of OTI activities.  The position may require up to 20% travel time.

The initial grade level of this position will be the equivalent of GS-12.  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background. Salaries above the maximum of the pay grade will not be considered.

Following two (2) years at the GS-12 equivalent grade, the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-13 equivalent grade based the recommendation of the supervisor. This recommendation will be based on performance and availability of funds.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this position is to enhance the M&E functional capacity of OTI country programs and the Program Office.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Program Manager must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role transition programming can play in the mitigation of conflict and the development of democracy.  Ideally, the Program Manager will have experience working on transition, fragile states, or post-conflict programs that are similar to those that OTI implements.  The Program Manager will also have experience in assessment, design, monitoring and evaluation of activities and programs implemented in the transitional environments in which OTI works.

The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work often involves evolving program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual must be someone who is highly flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. S/he must be able to work effectively and productively as a member of a team.

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

A.	GS-12 EQUIVALENT 

* Provide direct support to country teams' monitoring of ongoing OTI programs by improving existing systems of gathering project- and program-level rolling impact data or developing new systems if necessary. This includes Washington-based and field-based support to OTI and implementing partner staff.
* Develop processes to better incorporate program impact findings into current program implementation.
* Assist in the development, refinement, and presentation of the M&E portions of country program startup conferences, retreats, and other ongoing implementation trainings for OTI USPSC, FNPSC and partner staff, in collaboration with OTI training and technical staff.
* Assist in managing the OTI e-Room and other communication tools to facilitate exchange of Implementation and Impact information, results, best practices, and guidance between OTI Washington, OTI Field staff, and OTI Partner staff.

SELECTION FACTORS
(Determines basic eligibility for the position.  Applicants who do not meet all of the selection factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)
* Applicant is a U.S. Citizen;
* Complete and hand-signed federal form OF-612 submitted;
* Supplemental document specifically addressing the Evaluation Factors submitted;
* Ability to obtain a SECRET level security clearance;
* Satisfactory verification of academic credentials.

EVALUATION FACTORS
(Used to determine the competitive ranking of qualified applicants in comparison to other applicants.  The factors are listed in priority order from highest to least.)

Factor #1	Applicant must provide a response no longer than one page in length to the following questions for the country program example below:

i. What simple indicators and tools can be used for measuring program- and activity-level impacts in the below country program example?
ii. What tools may be applied towards developing an operational framework to guide program decision-making on the program objectives and taking periodic "snapshots" of important program components?

In July 2006, OTI launched a new program in Country X which will soon elect national leadership to replace an interim government following a decade of civil war.? This new initiative is part of the U.S. Government's effort to support Country X in a successful political transition and help consolidate peace after 10 years of civil war. The broad goals of the program are to reinforce Country X's conflict mitigation capacity, advance inclusiveness in the political process, and engage youth in constructive, non-violent activity. Over the next 24 months, the program will provide strategically targeted support to activities that help the new Government of X (GOX) gain traction and consolidate legitimacy as it undertakes the formidable challenges of national transformation. 

The program's main objectives are to: (1) improve capacity of key GOX ministries and offices in areas including effective planning, budgeting, communication and coordination with relevant counterparts; and (2) assist the GOX and other key actors to mount effective responses to high visibility issues that are linked to the peace and recovery process. The program will accomplish these objectives by providing: short-term technical assistance to priority GOX ministries and offices; small grant activities that will reinforce this technical assistance; assistance to civil society organizations and media outlets for public information campaigns; and other programming to promote the stability essential for a fragile state to stay on the path towards peace and recovery. 

OTI wants to assess the achievements and challenges of the program over the course of the next 24 months.  OTI also wants to enhance program management by improved decision-making processes for program strategy adjustments and assessing activity-level impact.  These efforts will help the program to prioritize initiatives, identify critical partners, and assess impact of activities, without impeding the rapid response and flexibility that is critical to OTI country programming.   


Factor #2	Demonstrated professional experience in the evaluation of project activities relevant to political transition and/or post-conflict programs.

Factor #3	Demonstrated oral and written communication skills, and analytical skills illustrated through the research, preparation and presentation of status reports, briefing papers, and other official documents.

Factor #4	Demonstrated social and interpersonal skills illustrated by the ability to interact in a team setting, or with counterparts, on both the lowest and highest political, social, and economic levels.

Factor #5	Demonstrated ability to initiate, develop and manage multiple projects simultaneously in a high visibility, high-pressure environment, including crisis situations.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 is hereby incorporated into Request for Quotation (RFQ) SP3100-07-T-0099.  Amendment 0002 is being issued to answer a vendors questions and extend the RFQ response date.

Question 1:  At the site visit we were told that the heating coils were removed when the tanks were switched from No. 6 oil to No. 4 oil, amendment one now states, "The heating coils remain inside the tanks." 

-	If the coils are in fact in the tank are they serpentine or bundled coils?  
-	If bundled coils what are the dimensions and how many are there? 
-	If serpentine how far apart are the coils? 

Please note, depending on the dimensions of the serpentine coils at least one of the tests (Magnetic flux leakage evaluation of tank bottom plates with ultransonic B Scan...) you are asking to be performed on the floor may not be done.

Answer 1:  The coils are serpentine.  The Government does not know how far apart the coils are.  Previous tests that were performed on the tanks were:  Ultrasonic B-Scan, Imaging, Vacuum Box Testing and Visual Inspection Techniques.

Question 2:  How far is the closest emergency service department capable of emergency rescue if confined space emergency?

Answer 2:  The fire station would be the emergency service rescue, less than 1 mile.

The RFQ response date is hereby extended from May 10, 2007 to May 14, 2007.

FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to this provision:

To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov. 

The Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, applies to this acquisition, per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses that have been incorporated by reference.  The applicable wage determination information is as follows:  Wage Determination No. 05-2455 REV (02) dated 11/22/2006 applies.
DLAD 52.233-9000-Agency protests (Sep 1999)
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
(End of provision)
DLAD 52.233-9001- Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
 (a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
( End of provision )

AMENDMENT 002 TO JOBSITE OFFICE TRAILERS AND CARGO TRAILER W81R8T-7088-0027 *CLOSING DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS REMAINS 19 JUNE 2007 11:00 AM MST* Questions and Answers about Jobsite Office Trailers solicitation: Q1:  We need to clarify the following items with respect to the (5) 8 1/2 x 28 trailers:    Q1A:  5 KW Generator - Are you looking for a portable style with gas                  tank mounted on generator or RV style with separate fuel system?    A1A:  RV style     Q1B:  Lab Bench - We need to know size.     A1B:  10 ft x 3 foot     Q1C:  Interior Height - What is your requirement for Interior Height?     A1C:  7' Q2:  Does the Office have to be attached to a chassis system? May it be free standing and movable with a tilt trailer and/ or fork lifts?  We believe that a 20 ISO Shipping Container may be of a better value to the government being made of 16 gauge steel and resistant to winds of up to 175 mph. A2:  It needs to be attached to the chassis system Q3:  A question from a furniture vendor:  Will you be purchasing furniture for the trailers? A3:  Not at this time Q4:  Is an ISO container (Office Conex) acceptable for the office trailers? A4: No, we need the ability to move them in very short notice without additional equipment Q5:  Per the RFQ delivery is required within 60 days after receipt of order; can the delivery requirement be considered to be moved to the right for a delivery timeline of 10 to 12 weeks from the receipt of order? The trailers can be delivered incrementall y as they are completed through that timeframe to the customer. Would this be acceptable?   A5: We need them as soon as possible. If needed we will take them as they are built.  12 week delivery ARO is acceptable but delivery of all units must be completed by that time. - end -
