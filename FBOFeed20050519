<DESC>This program addresses current shortfalls in information integration resulting from limitations in technology and uncertainty/imprecision of data and information. The Program seeks to develop hardware and software technologies that (1) identify and integrate informational content from multiple information sources; (2) integrate the massive amounts of information; and (3) provide automatic correlation, fusion, and insight to support user-cognitive processes. Particular emphasis will be placed on automating the association of objects and events in the battlespace and automatically transforming this information into actionable knowledge (e.g., indications and warnings of intent).  

In current and future operational environments such as Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), warfighters require technologies evolved to support information needs regardless of location and consistent with the user’s level of command or responsibility and operational situation. To support this need, the DOD has developed the concept of Network Centric Warfare (NCW). The Chief of Naval Research (CNO) defines NCW as “military operations that exploit state-of-the-art information and networking technology to integrate widely dispersed human decision makers, situational and targeting sensors, and forces and weapons into a highly adaptive, comprehensive system to achieve unprecedented mission effectiveness.” 

Net-centric operations include communications and information assurance capabilities to enable all-source data access, multi-source processing, and tailored dissemination to Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) users across the network. The operational benefits sought are an increased speed, accuracy and precision of command; distributed self-synchronization; flexibility and adaptability to an operational situation; and decision superiority. To accomplish this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.

<SUBJECT>R--Marine Corps Systems Command, Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) Open Season.
<SOLNBR>CEOSSOS06
<CONTACT>Mark Hoyland 703-432-3781
<DESC>RFI The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY06.  Both current vendors and new vendors will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the Command’s Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August 2002.   To date, $340+ million in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $150K to $6 million.  CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404(b), which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  Twenty-seven competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.  CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated Command requirements.  Additionally,  CEOss assesses the need for new prime ve! ndor awards in selected domains.  For FY06, openings are anticipated in the ES and ALA domains; unrestricted as to business size.  A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors during the week of 6 June 2005, to provide detailed information about specific submission requirements.  Vendors are required to register for this workshop by submitting an email to the ACSS mailbox (acss@usmc.mil) NLT 1 June 2005.  Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints.  CEOss Background Information:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.  Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.  There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering, Business and Analytical, Engineering and Scientific, and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative.  Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.  To qualify for consideration in the ES domain you must possess either a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or IT (70) schedule.  To qualify in the ALA domain, you must possess either a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or LOGWORLD (874V) schedule.  Although vendors may have a prime BPA award ! in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted. Instructions for new CEOss applicants:  To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors should submit the following information NLT 20 June 2005:   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages that identifies their firm’s capabilities within a domain of prime interest (ES or ALA);   a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule; and any general marketing information.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.  All business sizes will be considered for the ES and ALA domain openings. Vendor information will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firm’s pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.  Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 11 July 2005.  Responses will be due within fifteen (15) business days, inclusive of teaming arrangements.  Competitive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 22 August 2005.   Currently, there is no formal requirement and this is only a Request for Information (RFI).  RFI responses can be mailed to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134-5010.  Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester St., Attn: Cynthia Chandler, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. Instructions for existing CEOss Prime Vendors:  To reconstitute teaming relationships on your existing CEOss BPA, you are required to submit the following information:  An initial letter of intent, limited to two (2) pages, that identifies both current and planned team members, discusses your ability to meet prescribed competition thresholds, and provides a rationale for the new team to continue to support MCSC programs.  This must be submitted NLT 13 June 2005.  Revised proposals are due in accordance with the schedule on ACSS web site.  This must be accompanied by a copy of your selected team members GSA Schedule, and single, updated MS Excel spreadsheet of all of the GSA rates for your team from September 2005-September 2007 (including rates from existing GSA team schedules).  Do not submit this in .pdf format, it must be a single .xls file with one rate schedule per worksheet.  Existing BPAs will be bilaterally modified to update labor rates (Attachment C) and to incorpo! rate any additional terms and conditions.  Additional guidance will be issued to incumbent vendors at a later date. All responses from existing CEOss Prime Vendors shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:  acss@usmc.mil.  Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted electronically to the ACSS Office at acss@usmc.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Centerplate/NBSE, Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC 20001, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This request is for food and beverage services for approx. 400 people for a 2 day conference "Environmental Solutions to Obesity in Americas Youth", June 1-2, 2005, being held at the Washington Convention Center.  The Washington Convention Center has a designated service organization which supplies catering services for events held at its facility and will not permit outside entities to supply food and beverages for planned events.  As a consequence no other source has the ability to provide food and beverage services for the NIEHS conference.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing these catering services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 7 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 7 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Centerplate/NBSE.  The NAICS Code/Size is 722310/$17.5M..  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  Market research into convention center services for conferences similar in nature has shown that the practice of a convention center providing the catering services using a designated provider for events held at their facility is standard practice in the industry.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>The Air to ground Munitions Systems Wing (A-GMSW), A-G DASG Fuzes Program Office, is contemplating issuing a Sole Source Award to Kaman Dayron in Orlando FL.  This effort is to procure an additional 31,606 FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) systems along with additional spare parts components and 180 fuze trainers over the years FY06 through FY11.  The current contract awarded to Kaman-Dayron specifies maximum quantities allowable in priced production options.  The current FMU-152A/B acquisition strategy is to buy-to-budget to catch up with JDAM total production quantities.  This contract modification is meant to increase maximum allowable quantities under each of the remaining production options with the first additional quantities delivered with the production option starting in October 2006.  The estimated cost of this additional procurement is approximately $65M.  The FMU-152A/B JPF is a cockpit-selectable bomb fuze employed in MK-80 series warheads (both guided and unguided variations), and both the 2000lb and 5000lb series Penetrator warheads.  The FMU-152A/B fuze system consists of the fuze, the FZU-55A/B fuze initiator, a closure ring, and power cable.  Spares for the fuze system would consist of the FZU-55A/B initiator, power cable, closure ring, compatibility hardware for GBU-15/AGM-130 configuration, and a small variety of sub-tier components.  In addition to the required spares, the government requires additional procurement of JPF trainers in the following configurations: 1.  The FMU-152A(D-1)/B configuration consists of  a non-explosive fuze with working electronics and the closure ring used for laboratory and pilot familiarization and proficiency training and 2.

(a). Prohibitions.
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.
(b). Definitions.   As used in this clause.
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a “Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1).  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct of indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2).  After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i).  In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii). In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3).  The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.   
(c.) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1). Certain Stock Disregarded.  For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i). Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii.) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.
(2) Plan Deemed in Certain Cases.  If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.  The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.  For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1). Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i). Warrants;
(ii). Options;
(iii). Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv). Convertible debt instruments; and
(v). Others similar interests.
(2). Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure.
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that its not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<CONTACT>Major Richard Hollen (703) 432-3568 richard.hollen@usmc.mil
<DESC>On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) this notice announces a forthcoming  procurement for the Rifle Combat Optic II (RCO II) for the M16A4 and M16A2 service rifles and the M4 carbine. The Government intends to award at least one contract for the RCO II.  The Government anticipates issuing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract (DPAS rated DO-A5) to the successful offeror or offerors representing the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award prior to 15 August 05. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.  All future information relative to this procurement will be available to industry through the FedBizOpps and NECO websites. Offerors shall submit separate technical and business proposals along with (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the RCO II.  The ! Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  MINIMUM / MAXIMUM PURCHASES: The minimum purchase for the RCO II is 100,000 units.  The maximum purchase for the RCO II is 500,000 units.  This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award.   EVALUATION: In making its final “best value” determination, the Government will consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of descending importance (from most to least important):  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Integrated Logistics Support, and (3) Past Performance.  (For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated. Offerors should read the terms and conditions of this solicitation carefully and refer any questions to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the col! lection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) ! record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additiona! l read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restrictio! n on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18 Availability of Funds, 52.247-34 F.o.B. Destination. DFARS clauses: 252.211-7003, 252.204-7004, 252.212-7001, and 252.225-7000.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the col! lection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) ! record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additiona! l read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restricti! on on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18 Availability of Funds, 52.247-34 F.o.B. Destination. DFARS clauses: 252.211-7003, 252.204-7004, 252.212-7001, and 252.225-7000.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Weapons and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) (PMA263) is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals for research support in developing innovative solutions for the Maritime and Littoral Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  Concepts developed under this BAA may be considered in the development of future unmanned ISR systems and system improvements.  The Navy’s desire is to develop ISR mission system enhancements for implementation in the 2013 timeframe, concurrent with other planned ISR improvements.   The U.S. Navy is in the process of recapitalizing its land-based maritime ISR capabilities, currently provided by the aging P-3 and EP-3 aircraft.  The Navy believes that the integration of manned and unmanned systems enables the creation of an overarching maritime architecture that can effectively enhance ISR mission performance and result in improved cost and mission effectiveness.  The manned portion of the Navy’s Family of Systems (FoS) with Broad Area Maritime ISR capabilities that will replace the P-3 and EP-3 are the Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA/P-8A) and the Aerial Common Sensor (ACS) aircraft.  The unmanned portion is the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance System (BAMS), the VTUAV (Fire Scout), and the Tactical Control System (TCS).  The desired outcome of this study is a capability based definition and overarching systems architecture that will support the development of the unmanned portion of the FoS for maritime ISR.    
The complete Broad Agency Announcement and all associated documentation will be listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil  (choose “Doing Business” from the left side of the page; select “Open Solicitations”; select N00019-05-R-0071).  All associated documentation (Government Furnished Information, DD254, etc) will also be posted at the above website.  Submit any questions in writing to jessica.blackwell@navy.mil.  Questions and answers will be posted at the above web site.  All updates to the BAA will be posted to the above web site.  It is highly recommended that interested offerors continually check the web site.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and previously found in solicitations. According to the language included in FAR Case 2001-026, vendors are required to use ORCA beginning 1 January 2005.  Detailed information ! can be found in the FAR Case, as well as by visiting the Help section of the website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.

Extended warranties and 24/48 hour exchange agreements are also being procured for these items as ap! propriate.  These components will be used in the MK 650 Test Set.  The software developed by NSWC PC for this test set is highly specific to the VXI modular instrumentation cards manufactured by VXI Technology, Inc.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  To purchase modular instrumentation cards from any other manufacturer would require re-writing all of the MK 650 Test Set software.  The software design and development stages have required many months, and re-writing it would be a major cost.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT , NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. Uri Tasch, 5 Ruby Field Ct., Baltimore, Maryland 21209,  to design and construct a gait for non-human primates.  Dr. Tasch, will provide all labor, materials, equipment, and facilities to perform or have performed through a subcontractor the construction and design of a gait apparatus for NIA’s project titled“Assessment of Primate Aging:  Effects of Caloric Modification a longitudinal study which began in 1987.   A durable platform about 6 foot in length and 2 feet in width will be hung between two standard rhesus cages.  The platform will be constructed of a stainless steel mesh tunnel, about 2 feet high, that will be removable and portable.  The platform will contain a load cells used to determine the gait of an animal as the animal walks through the tunnel.  The apparatus and load cell will be capable of being placed in the cage washing unit without damaging the apparatus. A separate unit containing the load cells will be able to be disassembled from the main apparatus and disinfected separately.  In addition, the load cell component will be constructed in such a way that the plastic covering can be placed over it to protect it from any liquid and other contamination while it is in use.  The apparatus will have a load cells in order to detect movement which will be interpreted by computer software.  The computer software will generate estimates of gait parameters, such as speed, stride length, force of limb placement and efficiency of locomotion.  The apparatus must be constructed so that it can be tilted 60 degrees to the horizontal using a hand crank system.  The load cells will need to be design in a Plexiglas case in order to protect the electronics from any kind of liquids.  The contractor shall deliver a    prototype of the proposed apparatus by July 29, 2005.  The modified of prototype apparatus for field testing, shall be delivered by September 30, 2005, and the final version of the apparatus shall be delivered by  December 30, 2005.  All work shall be performed in a professionalmanner and meet or exceed government standards.  The apparatus will be reviewed and approved by the Principle Investigator,  the facility Veterinarian,  and the Facility Supervisor.   The government will provide the caging necessary to link the six (6) foot platform in-between as well as the computer equipment to run the software designed to collect gait from the animals involved in the study.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise of Dr. Tasch, in the design and construction of this type of unit.  Dr. Tasch has developed a similar apparatus for examining gait in bovine and equine applications that is now in commercial use. Dr. Tasch’s laboratory has all the necessary tools and machines to construct the apparatus. In addition, he has the expertise in modifying the software necessary to make the apparatus operational. Geographic proximity to the project is another factor. Dr. Tasch, must make frequent visits to the site to assemble the equipment and make adjustments to it during the early pilot testing to assure its proper function.  Therefore it is to the Government’s best interest to continue with Dr. Tasch, on the design and construction of the Gait for non- human primates.  An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Tasch’s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332618, and Size Standard is 500employees for this requirement. This is a set-aside requirement. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.  It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes; 1) The ability to oversee and approve of physical construction of the requested apparatus. 2) The ability to integrate load cell technology within the apparatus. 3) The ability to write software for analyzing multiple parameters of gait. 4) The ability to trouble shoot problems with apparatus and software. The statement of interest must propose a methodology of assuring the achievement of timely and acceptable performance of the work and at least three (3) reference of documenting past performance experiences and completion of the project.  The submission will be evaluated on the Offeror’s documented knowledge, skills abilities and experiences as reflected in the statement of interest, and past performance. The statement of interest must be submitted on or before May 31, 2005 12:00 noon.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments  to this announcement, referencing synopsis number  NHLBI-PS-2005-089-DDC, may be submitted in writing to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.    Fax responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<SOLNBR>R1058
<CONTACT>Marcia Stowers Marcia.Stowers@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The purpose of this RFI is to make known to private industry the governments desire to potentially replace the functionality of a planning and scheduling software product called Jaguar/JAGCOTs by Robbins-Gioia (R-G).  Jaguar is referred to as JAGCOTs when referencing the integration of Ilog and Rogue Wave software products in conjunction with Jaguar, which provide the Web, based infrastructure services required by the Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS). The government is seeking assistance from private industry in identifying any potential commercially available software product(s) in-whole or in-combination that could replace the Jaguar/JAGCOTs software utilized by PDMSS as well as provide associated cost data, to include cost to convert current applications and associated data, cost to license COTs software, cost for yearly maintenance of COTs and associated software and the cost to maintain converted applications and data.  Private industry can reference the list of functional requirements from the PDMSS (G097) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to assist in this identification process.  Table of PDMSS Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is attached in separate document to this synopsis.  At a minimum, any potential replacement software product has to support fully all of the SRS functional requirements listed in the table.  No exceptions will be made by the government with regard to this requirement. The JAGCOTs software product is used in an Air Force Materiel Command system called PDMSS (G097) in combination with two other commercial off the shelf products by Ilog and Rogue Wave.  PDMSS itself is a web-based system that is responsible for the planning, tracking, scheduling and performance measurement activities for depot maintenance overhaul/rebuild for aircraft and missile systems.  Major pieces of functionality include Projects, Master Operations, Selected Operations, Networks, and Routed Items and Definitized Guides.  Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (ALC), Oklahoma City ALC, and Ogden ALC operate PDMSS. Only interested/capable potential offerors need respond.  Responses are requested back to the Government thirty (30) days after release of public RFI.  Questions and/or clarifications will be discussed between the Contracting Officer and Focal Point. Responses to RFI shall be no more than twenty (20) pages; Font will be Times New Roman, 12-point font size, with 1” margins.  Cover page and any supplemental materials/attachments are not included in the page limitation. The Government will not release any code or request any demos at this time in conjunction with the RFI; therefore, a non-disclosure agreement is not necessary. Contractors or individuals responding to this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Synopsis shall submit their responses via e-mail to: Marcia.Stowers@wpafb.af.mil by 4:00 PM, on 18 June 2005.

<DESC>The expected result of this project is to mechanically alter fuel loadings on approximately 411 acres within pre-commercially thinned stands located on the Wallowa Valley Ranger District. The stands consist primarily of lodgepole and ponderosa pine species. The tree spacing ranges between 10 to 12 feet. Material to be treated is composed of pre-commerical thinning slash created between the years of 1997 to 2003. Trees thinned ranged in size from 18 inches tall up to the maximum cut DBH of 6 inches. Fuel amounts vary but are estimated at 0 to 2 feet in depth for a total of 5-10 tons/acre. This material is identified as fuel model 11 as defined by the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report, PNW-52 1976.  Treatment units are located on all aspects and located between 4200 feet and 5000 feet elevation. Treatment unit slope varies from 0 to 30% with an approximate average of 15%.

CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 2, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

BACKGROUND

SEVERAL ONGOING HHS AND GOVERNMENT-WIDE INITIATIVES OF UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND SCOPE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING UNPARALLELED IMPACT UPON ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HHS.  INSTALLATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM - UNIFORMED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (UFMS),  SHARED SERVICES PLANNING, BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS AND A-76 ACTIVITY HAVE CREATED CRITICAL DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL SKILLED PROFESSIONAL MANPOWER THAT IS TEMPORARY AND FLEXIBLE, BUT EXPECTED TO BE ONGOING.  IN ADDITION TO THE NEW TASKS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT UFMS, MANY EXISTING EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO THE PROJECT, AND BACKUP SUPPORT IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN EXISTING FUNCTIONS.  DUE TO INCREMENTALLY EMERGING EFFICIENCIES, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, QUANTITIES AND CONFIGURATION OF MANPOWER REQUIRED AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD OF TRANSITION IS AS YET, UNKNOWN

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED: 
        
TECHNICAL, PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORY ASSISTANCE AND PREPARATION OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE DEPARTMENT, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER (PSC), AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FMS) MANAGEMENT INCENTIVES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO UFMS, BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS, SHARED SERVICES PLANNING, A-76 AND RELATED MANPOWER PLANNING.  THE AGENCY INCENTIVES INVOLVED ARE ONGOING INTERRELATED ACTIVITIES THAT WILL REQUIRE INCREMENTAL INPUT AND REVISIONS RESULTING IN MAJOR CHANGES IN AGENCY ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES.  CONTRACTOR INPUT WILL CONSIST OF TECHNICAL ADVICE RENDERED IN AGENCY PLANNING SESSIONS, DATA GATHERING, PREPARATION OF VARIOUS DOCUMENTS AS THEY ARE NEEDED, AND PLANNING  LOGISTIC AND CONTRACT SUPPORT  TO IMPLEMENT PLANS AS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE.  THE WORK REQUIRES EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN ALL BASIC GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMMUNICATIONS, PROGRAM EVALUATION, ORGANIZATION PLANNING, EXPERT WRITING SKILLS IN ALL MEDIA, HUMAN RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT FINANCE, AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACT MANAGEMENT.  THE WORK ALSO REQUIRES EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE WITH HHS AND FMS, FINANCIAL OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION. 


* TASKS:
        
1.  MANPOWER PLANNING, MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND PREPARATION OF DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND MANAGE HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS IN FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, AND SYSTEMS TO COMPLEMENT ONGOING CHANGES.  THIS WILL ALSO INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT AND
MAINTENANCE OF AN ACCOUNTING INTERN PROGRAM DESIGNED TO FIT THE CHANGING
ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES.

2.  PLANNING, MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND PREPARATION OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS FOR FLEXIBLE CONTRACT ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS SUCH AS PREPARATION OF AUDITABLE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RECONCILIATIONS, DOCUMENTING OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, ETC.   

3.  PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING FMS PROFESSIONAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT TRAINING THAT WILL COMPLIMENT BUSINESS PLANS AS THEY EMERGE UNDER NEW ORGANIZATION AND PROCESS CONFIGURATIONS.  

4.  PARTICIPATION IN HHS AND FMS PLANNING GROUPS AND CREATION OF MISCELLANEOUS
PLANNING DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT COMPLEX ONGOING ORGANIZATIONAL AND
PROCESS CHANGES REQUIRED BY UFMS, SHARED SERVICES, AND CHANGES IN BUSINESS
PROCESSES.  

5.  TECHNICAL ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE ON SPECIFIC FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND SERVICES 
ACTIVITIES AS REQUESTED BY THE PROJECT OFFICER.

6.  FINANCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION AS REQUIRED, INCLUDING 
ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION AND RESPONSE TO OMB A-123 REQUIREMENTS..  

LOCATION OF SERVICES:  PARKLAWN COMPLEX IN ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND , CONTRACTOR SITE OR OFF-SITE LOCATIONS DEPENDENT UPON NATURE OF SPECIFIC SERVICES AS APPROVED BY PROJECT OFFICER.    

PROJECTED WORK SCHEDULE:  ESTIMATED TWENTY-FOUR TO THIRTY HOURS PER WEEK.  WEEKLY SCHEDULE MAY BE INCREASED BASED ON WORK REQUIREMENTS, AS APPROVED BY PROJECT OFFICER.        

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

THE REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROVIDE CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR SEVERAL ONGOING, HIGHLY COMPLEX, DEPARTMENT AND AGENCY INITIATIVES THAT ARE BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY EXPECTED TO RESULT IN MAJOR ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES IN DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL SERVICES. THESE INCLUDE SHARED SERVICES, UFMS, A-76 AND BUSINESS PROCESS DEVELOPMENT.  THE CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN A PRINCIPAL IN ALL THESE ONGOING ACTIVITIES.  THESE ARE ONGOING, AND URGENCY IS CREATED BY THE NEED FOR CONTINUITY AND TIMELINESS IN MANAGEMENT RESPONSES TO THE DEPARTMENT, AUDITS AND OMB.  

URGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY INTRODUCED ON OTHER PROJECTS COVERED DUE TO AUDIT AND MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED OR PREDICTABLE BY THE PERFORMING AGENCY.

THE CONTRACTOR SERVED ON A DEPARTMENT WORKGROUP AND WAS THE PRINCIPAL PROGRAM DATA COORDINATOR IN FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR SHARED SERVICES PLANNING, BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS AND FOR THE ONLY TWO A-76 COMPETITIONS THUS FAR CARRIED OUT IN THE PSC DIVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES - ALL CONTINUING ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HAVE ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE AGENCY.  

IN ADDITION, THE CONTRACTOR SERVED AS THE PRINCIPAL PSC FINANCIAL SERVICES MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR PLANNING TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF SERVICES IN THE EVENT OF DISASTER SITUATIONS.  IN ORGANIZATION, HE HAS CONCEIVED AND WRITTEN VIRTUALLY ALL KEY ORGANIZATION AND POSITION DESCRIPTIONS IN FINANCIAL OPERATIONS, AND HAS DEFINED, IMPLEMENTED AND MANAGED MOST ONGOING CONTRACT ASSISTANCE PROJECTS FOR THE DIVISION.  HE HAS PERSONALLY PLANNED AND INITIATED A NUMBER OF HIGH VISIBILITY FUNCTIONS SUCH AS IN DEBT MANAGEMENT, PROMPT PAYMENT, AND THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT FOR HIS MEDICAL SERVICES.  THESE ACTIVITIES AND MANY OTHERS HAVE REQUIRED AN INTIMATE, DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED BY THE PSC TO MULTIPLE CUSTOMER AGENCIES.  THE CONTRACTOR ALSO HAS UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE OF MOST PROGRAMS MANAGED BY PSC CUSTOMER AGENCIES FOR WHICH THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICE, PSC, PROVIDES FINANCIAL SERVICES.   

KEY DEPARTMENT AND PSC INITIATIVES ON WHICH THE CONTRACTOR HAS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE, ARE INTERRELATED AND CONTINUING, HOWEVER, MANY ARE SHORT TERM, MAKING IT DESIRABLE TO HIRE A KNOWLEDGEABLE, EXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO TRAIN AN EMPLOYEE OR EVEN AN INEXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR. ADDITIONS AND CHANGES WILL BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE STAGES AS PLANNING CONTINUES AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS REQUIRED IN THE PAST WILL BE EVEN MORE CRITICAL AS THESE ACTIVITIES CONTINUE, PERHAPS ON A MORE INTENSIVE BASIS.       

THE CONTRACTOR HAS EXTENSIVE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING AND MANAGING GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. HE ALSO HAS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE GAINED IN WELL OVER 20 YEARS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE PSC/HHS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPLICATE.  

THE CONTRACTOR HAS A UNIQUE AND IRREPLACEABLE COMBINATION OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE (INCLUDING DIRECT WORKING EXPERIENCE WITH THE ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES WHERE THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED) THAT ARE NEEDED FOR SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE.   

IN ADDITION, THE COST AND TIME REQUIRED TO EMPLOY AND TRAIN A DIFFERENT CONTRACTOR WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE, EVEN IF ONE WITH SIMILAR PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS COULD BE LOCATED.  

THE CONTRACTOR'S KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN OPERATIONS, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGING PSC FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE THEY ARE PROGRAM SPECIFIC AND ALSO BECAUSE HE HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL ROLE IN DEFINING THEIR PRESENT FORM.     ACCORDINGLY, IT IS BY FAR TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT, USING EITHER COST MEASURES OR THE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS, TO SELECT THE CONTRACTOR AS THE SOLE PROVIDER FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to issue a bridge contract to the Unisys Corporation for continued Information Technology Managed Services (ITMS) support on an other than full and open basis.  TSA’s ITMS program encompasses a full range of information technology services required to meet TSA’s responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders including Seat Managed Services (Desktops, Laptops, Peripherals, Voice, etc.), Program Operations/Infrastructure Management (Data Center, Help Desk, E-mail, Security, Connectivity, Engineering, etc.), Application Integration (Hosting, Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning), Engineering Support (Infrastructure, Operations, Software, Security), and Project Development/Deployment Support (Design, Test, Deploy, Monitor and Acceptance).
In August 2002, TSA competitively awarded a single managed services contract action to establish an information system and telecommunications infrastructure to house and transport TSA’s broad range of mission-critical applications.  IT managed services are currently provided through a task order on the GSA-administered Information Technology Omnibus Procurement (ITOP II) Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC) to Unisys.  The base period of the current ITMS contract will expire in August 2005, and it will not be possible to exercise the contract’s two (2) additional two-year option periods within the contract ceiling.  A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiative to consolidate all of the Department’s and bureaus’ IT requirements is anticipated to go into effect in the next two to three years.  During the performance of this bridge, TSA intends to transition to that contract when possible.  Therefore, this bridge contract will be a “bridge” to the DHS contract to ensure that there is no lapse in service awaiting DHS’s contract.  Furthermore, TSA plans on breaking out “non-core” services and competitively awarding contracts to multiple vendors, including small businesses, to infuse competition into the process.  These non-core requirements will include new IT equipment purchases, wireless communication services, application development, and program management services.  Information regarding these procurements will be announced in Federal Business Opportunities separately.

TSA plans on issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Unisys Corporation on or around June 1, 2005 with award no later than August 11, 2005.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with the TSA’s Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS) in lieu of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The period of performance of the contemplated contract will be a one-year base period with two one-year periods.  Information regarding the Department’s solution will be issued under a separate Federal Business Opportunities notice.

Inquiries on potential subcontracting opportunities should be directed to:  Unisys Corporation, Subcontracts Director, 8008 West Park Drive, McLean, VA  22102-3106, (703) 419-3125.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure 100K arrays, Mendel 500K arrays and various reagents from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  One of the projects currently going on in the GEB is the Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies, which was initiated in 1995 with the overall goal of discovering major susceptibility genes for esophageal cancer and identifying the genetic changes associated with the development of upper gastrointestinal cancers.  Finding such genes and molecular changes will help identify persons at particular high risk and target them for prevention strategies.   Previously DCEG has performed genome-wide mapping for this study using the 10K (10,000 SNP) mapping arrays.  Now DCEG proposes to use the newer Affymetrix 100K (100,000 SNP) and 500K (500,000 SNP) arrays which are considerably denser (by factors of 10- and 50-fold) to accomplish this important project.  The analysis will be performed at the NCI, Advanced Technology Center (ATC) using the ATC’s Government owned Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner and Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidic Station.  These are the only known arrays that have a high density genome-wide mapping capacity at the 500K level that are compatible with the existing Government owned Affymetrix equipment and will be used in continuation of ongoing experiments.  It is critical that new variables not be introduced into these on-going protocols by changing platforms.  Affymetrix is the only known source to the NCI Researcher that can meet the aforementioned requirement.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on May 25, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted. NAICS: 325413; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>Because the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis does not produce private sector GDP for firm size categories, the Office of Advocacy over the years has contracted with researchers to calculate small businesses’ current share of private sector GDP.  For a compendium of such research, please see http://www.sba.gov/advo/research.   The Office of Advocacy is interested in updating the figures and seeing if the relative share of small business output in the U.S. economy has changed.  Note that figures should use Advocacy’s research definition of a small business, which is a firm (or the entirety of all establishments or business locations in the U.S.) with fewer then 500 employees, and the final result should include single person operations (or nonemployer businesses). Previous research has created annual estimates over time by industry.  Proposals are expected to create estimates for at least the last ten years, with older data also adding to the value of the final product. Questions and answers for this procurement shall comence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>Retaining qualified employees continues to be challenging for small businesses. The sixth edition of the Small Business Problems and Priorities published by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) identified employee turnover as one of the problems that small businesses continue to encounter (http://www.nfib.com/object/IO_16191.html). The NFIB study found that keeping skilled employees is of more importance to small businesses in the construction and retail trade industries.  In a previous study funded by the Office of Advocacy, half of all small firms with one to one hundred employees were seeking employees, two-thirds reported trouble hiring (see Labor Shortages, Needs and Related Issues in Small and Large Businesses by Joel Popkin and Company (Part A http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs195atot.pdf, Part B http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs195btot.pdf). The study also found that half of the companies looking to hire someone eventually hired someone less qualified than they were looking for.Advocacy is seeking research to understand the impact of employee compensation on small businesses and how small firms can lower the employee turnover rate. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to procure the services of a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program (Ticket Program) Operations Support Manager (OSM) contractor to meet the objectives set forth in the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA), Public Law 106-170 and in the Social Security Act, Section 1148.  Specifically, the Ticket Program OSM will oversee and support processes necessary to sustain ongoing Ticket Program operations and facilitate access of Ticket-eligible beneficiaries to Employment Networks (EN) by:  (1) establishing and maintaining a toll-free telephone call center and electronic mail response capability to answer beneficiary questions and making referrals, as appropriate (2) administering and supporting the Ticket assignment process; and (3) administering and supporting the EN payment process.

On Sep 29, 2000, SSA awarded a 5-year contract to a single Program Manager (PM) to assist in administering the Ticket Program by providing a wide variety of services in 3 main areas: EN recruitment, operations support, and systems access and support.  To meet Ticket Program support requirements following expiration of the current PM contract on Sep 28, 2005, SSA will award 2 Ticket Program contracts:  OSM and Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO).  SSA anticipates contract award on Aug 1, 2005.  The OSM contractor must be fully operational and be prepared to assume all the duties and responsibilities required by this solicitation by Sep 29, 2005.  (NOTE:  SSA will provide the necessary system access and support directly and/or through a systems support contractor.)  The services to be procured affiliated with this Presolicitation Notice and anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) Number SSA-RFP-05-1047 are for the services of a Ticket Program OSM.  Anticipated services to be procured for the Ticket Program PMRO are affiliated with RFP Number SSA-RFP-06-1006.  

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  On Dec 17, 1999, the President signed the TWWIIA establishing the Ticket Program (see http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10061.html for additional information).  This legislation establishes in the SSA the Ticket Program to provide Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities more choices for receiving employment services and increases provider incentives to serve beneficiaries with disabilities who want to work.  Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits are designed to provide a basic level of support for individuals with disabilities whose earning abilities are restricted due to their impairments.  TWWIIA Public Law 106-170 addresses a number of barriers that advocates believe disability beneficiaries encounter in obtaining jobs and continuing to work by expanding the availability of health care services and coverage, eliminating certain work disincentives, providing for enhanced benefits planning and assistance from other public and private sources and creating the Ticket Program. 

Under the Ticket program, SSA is directed to provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services, employment services, and/or other support services from an EN of their choice and to establish agreements with ENs to provide such services.  The Ticket Program was implemented nationally in 3 phases beginning Feb 2002 through Sep 2004 and Tickets were mailed to more than 10 million eligible beneficiaries with disabilities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.  In addition, Tickets are mailed to between 80,000 and 85,000 new beneficiaries each month upon entering the disability rolls. 

SSA anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement type contract with a 5-year period of performance.  The estimated date for the issuance of the RFP on www.fedbizopps.com  is Jun 3, 2005 with proposal responses due 30 calendar days thereafter (est. Jul 3, 2005).  The solicitation and any amendments will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.  Paper copies of the RFP and affiliate documents will not be mailed.  No telephone requests will be honored. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

The PMRO will be responsible for performing outreach activities to encourage and facilitate beneficiary participation in the Ticket Program and to recruit service providers to serve those beneficiaries as Employment Networks (ENs).  Specifically, the PMRO will provide the following services:  (1) Recruit ENs: The PMRO shall recruit and recommend potential ENs for selection by SSA and develop recruitment strategies to ensure that adequate choices of services are available to all SSA Ticket eligible beneficiaries; (2) Ensure Availability of Adequate Services: The PMRO shall develop and execute EN recruitment strategies to ensure that employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services, and other support services are available to all SSA Ticket eligible beneficiaries, including beneficiaries residing in rural areas; (3) Ensure Reasonable Access to Services: The PMRO shall develop and execute EN recruitment strategies to ensure that SSA Ticket-eligible beneficiaries requesting employment services, VR services, and other support services have reasonable access to those services; (4) Encourage Participation in the Ticket Program by Eligible SSA Beneficiaries: The PMRO, in accordance with the Social Security Ticket to Work Strategic Marketing Plan, shall develop and execute strategies to ensure maximum Ticket Program outreach to eligible SSA beneficiaries; and (5) Facilitate Beneficiary Access to ENs: The PMRO shall assist SSA in developing and executing strategies to facilitate access by SSA Ticket-eligible beneficiaries to ENs capable and willing to serve them.

The Ticket Program was implemented      nationally in 3 phases beginning Feb 2002 through Sep 2004, and Tickets were mailed to more than 10 million eligible beneficiaries with disabilities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. In addition, Tickets are mailed to between 80,000 and 85,000 new beneficiaries each month upon entering the disability rolls. 

SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement type contract with a 5-year period of performance.  The estimated date for the issuance of the RFP on www.fedbizopps.com  is Jun 3, 2005, with proposal responses due 30 calendar days thereafter (est. Jul 3, 2005).  This acquisition is subject to the availability of Fiscal Year 2006 funds.  An October 1, 2005, award date is anticipated.  The solicitation and any amendments will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.  Paper copies of the RFP and affiliate documents will not be mailed.  No telephone requests will be honored. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

In January 2001, Public Debt advertised in FedBizOpps our intent to issue a solicitation for a Digital Telephone Recording System for our Washington DC Office.  Under competitive procurement procedures, Sound Communications Inc was awarded the contract on purchase order number TPDPD-01-E-01520.  Sound Communications has previously installed and currently maintains the equipment at our Parkersburg, WV facility and our Washington DC facility.  It is imperative that the equipment being installed at the Washington DC location be compatible with the equipment currently installed and in operation.  The Government intends to solicit only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.    A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 p.m. EDT, June 3, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement at terms more advantageous to the Government.   If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole-source award to Sound Communications Inc.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Please find attached responses to vendor questions as of May 19, 2005. No further questions shall be answered.  1.  Submitted Question:  Will alternate proposals be evaluated or is only one proposal per company/team allowed? Response:  Alternate proposals may be considered as long as they are clearly identified as such when submitting the primary proposal. There is no limitation on number of proposal submitted. 2.  Submitted Question:  Question/Answer #37 says "This was only a sample"; however, isn't this what we are providing resumes for? Why are companies scrambling to find resumes for requirements that are not even required, but only a samples? Response:  A sample resume is a composite of typical skills offered by the vendor OR a sample of an actual resume of an individual that possesses skills to meet the requirements of the statement of work.  If a company is struggling to find such skills, it is questionable whether or not such a source would be able to meet the solicitation requirements. 3.  Submitted Question:  Question/Answer #38 says the Web Applicatiopn Development section has been removed; however, the SOW still has this section in it. When will an updated SOW be released ? Response:  The amendment has corrected this by description and is an acceptable practice.  There is no requirement to issue replacement pages for the SOW in amendments unless changes are extensive.  The Government may issue a finalized version before award. 4.  Submitted Question:  Question/Answer #44 did not answer the question that was asked. Can new labor categories be added later inf they are within the original scope of the contract and SBA's limitations ? Response:  The question was answered.  The adding of any new labor categories is dependent upon (1) the scope of the contract, (2) the Government's need to add these and (3) the willingness of SBA to allow this.  Factors considered are the amount of the change, impact on contract performance time and a determination as to the requirement fitting the scope. 5.  Submitted Question:  23.Submitted Question:  Section F refers to Place of Performance as being NBC's Denver office or one of many NBC offices or client sites.  If all work will be performed within NBC or client offices, why is the following required of the contractor?  The solicitation never mentions these systems to be accessed from the vendor's facilities   Self Assessment NIST SP800-26 on all MAs & GSSs? Vulnerability Analysis Systems scanned monthly with a tool compatible with the software in use by the OCIO.   What software tool is the OCIO using for DOI vulnerability analysis? Penetration Testing: Of all high risk systems accessible from the internet Security Controls: Contractors are to comply with NIST SP800-53 or FIPS 200.  Solicitations are to include the complete publication or a reference to it. Contingency Plan:  Contractors are to submit a plan in accordance with NIST SP800-34 or a reference to it Response:  Self Assessment, Vulnerability Analysis and Contingency Plan section has been removed in Amendment 0005. 6.  Submitted Question:  Where can I access a copy of this DOI memo from Hord Tipton 8/04? It just reads like these tests are to be completed by the contractor and referenced in the solicitation (proposal). Response:  Since these tests are not required, providing this memo is unnecessary.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) seeks expression of interest regarding DSCC’s desire to establish a Government supply contract for various “kitting” projects.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) definition of kitting is “two or more assorted items issued as a single item of supply”.  The kit will have a Bill of Material and be used for a specific purpose. A kit will also consist of government approved components assembled in government approved packaging to be supplied to a storage depot or directly to the customer.
 
Delivery destinations would include Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) depots and direct vendor delivery locations for Military bases located in the United States and worldwide.

This prospective initiative will encompass multiple NSNs of various types, with a potential to add items over the life of the contract(s).   This initiative anticipates a Request for Proposal (RFP), utilizing Best Value Source Selection criteria to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract(s).  Multiple awards are possible.  The type of contract contemplated for this program is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FP w/EPA) Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with one or more option periods of one or more years.   Standard long term contracts at DSCC are for a one year base period with four (4) one year options for a total contract length of five (5) years.  Suggestions for other long term arrangements will be considered.

The Government seeks information on vendors’ capabilities and ideas for providing supply support.  Depending upon the nature of the responses to this request, the Government will determine such things as acquisition strategy, source selection criteria, production lead times and economic order quantities.  Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include surge and wartime readiness sustainment requirements.  We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce.

Topics that vendors may wish to comment on include, but are not limited to:

•	The overall feasibility and cost effectiveness of such an initiative
•	Any Economic order quantities that lend themselves to price breaks
•	Recommendations for use of existing Government furnished material

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey to locate Small Business, Veteran Owned, SUBZone and 8(a) firms under NACIS Code 541611 ($6 M) capable of  providing all technical expert support to facilitate strategic planning efforts for the Training Branch of the Division of Research, Training and Education, Material and Child Health Bureau.  The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) is to provide national leadership and to work in partnership with States, communities, public-private partners, and families to strengthen the maternal and child health (MCH) infrastructure, assure the availability and use of medical homes, and build the knowledge and human resources, in order to assure continued improvement in health, safety and well-being of the MCH population.  In particular, the Training Branch within MCHB, HRSA is responsible in part for assuring the building of knowledge and human resources to improve the health of children through training and education of the next generation of MCH public health leaders. Much more just than a mechanism to support the education of individuals, the Training Program is designed to be a vehicle for national MCH infrastructure building.  Training Program grantees are key partners with the Federal government and the States in improving the health of women and children through their work with professional associations, public agencies, and voluntary organizations; moreover, they constitute a ready and willing cadre of individuals with expertise, dedication and commitment to children.  In spring 2004, the Training Branch completed a five-year strategic plan entitled “National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training.”  This National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training, 2005-2010, is available at www.mchb.hrsa/gov/training/ which established measurable targets for MCH training in the next five years.  In order to implement this strategic plan, the MCH Training Branch staff must actively work together with a variety of partners to achieve the strategic objectives.  Several activities outlined in the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training require the assessment of the MCH workforce, the convening of work groups and content experts, and the development and refinement of MCH training performance measures. The scope of work requires convening various groups to develop work plans	necessary to achieve the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training objectives which requires:  (1) Analyzing performance measures and establishing baseline data indicators necessary to achieve the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training objectives, (2) Data analysis and management information activities such as establishing baseline indicators, analyzing performance indicators, and monitoring the progress and impact of the MCH Training Strategic Plan. (3) Provide MCH Training program coordination activities such as preparation for site visits, supporting innovative collaborations to reach areas not currently served through the MCH Training Program and substantive assistance with the sharing of training materials  and (4) Strategic partnership development such as identifying and tracking key national organizations with an interest in MCH training, monitoring activities of the Federal Interagency committee on MCH Training, and assessing the interests of foundations in the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training activities
Critical task involve: Data Analysis and Management Information Activities. The contractor shall assist Federal program staff in analyzing performance indicators and grantee progress reports.  In particular, the contractor shall review the current performance indicators with experts in the content areas and make recommendations to Federal staff regarding their utility (in particular, do they need to be better specified?  Can they be improved?  Are key performance indicators missing?).  The contractor shall also review progress reports for qualitative information deemed helpful in describing the impact of the MCH Training Program.  The contractor shall develop a comprehensive, annual report and PowerPoint presentation based on analysis of information from performance indicators and progress reports. The contractor shall monitor, analyze and assess on a comprehensive, programmatic basis the progress and impact of the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training.  The contractor shall design mechanisms whereby pertinent baseline data will be collected to enable the program to benchmark progress and to document performance for the Government Performance and Results Act.  The contractor shall coordinate an assessment and mid-course review of the National Plan for Maternal and Child Health Training.   These activities shall include but are not limited to developing a strategy for involving and organizing key stakeholders and constituents, outlining a budget and timeline, and documenting the extent to which objectives have been achieved.  Activities may include mediating electronic communications in a variety of media which may include a web site, bulletin board service and selected internet focus groups.   Technical expertise and mechanisms for these efforts will be provided under a separate contract...  The contractor must be knowledgeable about MCHB training issues, particularly with an emphasis on interdisciplinary leadership training and qualified through training and experience to conduct the tasks.  The contractor shall have experience in developing and implementing successful data analysis and strategic planning management projects, including a track record in working with grantees in university based settings, with their particular opportunities and challenges. The contract or shall have a stable organization with experienced personnel.  Contractor should provide evidence that they have the administrative principles, project management, information management, quality monitoring, organizational leadership, customer service, and a knowledge base of MCHB training that is necessary for sound judgment, creativity, and technical expertise to be offered and an ability to respond in a timely and efficient manner. Potential sources/interested parties shall provide relevant information which specifically demonstrate the capabilities to perform the following:  The anticipated evaluation criteria include:  (1) Understanding the Project Requirements (2) The Technical Approach, and (3) Demonstrated Experience and Expertise.   Interested entities should submit their capabilities statements demonstrating the capability of performing this work.  Documentation may include both Government and commercial contract, references (names, telephone numbers and e: mail addresses) and any other information serving to document the organization’s capability to perform this work.  Capable organizations must be able to provide these services under contract over a five year period of time.  Your submission must be received in this office by 3:00 PM local time, Thursday , June 2, 2005 by delivery, surface mail or fax ONLY at the following address:   HHS/HRSA/DPM, attn:  Debora Pitts, 5600 Fisher Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD   20857; telephone (301) 443-3789; Fax (301) 443-5462.

<DESC>The National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) is seeking Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) that can provide scientific and engineering support for independent, objective assessments regarding the launch, space and ground systems for NOAA/NESDIS satellite systems.  

The incumbent contractor, The Aerospace Corporation, was awarded a contract in September 2000 to provide these services to NOAA/NESDIS.  If based on the results of this sources sought, it is determined that no other FFRDC can provide these services, then the Government intends to proceed with a sole source contract award to The Aerospace Corporation.  In that event, this synopsis meets the publication requirements of  a proposed sole source contract award to The Aerospace Corporation.  The contract will be for approximately 60 staff per year, effective November 30, 2005, for a base period of 1 year plus four (4) 1-year options. 

The NOAA/NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geo-stationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs.  The NOAA/NESDIS objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  The Contractor's role in the NOAA/NESDIS Organization is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the program acquisition objectives of the NOAA/NESDIS and related NOAA programs. The Contractor will  provide non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications.

The Aerospace Corporation is considered to be the single, experienced capable source qualified to support NOAA/NESDIS with the required independent engineering analyses. The Aerospace Corporation, a FFRDC, formed in 1960 by the USAF, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Sect. 2367, completed a Comprehensive Review in June 2003 that was approved by the Under Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development reaffirming The Aerospace Corporation’s mission to support national security, civil and commercial space programs.  The Aerospace Corporation’s personnel have first-hand knowledge of the engineering design of delivery systems and the spacecraft platforms of military and civilian polar-orbiting and geosynchronous spacecraft. The Aerospace Corporation’s experience includes the integration of military, civilian and foreign meteorological sensors, the impact of command, control and communications links between the ground control stations and the platforms/systems, and the analysis of satellite instrument data. The Aerospace Corporation maintains the unique competency and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms. Its corporate and business practices protect Government and industry's interests and objectives by safeguarding proprietary and privileged information from misuse, and reducing the Government's costs due to duplication, delay and other general programmatic risks. The Aerospace Corporation’s corporate resources and facilities help advance the Government objectives to promote competition, reduce costs of acquiring and operating the converged satellite systems, and satisfy the programmatic requirements for NOAA/NESDIS. The Government's reliance on The Aerospace Corporation for this unique competence and independent base of advanced skills validates the exception from full and open competition under 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1). Other parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their capabilities in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 calendar days of the posted date of this notice.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis for ParallelaVax" Rapid Vaccine Testing Technology
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Maxygen, Inc.  The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical/Biological Defense requires an optimized ParallelaVax"-based strategy for high-throughput vaccine development tha can be applied to other targets of interest to DoD; multiple subtype HIV-1 vaccine candidate immunogens resulting from application of the ParallelaVax" screening technology; and envelope-glycoprotein-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates r eady for screening in the ParallelaVax" platform.  This contract shall be issued using other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  It would take an unreasonably extended period of time to educate another contractor to a n acceptable level of knowledge where they could duplicate the capabilities of the ParallelaVax" system.  Maxygen and Aldevron have worked together developing the ParallelaVax" system with smaller scale studies.  The ParallelaVax" system was developed over  a three year period (2001-2004) with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation and internal funds of Maxygen and Aldevron.  The system employs the MolecularBreeding directed evolution technology, which is proprietary to Maxygen.  This team already  has the experience, personnel, equipment and facilities available to carry this work forward with minimum risk.  No other contractors have this system in place.  This is not a request for competitive proposals but parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services must furnish in writing, factual information, which clearly supports and demonstrates evidence of such abilities.  This information must be e-mailed to Leo Fratis at Leo.Fratis@us.army.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)619-5069 by close of business June 3, 2005.  A determination not to complete this proposed action based on any responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis
<DESC>Notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis the collection of regional economic data for fishery dependant boroughs and census areas in the Southwest region of Alaska with the School of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences, Mr. Hans Geier, Fairbanks, AK.  Mr Geier has worked continuously for over 15 years with the IMPLAN database which is the primary database applied to the Southwest Region of Alaska.  As such has an has equally intimate knowledge into Alaska’s rural regional economies, an understanding of the nature and structure of localized fishing industries and the personal skills, contacts and past experience with NOAA to conduct personal interviews to elicit the requisite information from an industry that has been proved in the past to be uncooperative with “outsiders”.  Therefore it is in the government’s opinion that in addition to survey work and IMPLAN knowledge, Mr. Geier’s past experience has also focused on budgets which translate to a practical framework for collecting and managing data appropriate for IMPLAN databases, which no one else has been found to be able to duplicate.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  This is a simplified acquisition not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

Development of a Training and Marketing Program for Retailers of ENERGY STAR Qualified Manufactured Homes.  BACKGROUND:  In 1992, the US Environmental Protection Agency launched the Energy Star® program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging the use of more energy-efficient products and appliances. This voluntary labeling program was highly successful and in the late 1990s, new homes, site-built and manufactured, were added to the roster of products that were eligible for the Energy Star label.  ENERGY STAR slowly gained a measure of acceptance in the site-built housing industry but struggled in the manufactured housing sector largely because the program procedures and requirements were not suited to the way manufactured homes were produced and sold.  Recognizing that the manufactured housing industry is the major provider of the nation’s affordable, unsubsidized housing, and therefore is an important factor in reducing household energy consumption, EPA began the process of adapting the Energy Star program to better reflect the construction, sales and installation methods that characterize manufactured housing.  In 2000, the Manufactured Housing Research Alliance (MHRA) developed technical procedures that later laid the ground work for what became the guidelines for constructing ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  Leveraging the industry’s existing quality control and inspection systems, the guidelines were adopted by EPA and converted into Energy Star program protocols.  To date ENERGY STAR's efforts have been in vetting the technical guidelines to interested plants and in bringing the manufacturers squarely into the ENERGY STAR program.  These efforts have been highly successful, with the majority of home manufacturers committing to the Energy Star program in the last 24 months.  However, support by the manufacturers is only one key to success in increasing ENERGY STAR's market penetration.  Manufactured home retailers and community owners play a key role in the success of marketing and installing these homes.  These groups are the interface with the home buyer and the sale of Energy Star qualified homes depends on their active participation in, and commitment to, the program. Not surprisingly, despite the high level of manufacturer support, actual sales of Energy Star qualified homes have thus far lagged due to the lack of marketing and education at the retail level.  The manufactured housing industry includes approximately 7,000 retailers, the majority of which are independent (not affiliated with a manufacturer). While the manufacturing and supplier segments of the industry are committed to the program, generating sales requires the buy-in and endorsement by the relatively large and fragmented retail sector.  Without the retailer actively and knowledgably marketing ENERGY STAR, sales of Energy Star Labeled Homes will languish.  To help ENERGY STAR address these program gaps, the Contractor shall develop a training and marketing program designed to educate and train manufactured home retailers, community developers, and manufacturer’s representatives in how to effectively market and sell Energy Star qualified homes.	OBJECTIVE:  The main objective of this project is to develop for the Residential Branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR Program a system of complimentary sales and marketing materials that explain how to market and sell ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  The main audience for the training and marketing program will be retailers, community developers, and manufacturer’s representatives.  This project is designed to better prepare retailers, community developers, and manufacturer’s representatives to sell ENERGY STAR qualified homes to the public, thus increasing these homes’ share of the overall affordable housing market.  This in turn will contribute to reducing household energy use and therefore reducing the production of air pollution.  TASKS:  Task 1 – Develop Training and Marketing Program for Retailers, Community Developers, and Manufacturer’s Representatives.  This task will lay the foundation for, and begin the process of, increasing sales of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes by providing manufactured home salespeople with the information necessary to effectively promote and communicate the benefits of ENERGY STAR to home buyers.  The primary products of this task will be training and educational program modules for retail and manufacturer salespeople and marketing materials for retailers to promote ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes to prospective home buyers.  This task shall consist of two subtasks: (1) Developing and implementing a sales training program for retailers, community developers and manufacturer’s representatives and, (2) Providing retailers with ENERGY STAR promotional materials they need to effectively sell ENERGY STAR qualified homes.  Subtask 1 – Develop Retailer and Community Developer/Owner Training Materials - The lack of awareness about ENERGY STAR at the retail level is evident in the fact that, even though a large number of plants are qualified to produce and are actively promoting ENERGY STAR qualified homes, few are actually being sold.  This is in large part due to the lack of a consistent and thorough training/educational program targeting retailers and community owners/developers, the critical links in the sales chain.  Most home purchase decisions are made at the retail sales center under the guidance of the salesperson and largely based upon information available at the sales center.  To commit to the added cost often associated with an ENERGY STAR qualified home, buyers need an accurate accounting of their benefits.  If the salesperson is not equipped to present and communicate the benefits, then there is little chance he or she will promote these benefits, nor is the buyer likely to purchase an ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured home.  To address this need, this subtask will consist of the following steps:  (1) The Contractor shall develop training curricula and the format for the training program.  These materials will provide critical information about the ENERGY STAR program, covering issues such as: ordering ENERGY STAR qualified homes from participating manufacturers, the benefits of ENERGY STAR construction, selling ENERGY STAR features, the role and responsibilities of retailers and community owners in the ENERGY STAR program, and other important ENERGY STAR information. (2) The Contractor shall integrate the information developed into already existing and widely used training tools, such as: the On-line Training and Education Center, accessed through the Manufactured Housing Institute’s (MHI) web site, and the Professional Housing Consultant: Selling Skills Module, a CD-based training tool provided by MHI.  These tools are used widely by industry for routine training of retail and sales staff.  MHI is the national trade organization representing the factory-built housing industry.  Subtask 2 – Develop Point of Sale Marketing Materials for Retailers - The dearth of promotional materials available to assist retailers in selling ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes is perhaps the single greatest reason why the number of qualified homes sold has lagged.  This subtask shall develop promotional products using existing EPA ENERGY STAR promotional materials for site builders as models.  Generic marketing materials will be developed for promoting ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes at the retail level, possibly including point-of-purchase displays, signage, sales literature, press kits, and generic advertisements.  Users of the materials would be able to co-brand with their company name.  As with other ENERGY STAR promotional materials, these items shall be made readily available to the manufactured housing community in several forms, including generic graphics in electronic format (on disk and available for download) and/or in printed form depending on their format. The Contractor shall develop content that will then be shaped into finished printed materials by EPA’s marketing contractor.  The steps in developing the point of sales materials include the following: (1) A committee will be assembled consisting primarily of manufacturers’ sales representatives and retailers having experience with, and interest in, the ENERGY STAR program.  (2) The committee will review existing promotional materials developed for site-built ENERGY STAR qualified homes as well as other related ENERGY STAR materials and relevant non-ENERGY STAR materials selected by research staff and committee members.  The committee will meet either in person or via conference call to discuss and debate modifications to the existing materials that will make them suitable for the manufactured housing market.  The Committee will also debate which forms of promotional materials (i.e., signage, brochures, videos, etc.) will be most effective.  This information will then be summarized in a brief report.  Substantial content for these materials (such as existing case studies of energy savings taken from actual ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes, estimates of energy savings, etc.) will be incorporated as part of this task.  The Contractor shall work closely with EPA’s marketing contractor to develop mock-ups and final graphics.  As with other EPA sales and promotion literature, these materials will be made part of EPA’s existing Energy Star Sales Tool Kit.  DELIVERABLES: (1) The Contractor shall provide a program syllabus and materials for use in training manufactured home retailers, community developers and manufacturer sales representatives with an emphasis on how to sell ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  The training materials developed shall be disseminated to manufactured home retailers across the country to include on-line dissemination, on-line training presence, and also training seminars to be held around the country.  The Contractor shall provide both a final hard-copy and an electronic copy of the training materials suitable for Web posting and for printing; (2) The Contractor shall provide a brief summary report in hard copy and electronic copy on the results of the committee discussions about developing point of sale marketing materials for retailers; (3) Consistent with how EPA has approached program marketing and promotion in the past, point of sale promotional materials shall be developed as part of this effort, packaged, and made available to the manufactured housing industry via EPA’s Hotline and Web site.  The Contractor shall provide EPA with a hard-copy and an electronic copy of all materials developed that are suitable for Web posting and for printing; (4) The Contractor shall write and publish in the trade press articles communicating the availability of the new training and promotional materials.  Articles shall appear in the state association publications, reaching most of the retailers directly, and in major industry periodicals such as Modern Homes.  A hard-copy and an electronic copy of the published articles shall be provided to EPA.  SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES:  Task 1 shall be conducted over a twelve month period.  Work on Subtasks 1 and 2 shall begin immediately upon receiving final approval from EPA.  Both subtasks shall be completed within about twelve months of receiving EPA approval to begin work.  The delivery schedule is as follows: 1) Outline for training program for retailers of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  Due Date:  No later than three months after award date.  2) Draft training syllabus and materials for retailers of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  Due Date:  No later than four months after delivery and acceptance of deliverable #1 by EPA. 3) Final training syllabus and materials for retailers of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.

<DESC>This amendment provides for a clarification to a question asked by a vendor:
Questions/Comment: " In going through the paperwork for the 5-year contract for HSTS03-05-R-CAO058, I did not find specific building sizes and cabinets, just general minimum and maximum sizes with options, etc.It will be difficult to give you pricing if I am not sure what you are looking for.  An example would be a 4 drum locker.  This can have SOME options added to it, but to add AC, Fire suppression, Heat , etc. would negate any room for storage.  These lockers also don't automatic close doors, but the larger ones do.  If I had more specific sizes then it would be much easier to quote. Freight is also a problem as I don't know which building would go to a specific location.  Each building must go on a flat-bed truck and freight is something that changes constantly.  Also each building or locker also goes by weight and that changes with the options needed or wanted. Each building is mfg'd to meet a specific need based on what is being stored and where the building will be located.  Each state has its own requirements along with the federal requirements.  Some states have a state seal or insignia that is required as well (NJ for one) and that is required on closed wall constructed bldgs if is NOT going on Federal land. Can you give me any insight as to what specifically is needed or a way to work this out?  Buildings are not built until I get a purchase order.  Each building is unique to what is stored and where its placed on the site along with what regulations need to be met."

Answer / Clarification: "Unfortunately, there is no way to say what specific size or sizes will be needed.  Nor is there any way to say where they will need to be shipped.  Our needs are driven by the needs of the airports and their specific requirements.  These requirements may or may not relate to airport size and location.  The bidder is correct for the larger outdoor storage buildings, they are built to order for the most part.  Perhaps it would be best to offer a increased delivery time and secondary approval of shipping cost prior to shipment.
Please note:  TSA does not anticipate the need to order a large number of outdoor storage units, like the ones being discussed.  The flammable storage cabinets 30gal, 45gal, 60 gal and 90 gal will be the lion's share of whats' needed."

Evaluation: Your offer will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria, which are considered to be of relative equal importance, exclusive of cost, which will be considered in the analysis of best value, will be used to evaluate and select a contractor for this award.  For any offerors that are equal in evaluation, cost (to include overall cost for shipment) will be the determining factor: 
Technical Capability Evaluation Criteria: Your technical capabilities, as demonstrated in both the written technical quotation, will be evaluated to determine your understanding and proven ability to provide the storage units as specified, maintain adequate stock and meet customer demands.  
Past Performance Evaluation Criterion: The following factor will be considered in evaluating the offeror’s past performance: demonstrated record (as confirmed by references) of successful past performance of the same or similar projects of this scope on time within budget.
Pricing Evaluation Criteria: The rates for the various types of storage units (discounted if provided) as well as the overall per delivery costs for shipment per location(s) will be analyzed. Discounts from the contractor’s catalog or market publication prices must be clearly stated.  The Government reserves the right to reject an offer in the event that the lack of balance in the pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.  Proposed pricing will be evaluated to determine whether they are necessary and reasonable for the conduct of the proposed future delivery orders or purchase card orders, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the methods of performance described in the offeror’s proposal.  Price proposals will not be compared against each firm to determine the best price.  Best value, in regards to superior technical proposals, will determine at what proposed and realistic cost will TSA award the contractor.	 

Special Notes:  For issued delivery orders, payment via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for each task will occur upon final acceptance of each deliverable and submission of a proper invoice.  Payment shall occur in US dollars.

Offers shall be submitted for all products solicited, i.e. all or none.	

Selection: The Government will select a contractor for this award on a best value basis.  In determining the best value, the Government will evaluate which offeror represents the greatest potential to provide the most-timely, efficient, and cost-effective flammable and chemical storage units for TSA.  

Any questions raised concerning this RFP must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. EST May 20, 2005.
