<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Lori A. Lawson, Contracting Officer, Email lawsonl@sec.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)

Requirements gathering for an SEC-wide automated litigation hold system.

This announcement is a Request for Information, not a solicitation. The SEC is issuing this RFI to gather information on the capabilities of industry and price estimates for the work outlined in the attached Draft Requirements document. If you are interested in providing information, please review the attachments and send all info. to Lori Lawson. You may include price range estimates. The SEC will consider all responses to this RFI as information only, not offers. All information must be sent via email to Lawsonl@sec.gov by no later than the response deadline. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires a comprehensive review by a contractor with industry standard expertise in e-discovery to gather requirements for an automated Litigation Hold System . Much of the agencys business is conducted electronically. However, operations are still being migrated from paper-based records to electronic records. The ever increasing amount of Electronically Stored Information (ESI) and the burden of requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and the recent case law have made it clear that the SEC needs the ability to automatically identify, preserve, collect and store ESI to facilitate e-discovery, conduct authorized internal investigations, and respond to time-sensitive Congressional inquiries.

The SEC seeks information to
 a)	Examine the current business process as it relates to litigation holds. Recommend process improvements based on e-discovery industry standards.
b)	Assess process to search, identify and collect electronic documents by date, to, from, subject, key words, metadata, and/or hash value.
c)	Assess process to search for electronic documents, including email attachments, throughout the SEC's electronic infrastructure, that is responsive to specified search criteria, without employee involvement and without disrupting employee use of computers.
d)	Identify limitations and shortfalls in the current manual procedure to collect ESI
e)	Assess process to store responsive electronic documents in a forensically- sound container that preserves ESI in its native format without altering metadata while documenting and maintaining a chain of custody via a tracking database.
f)	Conduct a comprehensive study of litigation hold software packages available in the market and recommend solutions that could potentially meet OGC's requirements.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Permit Project

Background

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is seeking interested responsible jurisdictions to assist their efforts with permitting electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.  

The overall objective of this effort is to increase the efficiency of the permitting process for EV charging stations.  

One option that can be used to increase the process efficiency is a standard permit for EV charging stations that would allow applicants to proceed with charging station installation if they agree to the permit conditions.  This standard permit or permit template has been used for installations where the equipment is relatively homogeneous.  The expectation is that EV charging stations will be relatively homogeneous.

NREL Support

NREL is interested in working with jurisdictions in streamlining their processes for EV charging station permitting.  NRELs assistance could take the form of:
  implementation of a permit template that NREL has developed, 
  providing background information on EV charging equipment or vehicles, or
  providing general safety information. 

If your jurisdiction is interested in working with NREL, please contact one of the individuals listed below.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Ft. Campbell, KY area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.

<a href="mailto:janet.r.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Savannah</a>
<DESC>The Savannah District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for large scale construction contracts (exceeding $25 million) within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries.   Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<BR><BR><BR>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <BR>b. The complexity of the project. <BR>c. Shortage of skilled labor in region. <BR>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<BR>e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects. <BR>f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <BR>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <BR>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <BR><BR>PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<BR><BR>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce labor-management stability, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.<BR><BR>Reference:<BR>Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement <BR>Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement<BR><BR>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <BR><BR>a.	Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Savannah District Boundaries?  What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Savannah Engineer District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<BR><BR>b.	Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs?  Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<BR><BR>c.	Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <BR><BR>d.	Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters?  Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <BR><BR>e.	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.  Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <BR><BR>f.	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <BR><BR>g.	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods.   Will a PLA impact the completion time?  What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?  Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<BR><BR>h.	Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <BR><BR>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <BR><BR>Please provide your comments via e-mail to CESAS-CT.SAS@usace.army.mil no later than 29 October 2010.<BR><BR>

<DESC>FUTURE ELECTRONIC WARFARE AND ELECTROMAGNETIC BATTLE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1. This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies available in the next decade to provide new or enhanced current electronic warfare battle management (EWBM) and electro-magnetic battle management (EMBM) capabilities in order to control the electromagnetic spectrum. As a follow up to the EW Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA), the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center's (JIOWC) Electronic Warfare Directorate (EWD) is leading the effort to address capability gaps #17 and #25 identified in the approved EW Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). JIOWC/EWD is interested in reviewing the state-of-the-art and emerging technologies applicable to all aspects of EMBM to include policy, users/operations and network architecture. The team seeks specific system solutions with an anticipated technology readiness level (TRL) of 7/8 within the next 8-10 years. To further facilitate communication of DoD's interests and how these potential solutions may address them, a Future EMBM Capabilities Industry Week will be conducted 8-10 November 2010 in the Atlanta, GA area. This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal but merely a request for information. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information received.</p>
<p>2. The Services, Combatant Commands, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense are currently examining current and proposed programs of record. The intent of the Future EMBM Capabilities Industry Week is to identify new and game-changing technologies and system upgrades that are not yet incorporated into existing or proposed DoD programs. Additionally, the DoD is interested in next-generation, game-changing technologies that will help shape long-term strategic investments. This is a broad data call that will include all domains (air, land, maritime, space, and cyber) and will focus on the warfighting functions of EW Battle Management and Electro-Magnetic Battle Management (EMBM) across all phases of combat. Company responses should include a one page cover letter, a narrative summary (no more than 3 pages), and briefing slides with the quad chart, as outlined on the website provided below, as the last slide. A Plan of Action and Milestones that describes how the new technology(s) will be matured to TRL 7/8 by 2020 should be included in the brief. The DoD will present further details of the issues/requirements to participants at a later date. One-on-one sessions with respondents will be scheduled during Industry week and presented to a government team that includes members from the JIOWC/EWD, the Services, Joint Staff, and OSD.</p>
<p>3. Submissions will be considered up to and including TS/SAP/SAR. Specific capabilities of interest will be available on the following SIPRNET website.</p>
<p>https://teams.jiowc.smil.mil/sites/ew/embm/Wiki%20Pages/EMBM%20BAA.aspx</p>
<p>4. Companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of classified responses. Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives. Companies are not limited to a single response. Submissions are due NLT 5 Nov 2010 by 8:00 AM EST and may be made by emailing the Primary POC listed in Section 8 of this Special Notice or by mailing your response on a compact disk and one original and 3 hard copies to:</p>
<p>Director, JIOWC/EWD<br />Attn: EW Battle Management Leads<br />2 Hall Blvd, Suite 217<br />San Antonio, Texas 78243-7074</p>
<p>5. This notice is part of the Government's market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" from industry with respect to their current and projected abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for EW capabilities. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. If respondents wish government support contractors to sign a non-disclosure agreement, please include the form in the response. The Government will not use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability, requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>6. Only U.S. companies doing business in or based in the U.S. will be permitted to receive the information package or respond to this request. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties. Any questions that involve the release of proprietary information (or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's possible solution) must be submitted in writing to the technical POC for review and would be answered in general terms as determined by the technical POC at JIOWC/EWD.</p>
<p>7. Technical point of contact is Lieutenant Commander Kevin Crockett, JIOWC/EWD/EW3, (210) 977-6666, kevin.crockett@jiowc.osis.gov.</p>
<p>8. This notice will be updated as additional information becomes available.</p>

<DESC><strong>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."</strong>
<p><br /><strong>Background</strong> - The Sperm Count and Vaginal Cytology Evaluations (SCVCE) are performed on tissues obtained from animals in the NTP's 90-day toxicity studies of environmental agents conducted at various NTP-designated laboratories, and provide a short-term "biomarker" test of potential reproductive toxicity. When instructed by the NTP Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR), these laboratories supply vaginal cytology slides and testicular tissue samples for SCVCE evaluations. The NTP has conducted more than 250 SCVC-Evaluations since the 1980's.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong> - The purpose of this contract is to support and assist the National Toxicology Program (NTP) research effort to analyze and evaluate homogenization resistant testicular spermatid heads and vaginal cytology for specimens (tissues and slides) provided by the NTP and provide a short-term "biomarker" test of potential reproductive toxicity. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, facilities, and equipment necessary to evaluate the effects of environmental agents on the vaginal cytology/estrus cyclicity and testicular sperm counts of laboratory animals (specifically, mice and rats), and report the results of these evaluations to the NTP.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that each SCVCE will require homogenization of frozen testes and the enumeration of the resistant spermatid nuclei from 10 male rats/group for 4 groups (3 dosed groups plus a control group); and 10 male mice/group for 4 groups (3 dosed groups plus a control group). The SCVCE will also include the interpretation of approximately sixteen daily vaginal washes from each of 10 female rats/group for 4 groups (3 dosed groups plus a control group) and 10 female mice/group for 4 groups (3 dosed groups plus a control group).</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project requirements</strong> - Sperm Count and Vaginal Cytology Evaluations (SCVCE) - The Contractor shall: <br />1) Analyze/evaluate testicular tissues and vaginal cytology slides from toxicity tests of environmental agents in laboratory rodents (rats and mice); and<br />2) Report the results of these evaluations; and <br />3) Develop protocols and reports; and <br />4) Provide technical procedures/training for personnel at designated toxicology laboratories preparing specimens for SCVC evaluations. Training shall include procedures/topics such as optimal methods of assessing sperm motility and velocity measurements by computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA), and optimization of methods for preparing vaginal cytology slides; and<br />5) Prepare and provide four (4) different Buffer Solutions for sperm assays.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have capability and experience in conducting GLP compliant reproductive toxicology studies with an SCVCE Component. <br />The Contractor shall comply with the following guidance/regulatory requirements: The NTP Health and Safety Minimum Requirements for Off-Site Contractors; the FDA Good Laboratory Practice Regulations for Non-Clinical Laboratory Studies; and applicable Federal, State, and Local Laws.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong> - The Base Contract is anticipated from September 2011 through September 2012 with four, one year optional periods of performance. If all options are exercised the period of performance shall extend through September 2016. <br /><br /><strong>Other important considerations</strong> - The Government estimates a workload of five (5) SCVCE evaluations per year (2 species/study). Optional quantities of SCVCE evaluations include options for a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 additional SCVCE evaluations per year.<br /><br /><strong>Information sought</strong> - Respondents, please provide opinion(s) about the difficulty and/or feasibility of proposing the potential requirement as a fixed price acquisition. Provide possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace for procuring the outlined services under fixed price terms.<br /><br /><strong>Submission requirements</strong> - Responses must be received by November 4, 2010, 3:00pm EST. Submit responses to the Contract Specialist identified above. Telephonic responses will not be accepted. Electronic responses are acceptable (Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Power Point, etc.).

<a href="mailto:scott.elaine@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider, AVAYA, Inc. for continued maintenance on EPA's National Decontamination Team's (NDT) satellite broadband service in the Mobile Communication Center (MCC).  It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source based on the fact that down time and additional costs would be incurred by EPA in terms of replacement equipment, training personnel for new equipment, etc. if a new vendor were to be chosen.  Market research has also shown that other companies offer service-only options but charge additioanl fees for service if their equipment is not utilized.  This would not be cost effective to the government. EPA's NDT is requesting satellite broadband service in the MCC for the next twelve (12) months. This service is necessary to maintain its spe cialized and redundant voice communication system.  There are six (6) objectives to this maintenance agreement: (1) Dedicated bandwidth at least ten days per month; (2) VOIPport configuration; (3) Twelve (12) month nationwide shared plan with unlimited call within the United States; (4) Service to four (4) lines in the MCC; (5) Data dedicated services with a minimum of 768 kbps up to Mbps and (6) Maintain continuity of current system operation and be compatible with the F-3 Datastorm satellite dish.
The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is:811213.  The period of performance for this award shall not exceed twelve (12) months.  EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the Government's best interest.  If there are other potential sources, please submit your capability statement no later than 12 noon, October 22, 2010 EST. to scott.elaine@epa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Battelle Memorial Institute, 1400 Centrepark Blvd. Suite 1005 West Palm Beach, FL 33401, under authority of FAR 6.302.  The contract to provide an external review for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project General Reevaluation Report (GRR) was originally competed and awarded to Battelle Memorial Institute. The U.S. Congress, in the 1999 Water Resources Development Act, conditionally authorized deepening the Savannah Harbor Navigation Project to a maximum controlling depth of 48 feet within the river channel contingent upon the completion of a GRR.  The Savannah District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed a GRR to determine the feasibility of improvements.  As required by United States Army Corps of Engineers regulations (EC 1105-2-209), an Outside Eligible Organization must be used by the National Deep Draft Navigation Planning Center of Expertise to conduct Independent External Peer Review of decision documents prior to consideration of approval and funding by Congress.  The Army Research Offices Scientific Services Program currently has a task order with Battelle Memorial Institute for the requirement for the independent external peer review. Battelles panel members were recruited, screened for availability, interest, and technical experience in defined areas of expertise, and any actual or perceived conflicts of interest were determined.  Battelle is under contract to complete review of study data by November 2010.  Therefore, a new contract award is needed to complete the remaining IEPR tasks.  Due to Battelle being one of the few established agencies qualified and experienced in establishing peer review panels for USACE, and their familiarity with the subject project, they are the only source capable of conducting the Independent External Peer Review of the decisions documents for the Savannah Harbor. It would be more costly to obtain another contractor who is unfamiliar with the project and the current November 2010 completion schedule date could be jeopardized. In addition to delays, it could also jeopardize current funding. The (NAICS) code is 541990 and size standard is $7.0 Mil.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent by email to Geanette Kelley, at geanette.kelley@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR><BR>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for project to Re-pave and Expand Existing Parking Lot at North Side of Hospital, Bldg.-200 on Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Campus, Hines, Illinois.

3.	A description of supplies/services required:  Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, Hines, IL has a high priority need for the Repaving of Existing Parking Spaces and Construction of New Parking Areas, location at North End of Hospital Bldg.-200 on Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Campus, Hines, Illinois.   Work will include asphalt, concrete, some sewage piping replacement, painting, signage, landscaping and miscellaneous ground work.  Market research through NAICS specific 237310 shows 16 SDVOSB KR's (contractors) in the Cook County, IL area and 43 statewide.  VSGI LLC is the KR under consideration for this project.  Based on meeting all requirements of market research, discussions with COTR and VSGI, and past performance, it is therefore recommended that the VA seek the services of VSGI LLC as a sole source, SDVOSB small business contractor for this project.

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2, FAR 6.302-5.(b)(6), and 15USC 657(f) - Sole Source Veterans Benefit Act.

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  VSGI LLC specializes in the area of paving and grounds construction and  has ongoing parking lot projects currently in progress. VSGI has experience at VA Hines Campus on several parking lot projects past and present as a JOC contractor.  The Hines VA staff and project engineer on similar projects are also recommending  the services of VSGI LLC.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  N/A -Sole source to SDVOSB small business, trade # (NAICS 237310) per VAAR, FAR, and Statutes. 

7.   Determination that the price is fair & reasonable:  The CO and COTR will review the pricing offered by VSGI LLC upon receipt of the RFP, comparison to the IGE, and negotiation for lower price using T-LOA (Tech Letter of Agreement) and PNM (Price Negotiation Memorandum).  RS-Means cost breakdown will be used by VSGI quote/RFP.

8.  A description of the market research conducted or statement why market research was not conducted:  VSGI LLC is registered in CCR, D&B, EPLS (no findings), ORCA, VETS-100, and certified in Vet-Biz.  They are compliant in all categories, and listed as a small firm, 6 employees, based on NAICS 237310 size limit of $33.5M.

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  There is concurrent work being performed on four (4) other North parking lots at the Hines VA by VSGI LLC.  This project, South Dakota Parking Lot, is the 5th and final North parking lot to be completed by end of this year.  Due to JOC lack of funding (money spent on emergency boiler repairs), I am submitting request to proceed with a new, sole source RFP, single project contract to complete work in concurrence with other ongoing parking lot projects by VSGI LLC.  The funding was initially available in the JOC contract to complete this work.  Failure to utilize VSGI LLC will result in higher costs and time delay if bid to open market or set-aside for SDVOSB open bid.

10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  N/A

11.  Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  N/A

12.  Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers.

Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these two SINs on Schedule 73,  which will require green certification.

Certification can be obtained through the website at www.energystar.gov.   For SIN 375-361 (Attachment 4), all items must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S.

The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the Energy Star or USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.  The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. Per Refresh 10, any paper offer received after March 10, 2010 will be rejected as non-responsive.  Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror.  The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 73 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 10.  Any eOffer received after November 22, 2010 containing Refresh 11 documentation will be rejected.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p><br />Price</p>
<p>All evaluation factors other than cost and price, when combined are more important than cost or price. As the technical evaluation of quotations approaches equality, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more quotations are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent) award may be made to the lower priced quotation.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

These requirements are found in the Code of Federal Regulations at:  36 CFR 7.13 (October 5, 2010 electronic edition).
The following are the specific regulations pertaining to best available technology for snowmobiles:
"(5) Must I operate a certain model of snowmobile? Only commercially available snowmobiles that meet NPS air and sound emissions requirements as set forth in this section may be operated in the park. The Superintendent will approve snowmobile makes, models, and years of manufacture that meet those requirements. Any snowmobile model not approved by the Superintendent may not be operated in the park.(6) How will the Superintendent approve snowmobile makes, models, and years of manufacture for use in the park? (i) Beginning with the 2005 model year, all snowmobiles must be certified under 40 CFR part 1051, to a Family Emission Limit no greater than 15 g/kW-hr for hydrocarbons and to a Family Emission Limit no greater than 120 g/kW-hr for carbon monoxide.----------(B) The snowmobile test procedures specified by EPA (40 CFR parts 1051 and 1065) must be used to measure air emissions from model year 2004 and later snowmobiles.(ii) For sound emissions, snowmobiles must operate at or below 73 dBA as measured at full throttle according to Society of Automotive Engineers J192 test procedures (revised 1985). Snowmobiles may be tested at any barometric pressure equal to or above 23.4 inches Hg uncorrected. The Superintendent may revise these testing procedures based on new information and/or updates to the SAE J192 testing procedures.(iii) Snowmobiles meeting the requirements for air and sound emissions may be operated in the park for a period not exceeding 6 years from the date upon which first certified.(iv) The Superintendent may prohibit entry into the park of any snowmobile that has been modified in a manner that may adversely affect air or sound emissions."
The National Park Service maintains a list of Best Available Technology approved snowmobiles. The list is found at:  
http://www.nps.gov/yell/parkmgmt/current_batlist.htm
The current BAT list posted on the web site include through MY2010 model year. Snowmobile manufacturers have begun to submit BAT certification information for the 2011 model year.  To date, Yamaha and Bombardier Recreational Products have applied and received BAT certification for certain 2011 model year snowmobiles.  The specific model information is available upon request.  To date, Polaris and Arctic Cat have not submitted MY2011 information. If a potential bidder is proposing Arctic Cat or Polaris snowmobiles, contact information for these companies can be provided upon request.

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(c), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The US Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center intends to award a purchase order to HandySoft Global Corporation, 1952 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA.  HandySoft Global Corporation is the owner and developer of the COTS BizFlow software. As such, HandySoft is the only firm with access to the source code of this COTS product. Because of its unique status, HandySoft is the vendor that developed all of the customizations currently implemented in EWITS for which HRESM requires on-going O&M support (including issue resolution and application maintenance services). As part of the development of the EWITS, HandySoft developed an in-depth knowledge of several HHS HR systems, including Capital HR (formerly EHRP) and QuickHire, with which EWITS interacts via intricate data interfaces. In-depth knowledge of the systems with which EWITS interacts in addition to its knowledge of the interfaces themselves is of unique value to HHS, and is another reason for supporting the continued relationship with HandySoft for ongoing application development. Because of its specialized knowledge and expertise with the BizFlow COTS and the associated EWITS applications and interfaces, HandySoft is the only vendor that can resolve customer issues with existing EWITS functionality and that can implement additional enhancements to support additional functional requirements to address HHS business process and HR reporting requirements. Because HandySoft is the owner and developer of the BizFlow COTS product, all other vendors in the marketplace with a customer requirement for changes to the source code in the Bizflow COTS product must also acquire those services solely from HandySoft by establishing a direct contracting relationship.  The HandySoft BizFlow COTS now serves as the basis for EWITS and is an integral part of the HR enterprise architecture for the Department. As such, EWITS interfaces with other HR systems, including Capital HR and Locator

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate</p>
<p>peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations and management for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in the field, and also in the U.S. The Senior Management Advisor provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and expertise. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division or his/her designee which may be the Chief of Field Programs Division or Country Team Leaders, and spends the majority of his or her time working side by side with OTI country program implementation teams in the Field and in Washington.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided</p>
<p>that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Monitoring and Information Officer</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem/ladder" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-12 (salary range: $60,274 - $78,355) or GS-13 (salary range: $71,674 - $93,175) equivalent level, non-locality pay.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Afghanistan</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States Government's (USG) top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to hire a qualified individual to support the OTI country team in the monitoring, evaluation, and information outreach of the OTI country program.</p>

<p>Applicants are required to address each of the Evaluation Factors on a separate sheet describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor. Be sure to include your name and the announcement number at the top of each additional page. Failure to specifically address the Selection and/or Evaluation Factors may result in your not receiving credit for all of your pertinent experience, education, training and/or awards.</p>
<p>The Applicant Rating System is as Follows:<br />Evaluation Factors have been assigned the following points:<br />Factor #1 - 20<br />Factor #2 - 15<br />Factor #3 - 15<br />Factor #4 - 10<br />Factor #5 - 10<br />Total Possible - 70 Points</p>

<p>APPLYING:</p>
<p>Applications must be received by the closing date and time at the address specified in the cover letter.</p>
<p>NOTE: Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-12 and GS-13 positions carefully. Applicants must submit a separate application for each position for which they wish to be considered. In most cases, this would simply require a small change to the cover page (e.g., indicating an application for the GS-12 or GS-13 position). Applicants must be cautious: those who submit an application for the GS-13 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-12 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position. On the other hand, applicants who apply for only the GS-12 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-13 position will not be considered for the GS-13 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-13 position.</p>

<p>NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged. A submitted resume, however, is considered supplemental application material. Submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being considered for employment.</p>
<p>All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Dates (months/years) and locations for all field experience must also be detailed.</p>
<p>2. A supplemental document specifically addressing: <br />Each of the Education/Experience requirements shown in the solicitation.<br />Each of the five (5) Evaluation Factors shown in the solicitation.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Evaluation Factors are worth 70 out of 100 points. Applicants are required to address each of the Evaluation Factors on a separate sheet describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify technologies that provides occupant protection and ground vehicle survivability.<BR><BR>The intent is to identify state of the art occupant protection and vehicle survivability systems through a self-assessment made by each respective participant. A system may be a single technology or a combination of technologies and must be minimally at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (see Table I).<BR><BR>DESIRED CAPABILITIES<BR><BR>The Army seeks to enhance current and future Ground System survivability by providing threat detection, hit/kill prevention, and protection for the crew, passenger, and vehicle, while preserving vehicle payload, mobility, fuel efficiency, and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability-Durability (RAM-D) capabilities. Emphasis will be placed on survivability technologies that demonstrate the ability to be scalable, modular, and easily integrated onto a military vehicle. Affordability, minimal weight, and small space claim are key attributes. It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated to provide a synergistic protective effect and not simply a cumulative effect of layering individual technology capabilities. The following are attributes the Army is seeking to include:<BR><BR>a. 360 hemispherical, lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from armor piercing direct fire <BR>b. Lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from blast events and fragmentation, including both side and underside threats<BR>c. Incoming threat detection and notification (i.e. sniper fire, RPGs, etc.)<BR>d. Survivability technologies to address Improvised Explosive Device or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (IED/EOD)<BR>e. Technologies to suppress/mitigate both internal and external vehicle fires.<BR>f. Non-Lethal technology that could be used for crowd control or to subdue individuals without causing permanent injury<BR>g. Safety applications to enhance crew survivability, including seat restraints, specialized seat configurations, rapid egress technologies, crew compartment coating to cushion soldier impact from vertical/lateral acceleration<BR>h. Soldier 360o hemispherical visualization during day and night operations and in all weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, rain, etc.)<BR>i. Hazardous agent detection within operating environment<BR>j. Technologies that defend against RPGs, ATGMs, and/or EFPs<BR>k. Signature Management technologies or designs that reduce the thermal, acoustic, or RF signature of the vehicle system<BR>l. Other technologies that enhance crew, passenger, and system survivability, excluding automotive components that impact mobility and technologies used to aid tactical planning<BR><BR><BR>RESPONSES: <BR><BR>Responses are requested no later than 45 days after announcement post. The Government will begin technology analysis following the 45 day submission period. Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to dami_tardecmarketsurvey@conus.army.mil and include name, phone, and email address for response.

<DESC>2010 TARDEC Survivability Market Survey<BR><BR>OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify technologies that provides occupant protection and ground vehicle survivability.<BR><BR>The intent is to identify state of the art occupant protection and vehicle survivability systems through a self-assessment made by each respective participant. A system may be a single technology or a combination of technologies and must be minimally at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (see Table I).<BR><BR>DESIRED CAPABILITIES<BR><BR>The Army seeks to enhance current and future Ground System survivability by providing threat detection, hit/kill prevention, and protection for the crew, passenger, and vehicle, while preserving vehicle payload, mobility, fuel efficiency, and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability-Durability (RAM-D) capabilities. Emphasis will be placed on survivability technologies that demonstrate the ability to be scalable, modular, and easily integrated onto a military vehicle. Affordability, minimal weight, and small space claim are key attributes. It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated to provide a synergistic protective effect and not simply a cumulative effect of layering individual technology capabilities. The following are attributes the Army is seeking to include:<BR><BR>a. 360 hemispherical, lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from armor piercing direct fire <BR>b. Lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from blast events and fragmentation, including both side and underside threats<BR>c. Incoming threat detection and notification (i.e. sniper fire, RPGs, etc.)<BR>d. Survivability technologies to address Improvised Explosive Device or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (IED/EOD)<BR>e. Technologies to suppress/mitigate both internal and external vehicle fires.<BR>f. Non-Lethal technology that could be used for crowd control or to subdue individuals without causing permanent injury<BR>g. Safety applications to enhance crew survivability, including seat restraints, specialized seat configurations, rapid egress technologies, crew compartment coating to cushion soldier impact from vertical/lateral acceleration<BR>h. Soldier 360o hemispherical visualization during day and night operations and in all weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, rain, etc.)<BR>i. Hazardous agent detection within operating environment<BR>j. Technologies that defend against RPGs, ATGMs, and/or EFPs<BR>k. Signature Management technologies or designs that reduce the thermal, acoustic, or RF signature of the vehicle system<BR>l. Other technologies that enhance crew, passenger, and system survivability, excluding automotive components that impact mobility and technologies used to aid tactical planning<BR><BR><BR>RESPONSES: <BR><BR>Responses are requested no later than 45 days after announcement post.
