<DESC>17.	Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate/Power Division (AFRL/PRP) solicits research proposals for Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space.  The Power Division (AFRL/PRP) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to develop, demonstrate and improve upon key power and thermal technologies supporting air and space applications in the areas of Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The technical improvements in these four areas will contribute toward meeting the Power Division's goals in the 2009 and beyond timeframe, and goals deemed necessary to facilitate nearer-term transition or transfer.   

Power and thermal technologies for aircraft support the integrated goals of the joint DoD/NASA/Industry More Electric Initiative.  Advanced power technologies support the initiative to develop directed energy weapons and place these weapons on airborne platforms.  The airborne use of directed energy weapons is driving the onboard electrical power requirements beyond the limits of conventional electrical power and thermal management systems and has driven the need to develop the necessary power generation, distribution and conditioning technologies required for the airborne use of these weapons.  Power technologies for space applications develop innovative technologies to reduce spacecraft size and weight, increase efficiency, increase operational life and develop affordable spacecraft.  

The over arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of a 7-year open-ended solicitation spanning the four major technology areas of Power Generation, Power Management and Distribution, Energy Storage and Subsystem Integration for Air and Space applications.  This strategy will provide AFRL/PRP an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs on a “real-time” basis as ever-changing technology issues are identified.  

The BAA will remain “open” for 7 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during "calls".  Each call will identify solicitation topics and will contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission.  

The first “call” for proposals occurs with the issuance of this BAA.  Refer to Part 5 of the solicitation for detailed information concerning the Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Scientific Research Program.  This program will sponsor scientific research and early development of materials, thermal concepts, battery cells and others, in the following four major research areas in which problems frequently arise which require unique and innovative solutions: Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The anticipated funding for this program is $49M.

Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to deliver the National Highway Institute’s (NHI) existing course #134057, “Transportation Asset Management.” Transportation Asset Management is a strategic approach to managing physical transportation infrastructure. The course presents issues and recommended practices for a systematic process of preserving, upgrading and operating physical assets cost effectively. It combines engineering principles with sound business practices and economic theory, and provides tools to facilitate a more organized, logical approach to decision-making. This introductory one-day training course is targeted to the executive, top and mid management levels of a state Department of Transportation.

The resulting contract will be for two years, with three 1-year options to address continuing requirements.

This is a full and open Commercial Item solicitation being conducted under FAR Part 12 procedures. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

For the purpose of assisting those companies interested in this new training effort, we are taking two preliminary steps. First, we will quickly post a DRAFT of key sections of the proposed RFP. This is strictly for your information, and may be altered in any way prior to the official release of the RFP. Offerors are cautioned to use this only for planning purposes, and to read the actual RFP carefully when it is released.

Secondly, we are planning to hold a preproposal conference for interested companies at the NHI offices in Ballston, Virginia on May 22nd. The conference will be lead by the Contracting Officer and the Program Manager to both provide an overview of the RFP and resulting contract, and to answer your questions. We will have representatives of our Asset Management Office in attendance to explain the program and its goals.

 Inasmuch as our space is limited, we may need to have more than one session. In order to avoid having to turn people away, you MUST preregister for the conference. We will acknowledge your registration request, provide you with the specific location and assign you a time. Anyone who just shows up without having received an acknowledgement and time assignment should expect to be turned away.

To register for the conference, send an e-mail to Bob.Prior@fhwa.dot.gov. Please state the number of people who will be attending. Again, due to limited space, please send as few as necessary to meet your needs.

We will track the questions and answers from the conference(s) and post them here on FedBizOpps for the benefit of all.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. However, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements and notifications of postings by e-mail.

Please note that FedBizOpps has added a new feature called Interested Vendors List. Those interested in subcontracting, supplying, consulting and the like should register, and prime contractors should review the names posted there.

Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is May 23, 2003. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation, Short-Term Lending Program offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate. For further information, call (800) 532-1169. Internet address: http://osdbuweb.dot.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Research, Development, and Technology (RD&T) Office of Operations, R&D has a requirement for technical support and assistance in its ongoing assessment of telecommunication systems and technologies that support various aspects of surface transportation.  Technical support is needed to assist FHWA in decisions that will ultimately determine where additional telecommunications resources will be needed to improve the safety and efficiency of the nation’s transportation infrastructure. A wide array of communications system approaches and technologies will be examined to determine their utility in supporting the transportation communications systems requirements.  This will include the development of representative systems design for promising candidate communication systems, the identification of test and evaluation needs to verify system performance, and the fabrication and test of system prototypes under realistic field settings.   Continued development of the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) standards will be a significant part of this effort.  In addition to DSRC, technical assistance to support FHWA in reviewing and assessing other communication technologies that support the Intelligent Vehicle Initiative will be needed.  In some instances the technical support will take the form of performing theoretical studies.  In others instances, there may be the need to implement specific hardware and software to support testing by other organizations or an end-to-end test for evaluation purposes.   There will also be the need to evaluate communication standards that have been under development for the last several years.

This effort is a follow-on to an existing contract, the Technical Support of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Communication Systems, Contract No. DTFH61-99-C-00018.  The initial focus of this previous effort was to examine communication systems that could support transportation by providing information to travelers, infrastructure managers, and others as needed.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract with a 36-month base period of performance with two one-year options.  NO FURTHER SOLICITATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This solicitation will be available electronically through the electronic posting system (www.eps.gov). No written, telephonic, facsimile or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will be accepted. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for any solicitation amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by FHWA.

Activities shall include, but are not limited to, data analysis and data management for data retrieved from clinical research grants, audits clinical research project data, provides statistical support, and archives clinical research data of national importance.  A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  KAI has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff’s familiarity with the various on-going clinical trials supported by the NINDS.  KAI is in the most optimal position to provide this work in a timely and cost-effective manner.  This organization has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for the additional labor effort unfeasible.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 514199   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL  ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6,   AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS  NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL   NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00445 and the solicitation  is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15. The  associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 514199 and the size  business size standard is $5.0 million. Full and open competition procedures will be utilized. A  firm, fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this  solicitation. This procurement is for the development of an oil composition and property database. STATEMENT OF WORK: Oil Composition and Properties for Oil Spill Modeling : U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing models for application to environmental problems associated with  accidental spills and releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and other multicomponent oils (collectively denoted "oils" hereafter).  Properties of the oils may be dependent upon the oil phase composition and as such may change during weathering.  Because of the large number of components in oils and  the impossibility of complete characterization EPA wishes to create a data set that is based upon fractionation of the oils into groups of compounds with similar structures and properties.   Because of the possibility of funding only a portion of the work, EPA desires that itemized bids be prepared  for the items listed below.  The itemization for tasks 2-5 should include the cost per oil for each task. 1) Develop a draft quality assurance project plan (QAPP).  EPA requires a quality assurance project plan for all research projects collecting or manipulating environmental data.  Information on  EPA QAPP requirements can be found at http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r5-final.pdf.  The QAPP shall include information on all methods, approaches, record-keeping, detection limits, accuracy of results, etc. as warranted for the project.  All reports and documents shall be provided to EPA in  electronic format (WordPerfect, other only by approval of EPA).  All figures shall be embedded within the report and supplied in the required word processor format.  The attached list of WordPerfect formatting requirements (attachment 1) should be carefully reviewed and shall be followed by the  contractor in preparing all documents for this contract.  EPA shall provide review comments on the QAPP within 15 business days.  For each EPA comment, the contractor shall either a) accept the comment and revise the report appropriately or b) reject the comment and provide a written justification  to EPA.  A reconciliation letter shall be prepared that lists each comment and the contractors response.  Response to minor comments that address spelling, punctuation, or grammar can be omitted, but EPA expects  serious consideration of these comments also. Draft QAPP Due: Award plus three weeks.  Final QAPP Due: Award plus eight weeks. 2) Obtain and Weather Samples of Crude Oils and Petroleum Products.   The contractor shall obtain crude oil and petroleum products.   The oils shall be weathered through volatilization, so that samples are available for the testing specified below. Samples  shall be prepared for 0% weathering, one-third of maximum weathering, two-thirds of maximum weathering, and maximum weathering.  EPA desires that data be collected on a total of nine oils.   A prior study used Alaska North Slope, South Louisiana, No. 2 Fuel Oil, West Texas Intermediate, Alberta  Mixed Sweet Blend, Arabian Light, Sockeye, No. 5 Fuel Oil, and Heavy Fuel Oil, which are all of interest to EPA.    The oils listed above are examples that span the range of interests of EPA.  Oils with similar characteristics may be substituted subject to the approval of the EPA. 3) Fractionate  the Oils. The contractor shall propose an approach to fractionating the oils into various classes and subclasses.  EPA favors methods developed by the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons Criteria Working Group (TPHCWG) (see www.aehs.com), because it includes estimates of the transport and toxicological  properties of the fractions.   Other approaches may be proposed and justified.  The fractionation approach, its background and justification shall be supplied in the proposal.  4) Physical Measurements.  Measurements of the oil density, viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension in fresh and  sea water (30 ppt or more) are required for each fraction of each oil, at each level of weathering and at temperatures of  5ohhgC, 15oC and 30oC. 5) Composition in Terms of Fractions.  The composition of the oils shall be determined based on the amount of each fraction present in each oil.  These  data shall be measured for each degree of weathering of each oil included in the study. 6) Interim Reports Interim reports are required that present the data collected under tasks 2 through 5 for each oil.  Thus an interim report that contains the data for each oil analyzed is required.  These  reports shall be accompanied by a spreadsheet file (MS Excel or Lotus 123, or any other with prior approval of EPA) containing all data values. Since it is anticipated that the required time to perform analyses for each oil is about 2 weeks, then interim reports are expected at 3 week intervals  beginning 11 weeks after the award. 7) Final Report.   Document the results in the style of a standard project report that shall be submitted to EPA for review.  The report should contain an introduction, literature review, materials and methods section, presentation of data, results and  conclusions, bibliography, and data appendices.   Any previous data submitted shall be included in the report.   All reports and documents shall be provided to EPA in electronic format (WordPerfect , other with demonstrated capacity to match attached formatting requirements only by approval of EPA)   All figures shall be embedded within the report and supplied in the required word processor format.  A separate set (i.e., individual figures not embedded in the document) of the embedded figures shall be supplied in electronic format.   The attached list of WordPerfect formatting requirements  should be carefully reviewed and shall be followed by the contractor in preparing all documents for this contract.  EPA shall provide review comments on the report within 15 business days of receipt of the draft final report.  For each EPA comment, the contractor shall either a) accept the comment  and revise the report appropriately or b) reject the comment and provide a justification.  A reconciliation letter shall be prepared that lists each comment and the contractors response.  Response to minor comments that address spelling, punctuation, or grammar can be omitted, but EPA expects   serious consideration of these comments also. Draft Final Report: Due award plus 38 weeks. Final Report: Due Award plus 43 weeks. Selection Criteria : EPA will select a vendor based upon both cost and technical factors so that the Agency receives the best value for this purchase, with technical  factors being significantly more important than cost. 1. Technical Approach:  To include completeness and innovativeness of the response to this solicitation, characteristics of the proposed oils, characteristics, accuracy and limitations of the proposed method for fractionation of the oils,  characteristics, accuracy and limitations of proposed analytical methods for determination of oil composition and characteristics, accuracy and limitations of proposed methods for physical characterization of oil fractions. 2. Documented prior experience in analyzing crude oils and petroleum  products. 3. Past Performance: Please provide contact information for at least three  recent customers (within the past three years) for similar work. WordPerfect Formatting Requirements: EPA requires that documents be formatted in a flexible fashion.  The following requirements shall be followed  for producing reports. Examples can be supplied upon request. 1.) Document.  A "master" document shall be used to create the report.  Each chapter or section of the report shall be contained in a "subdocument" that is a separate WordPerfect file. The report shall be generated by expanding the  master document. 2.) Contents.   A table of contents, table of figures, and table of tables shall be included using WordPerfect's "table of contents" and list generation capabilities. (No "hard-coded" table of contents, table of figures, and table of tables shall be accepted.) 3.) Numbering.   References to all chapter, section, subsection, etc., figure, table and equation numbering shall be created using the WordPerfect cross-referencing capability.  (No "hard-coded" references shall be accepted.)  4.) Tables.  All tables shall be contained within table boxes.  These are created using  the "insert", "graphics", and "custom boxes" menus.  Table captions shall be created using the table box caption. All table boxes shall be anchored to the "character," (despite any defaults that anchor boxes to the "page.")5.)

Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Boro Bjelbork, Manager of Direction for Transmission and Operation, Elektropriveda BiH, Vilsonovo sealiste 15, 7100 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ph: +387-33-751-301, Fax: +387-33-751-302.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a pilot project for demonstrating how internal communication services can be multiplexed with other services to support telecommunication offerings such as telephony, data services and bulk bandwidth to outside businesses.

Public Enterprise Elektroprivreda of Bosnia and Herzegovina (EP BiH) is one of three electric companies that provide electrical services in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). During the war their power generation, transmission and distribution systems were cut and partly destroyed. EPBiH has restored and stabilized their generation, transmission and distribution systems due to loans and grants provided by donor countries and by various banks.

Since the transmission network was heavily damaged during the war, the lines are being repaired to restore stable electric service. The World Bank has contributed $9 million towards the purchase and installation of fiber optic cables (Optical Ground Wire Cable – OPGW) along EPBiH’s transmission lines. EPBiH is also working with the World Bank to install a SCADA system (“SCADA project”), which will allow remote control of generation and transmission systems and will reduce manpower and operational costs. Through this project more than 1300 km of OPGW cable, as well as SDH backbone network and PDH access network will be provided for all three power companies in BiH.

Since August 2003, EPBiH had installed around 550 km of OPGW cable all over the country. These cables will provide high quality communications system needed for power system management and additionally will enable EPBiH to provide telecommunications services to other companies in BiH. EPBiH did not wait for the SCADA project to start modernizing its telecommunications system. EPBiH has installed SDH and flexible multiplexes network in Sarajevo, Zenica and Tuzla regions, realized data communication network using Cisco routing technology and public and private telecommunications resources and modernized private telephone network using ISDN switching systems and common channel signaling.

A Pilot project should be the next step in building a modern telecommunications system of EP BiH. During this project EPBiH expects to build the multiservice IP network, which should integrate some of the existing telecommunications services, provide some new services and give EPBiH’s telecommunications personnel opportunity to learn how to use and manage a network built with the emerging technologies. EPBiH’s personnel are expecting to gain valuable experience, which would be very useful in case that EPBiH forms a separate company, with telecommunications as a primary business.

Pilot Project will have a budget of $1,008,000. USTDA will contribute $504,000, while US equipment vendor (Phase II Contractor) is expected to provide up to $504,000 in cost-sharing. If a vendor cannot be found that is willing to cost share the Pilot project cost at $504,000, then Pilot project design must be changed to provide an alternative pilot project that reflects USTDA’s contribution and the vendor’s level of cost-sharing.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., October 27, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>(a) The Government intends to release Request for Proposal No. FA8820-04-R-0001 between the 1st and 31st of October 2003 for the Space Based Radar (SBR) Concept Development effort. SBR is an ACAT 1D program currently entering Acquisition Phase A as defined in NSS 03-01. The Space Based Radar Program is administered by Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (AFSPC/SMC) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), in coordination with the Services and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).  The SBR system is a transformational system for the DoD and the Intelligence Community that will provide persistent global collection of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) products.  The system will have the following core capabilities: collect Surface Moving Target Indication (SMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, and High-Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) data; exploit space and ground communications systems to move collected data from space to ground; process and disseminate collected data to support both national and theater BMC3 systems. (b) The JPO will be beginning the process of awarding a concept development contract that will allow development of the system through the Increment 1. The acquisition strategy is to conduct a best value, progressive competition/down-selection. The source selection will result in the award of one or possibly two contracts with performance through System Design Review (SDR) plus six months.  The formal RFP will be issued in October 2003 by the SBR Joint Program Office (JPO) at Space and Missile Systems Center. Proposals will be due 45 days later with an anticipated contract award date in Mar 04. If one contract is awarded, the contract will be a cost-plus award fee arrangement. If two contracts are awarded, the contract will be a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement. At the development milestone of SDR, the Government will request a Call for Improvement (CFI) proposal. This CFI will be used to conduct and evaluate a progressive down-selection intended to identify the single contractor offering the superior (best value) design approach to continue the development and manufacture of the SBR system. It is anticipated that only those contractors participating in the preceding phase will be capable of successfully competing for the next phase contract awards, although other offerors will not be precluded from consideration at the down-selection decision point. (c) The contractors will be required to submit a priced proposal for the first phase of this effort through SDR plus six months, and evidence of affordability of the total system. This will allow the Government to judge best value through SDR and judge the affordability of the system. While the Government intends to down-select at the System Design Review (SDR), we reserve the right not to, and either extend the parallel development effort to a future down-selection milestone or to proceed with a full and open competition if that approach is determined to be in the Government’s best interest. (d) Industry comments to the draft RFP can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.losangeles.af.mil/smc/sbr/index.htm.  Industry is encouraged to monitor this web site for information.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. David Ganger at (310) 363-0588. Technical questions/comments can be addressed to LtCol Luke Schaub at (310) 363-3114, contracting questions can be directed to Mr. David Block at (310) 363-3819 or to Trish Middleton at (310) 363-5627.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market HOMER v2.0 software program.  HOMER is the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (http://www.nrel.gov/homer/default.asp).  In short, HOMER is a computer model that helps design standalone electric power systems.  You give it information about electrical loads, renewable resources, and component costs, and HOMER designs the optimal power system to serve those loads.  The newest version of HOMER, v2.0, expands the utility of HOMER beyond the off-grid market into the grid connect distributed generation market.  
HOMER identifies the lowest-cost system for particular applications by simulating the hourly performance of a number of systems and ranking them by net present cost.  It can explore combinations of renewable energy technologies and by using sensitivity analysis determine the optimal economic, least-cost design.  HOMER can also compare stand alone vs. grid connect systems.

To date, 2270 people have downloaded HOMER in 135 countries.  Some of the organizations currently using HOMER are: Cagayan Electric Power & Light Co, Northern Power Systems, International Centre for Application of Solar Energy (CASE)
Perth, WA, Australia, and ÅF-Industriteknik AB, Sweden.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market HOMER v2.0 software program.  HOMER is the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (http://www.nrel.gov/homer/default.asp).  In short, HOMER is a computer model that helps design standalone electric power systems.  You give it information about electrical loads, renewable resources, and component costs, and HOMER designs the optimal power system to serve those loads.  The newest version of HOMER, v2.0, expands the utility of HOMER beyond the off-grid market into the grid connect distributed generation market.  
HOMER identifies the lowest-cost system for particular applications by simulating the hourly performance of a number of systems and ranking them by net present cost.  It can explore combinations of renewable energy technologies and by using sensitivity analysis determine the optimal economic, least-cost design.  HOMER can also compare stand alone vs. grid connect systems.

To date, 2270 people have downloaded HOMER in 135 countries.  Some of the organizations currently using HOMER are: Cagayan Electric Power & Light Co, Northern Power Systems, International Centre for Application of Solar Energy (CASE)
Perth, WA, Australia, and ÅF-Industriteknik AB, Sweden.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, Human Resources Directorate, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is seeking potential sources to develop additional capabilities for its  Human Resources Integrated Database (HR IDB) or to provide existing software  tools that would provide these capabilities.  Capabilities required include  comprehensive organization charts and "management level" tools and reports that  become an integral part of and use the data stored in the HR IDB, a web-based  application currently using ORACLE and Microsoft .NET. 	a.  The organization charts must encompass a variety of options to  include, but not necessarily limited to:  basic wiring diagrams, comprehensive  listings showing people and positions in each organization and its  subordinates, and summary counts of faces and spaces by officer, enlisted, and  civilians at the various organizational levels for both current and planned  organizational structures.  See attached examples. 	b.  Management level tools involve development of standard, easy to  understand, reports and analysis tools that allow managers at various levels to  see organizational demographics in summary form (e.g., pie/bar charts, tables,  etc.) at the touch of a button, as well as the capability to drill down to more  detailed data in the various categories. The Air Force anticipates eventually conducting a competitive acquisition for  this award.  Any development effort is required to be completed by September  2004. All interested firms shall submit a written explanation of their existing  software tool or similar past development work that demonstrates the capability  to produce said organization charts and/or management level tools within the  necessary timeframe.  These descriptions must be received NLT 30 Sep 2003 and  should include a rough cost estimate or not-to-exceed cost.  The Air Force  anticipates $100,000 to $400,000 possibly being made available for this effort  in FY04.  Where possible, the Air Force will request a demo of the contractor’s  product.   SEND ALL ENTRIES AND INQUIRIES TO: Jennifer Spoores, 2Lt  Bldg 11A  1970 Monahan Way WPAFB OH  45433-7208 E-mail: Jennifer.Spoores@wpafb.af.mil.   Phone:  937-255-4408 Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small  business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman-owned  business.  All interested firms shall submit information demonstrating their  capabilities to perform the work herein described.  The general definition of a  small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant  in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and  with its affiliates, and does not have annual receipts exceeding $18.0M.  The  Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon  responses hereto.  Small business respondents should provide a statement of  capabilities to assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.   Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign- owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national  employees on this effort. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is  voluntary.  The Air Force does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Air Force  for any purpose.

This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Answer questions. The due date for receipt of offers has already been extended to 9/23/2003. Question:  The RFQ specifies 1x10-8 cubic inches of helium per hour which equates to 4.56x10-11 SCCS Helium (approximately 44 times better). This number is beyond customary standards for a process chamber of this type.	Could you please confirm if this leak rate is correct. Answer:  The leak rate specification will be changed to 2x10-9 std cc/sec of Helium.  This standard for UHV process chambers is acceptable for our requirements

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO RESPOND TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

QUESTION:

In your requirements, you are requesting a horizontal clearance of approximately 32 in.  My question is, will the tire be placed at the bottom of the test frame in its entirety.   Is it possible to place only a portion of the tire in the test frame during the test? Are there any test specifications you can forward to me, detailing the methods of your proposed testing?  

ANSWER:

The requirements for bicycles can be found in 16 CFR 1512 and the test manual for bicycles is available on the CPSC web site.  the rim test in section 5.12 applies a 2,000 n (450 lbf) load to the hub of the wheel with the tire supported fully by a “mask.”  As envisioned for the purpose of specifying this equipment, the tire shall be placed at the bottom of the test frame in its entirety.

The project officer can not answer the second part of question (is it possible to place only a portion of the tire in the test frame during the test?)  without seeing specific details on how the vendor proposes to meet the testing requirement outlined in 16 CFR 1512.

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Rose Heidenreich, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed above.  The quotation package is due August 18, 2003, No change in response date. All responsible sources may submit their written offers by fax or e-mail to Rose Heidenreich at the address listed above,  Facsimile No. (30l) 504-0628, or  e-mail to rheidenreich@cpsc.gov

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to deliver the National Highway Institute’s (NHI) existing course #134057, “Transportation Asset Management.” Transportation Asset Management is a strategic approach to managing physical transportation infrastructure. The course presents issues and recommended practices for a systematic process of preserving, upgrading and operating physical assets cost effectively. It combines engineering principles with sound business practices and economic theory, and provides tools to facilitate a more organized, logical approach to decision-making. This introductory one-day training course is targeted to the executive, top and mid management levels of a state Department of Transportation.

The resulting contract will be for two years, with three 1-year options to address continuing requirements.

This is a full and open Commercial Item solicitation being conducted under FAR Part 12 procedures. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

For the purpose of assisting those companies interested in this new training effort, we are taking two preliminary steps. First, we will quickly post a DRAFT of key sections of the proposed RFP. This is strictly for your information, and may be altered in any way prior to the official release of the RFP. Offerors are cautioned to use this only for planning purposes, and to read the actual RFP carefully when it is released.

Secondly, we are planning to hold a preproposal conference for interested companies at the NHI offices in Ballston, Virginia on May 22nd. The conference will be lead by the Contracting Officer and the Program Manager to both provide an overview of the RFP and resulting contract, and to answer your questions. We will have representatives of our Asset Management Office in attendance to explain the program and its goals.

 Inasmuch as our space is limited, we may need to have more than one session. In order to avoid having to turn people away, you MUST preregister for the conference. We will acknowledge your registration request, provide you with the specific location and assign you a time. Anyone who just shows up without having received an acknowledgement and time assignment should expect to be turned away.

To register for the conference, send an e-mail to Bob.Prior@fhwa.dot.gov. Please state the number of people who will be attending. Again, due to limited space, please send as few as necessary to meet your needs.

We will track the questions and answers from the conference(s) and post them here on FedBizOpps for the benefit of all.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. However, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements and notifications of postings by e-mail.

Please note that FedBizOpps has added a new feature called Interested Vendors List. Those interested in subcontracting, supplying, consulting and the like should register, and prime contractors should review the names posted there.

Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is May 23, 2003. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation, Short-Term Lending Program offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate. For further information, call (800) 532-1169. Internet address: http://osdbuweb.dot.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to: 1.	Response to questions received.  See attached pages. and 2. The new due date is September 22, 2003 at 1:00PM local time.Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the document referenced in Item 9A or 10A, as heretofore changed, remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

The following questions have been received and responses are provided as follows:

1.  Question:  Could you please confirm if the following AMS's have been complied with on your MGB's for the a/c you would like to have converted?  AMS 7111, 7114 and 6114 are already applied.

Response:  AMS 07-7114 and 07-7111:  modifications have been incorporated.  07- 6114: It has been incorporated but we do not have P/N 350A37-1228-23 droop yokes installed.  We have P/N 350A37-1162-00 yokes installed.

2.  Question:  Could someone confirm if theses AMS have already been applied?
If the a/c was manufactured in 1987 or earlier, we need to know if the following AMS are applied:
07- 0498,  0900, 1156, 1447, 1323, 1580, 1591, 1616, 1678, 1713, 1721, 1740, 6175,     6523, 6529, 6535, 9025, and  9537.  Most of them should be recorded on the A/C log and RIC AMS.

Response:  All are installed except 1580 and 6175 (which is not required due to the environment we operate in  Del Rio, TX)

 3.  Question:  07-1580: Do you have the load compensator 355A75-1370-03 installed or not? (should be if  07-1591 is installed).

Response:  None of the BA helicopters have the load compensator installed.

4.  Question:  07-6175 Spherical thrust bearing: what P/N is installed on your aircraft?

Response:  Helicopter N840BP has spherical thrust bearing P/N 704A33-633-10951, N841BP, N842BP & N843BP have spherical thrust bearing P/N 704A33-633-21151 installed.

5.  Question:  07-6174 Main rotor anti vibration springs: Do you have the new spring 704A33-641-004 or -005 installed.

Response:  In regards to 07-6174 main rotor anti-vibrator springs. All of the BA helicopters have P/N 704A33-641-002 spings installed. They have not been replaced since we have had the helicopters, so they are probably all originals.

6.  Question:  Also for the MGB:  Additional Kit 350ABAENB2MECA will be necessary if the MGB does not have already the following AMS applied:
    1. 07-7114 AS355 reinforced epicyclic SB 63-00-03. Epicyclic P/N 350A32-0100-10 or 350A32-110-00 is needed,
    2. 07-7111 New epicyclic oil jet SB 63-00-03.
    3. 07-6144 Main rotor drop ring chamfered stirrups SB25-00-06 P/N 350A37-1228-23 needed.	

Response:  The following information is provided:

1.	AMS 07-7114:  Main Gearbox (installation of reinforced epicyclic gear) SB 63-03 under AMS 07-7114 states Note: epicyclic reduction gear P/N 350A32-0110-00 is fitted with a planet gear cage P/N 350A32-1089-20 or -21.  All AS350BA aircraft are fitted with epicyclic reduction gear  P/N 350A32-0110-00 and planet gear cage P/N 350A32-1089-21.  Note: The hard cards for the bevel reduction gear and for the epicyclic reduction gear do not specifically state having modification 07-7114 incorporated, but after reading SB 63-03 we believe it would have to be incorporated.

2.	AMS 07-7111  Main Gearbox (new forward jet for reinforced epicyclic) SB 63-03 states  Note: bevel reduction gear P/N 350A32-0300-04 is fitted with an oil jet subject of modification AMS 350A07-7111.  All AS350BA aircraft are fitted with reduction bevel gear P/N 350A32-0300-04.  Note: The hard cards for the bevel reduction gear and for the epicyclic reduction gear do not specifically state having modification 07-7111 incorporated, but after reading SB 63-03 we believe it would have to be incorporated.

3.  AMS 07-6114	  Main Rotor Hub (bonding of Du bushes) SB-65-29a  dated June 27, 1983 discusses modification of Starflex P/N 350A31-1901-01 by changing to new type of Du bush bonding, the Starflex P/N changes to 350A31-1901-02 after incorporation.
N840BP		Serial # 2035	has Starflex P/N 350A31-1916-00
N841BP		Serial # 2036	has Starflex P/N 350A31-1916-00
N842BP		Serial # 2037	has Starflex P/N 350A31-1907-03
N843BP		Serial # 2046	has Starflex P/N 350A31-1916-00

Note: There are no hard cards for the Starflex that would list specific modifications. Since AMS 07-6114 is referring to earlier part number Starflex assemblies we would think our later part number Starflex's have been modified.

The delivery and inspection/acceptance point is 908th Airlift Wing - Attn: Cathy Britt, 225 West Ash St. (Bldg 845), Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6501.            Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  The lowest priced offeror will be notified and must supply (to the delivery and inspection/acceptance point) 4 samples of their previous, similar work that may or may not be one or more of the CLINs identified above within 3 business days of notification, at no cost to the government.  If the sample is not technically acceptable, the next lowest offeror will be notified.  This process will be repeated until a technically acceptable sample is received.  All samples will be kept on file for documentation purposes and the government will not be obligated to purchase or return the samples.  Upon issuance of the purchase order and not later than 45 days after receipt of award, the contractor will provide to the government a preproduction sample set of 10 for each CLIN.  The preproduction samples shall be of the same or higher quality as the original 4 samples of work.  Each preproduction sample for each CLIN will be evaluated by the government (at the delivery and inspection/acceptance point) and any deficiencies will be noted to the contractor.  The contractor shall have 10 days to correct any deficiencies identified by the contracting officer and produce a new preproduction sample.  Once all preproduction samples are determined to be technically acceptable, the sample sets are considered delivered to, inspected by, and accepted by the government.  The contractor shall then produce the remainder of the order, delivering all patches to the delivery and inspection/acceptance point not later than 90 days after receipt of award.  All patches shall be inspected against the approved preproduction sample set prior to acceptance.  If any patches are determined to be of lesser quality than the preproduction sample set, the government will identify the CLIN and the quantity to the contractor that have been delivered but not accepted.  The contractor shall replace the unaccepted patches at no cost to the government.  Therefore, if the contractor requires the return of the unaccepted patches, the contractor must provide prepaid shipping for the unacceptable patches.            This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

The lowest priced offeror will be notified and must supply (to the delivery and inspection/acceptance point) 4 samples of their previous, similar work that may or may not be one or more of the CLINs identified above within 3 business days of notification, at no cost to the government.  If the sample is not technically acceptable, the next lowest offeror will be notified.  This process will be repeated until a technically acceptable sample is received.  All samples will be kept on file for documentation purposes and the government will not be obligated to purchase or return the samples.  Upon issuance of the purchase order and not later than 45 days after receipt of award, the contractor will provide to the government a preproduction sample set of 10 for each CLIN.

The contractor shall have 10 days to correct any deficiencies identified by the contracting officer and produce a new preproduction sample.  Once all preproduction samples are determined to be technically acceptable, the sample sets are considered delivered to, inspected by, and accepted by the government.  The contractor shall then produce the remainder of the order, delivering all patches to the delivery and inspection/acceptance point not later than 90 days after receipt of award.

If any patches are determined to be of lesser quality than the preproduction sample set, the government will identify the CLIN and the quantity to the contractor that have been delivered but not accepted.

<DESC>This modification is issued to answer questions received in response to Solicitation USSS030047 as follows:  1.Q.:  [Regarding the above referenced Solicitation's reference to a "Cisco 2905 10/100/1000 24 port switch", Cisco does not carry a model 2905.  However, it is assumed that you are actually looking for a model 2950 switch.  There are two choices with "10/100/1000" interfaces:  Catalyst 2950T or Catalyst 2950SX.  Please advise which switch interface (100Base T or 100Base-SX) is required for the configuration.]  A:  The 100Base T or 2950T is required.  2.Q.:  The requirement for 10 Terabytes requires more rackmount units (RU) than currently allotted per the other requirements (switch, server, fan, etc) - is the intent to only have a single 15RU Hardigg case for each of the three mobile units or will multiple cases for each of the three mobile solutions be acceptable?  A:  One (1) 15RU Hardigg case is required for each system.  3.Q.:  There are alternatives to the 3RU cooling fan which includes mounting a fan to the back of the case - will this type of a solution be acceptable to the Secret Service?  A:  A different cooling fan is acceptable as long as it provides “adequate cooling.”  If you propose a different cooling fan, proof of ability to provide “adequate cooling” must be submitted with your proposal.  4.Q:  Can you please clarify the "11RU Powerstrip".  A:  The “11RU Powerstrip” requirement is a typo and is revised to read “1RU Powerstrip.”  5.Q:  Your Past Performance requirement includes reference to "supporting (the kits) in the field."  Is there an intent to procure additional on site support and service for these units?  A:  The support required would be for any downtime incurred due to malfunction of the system(s) during the warranty period.  It is expected that that support would be supplied within the confines of the offeror’s warranty at no additional cost to the government.  6.Q:  Will the cooling fans be attached to the front or back of the rack (if front, it will prohibit the use of 3U in the rack).  A:  There is no front and back, just two (2) fronts; the backs are in the middle.  7.Q:  How many ports does the KVM switch need to have?  A:  The KVM switch must have at least four (4) ports.  8.Q:  Manufacturer or alternative?; Model number for the mobile storage system?  Need specs on the processor, memory, hard drive (primary, secondary), bundled software, network interface card, adapters, and warranty requirement.  A:  This is not a commercial-of-the-shelf system.  The U.S. Secret Service does not have any further specifications or other information to provide other than what is contained in the synopsis.  The closing date and time for receipt of proposals is hereby extended to September 18, 2003, 2:00 PM Local Time.  This closing date and time is firm, and no other questions will be entertained.

dimensions of the container?

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management Information Systems Project Office is conducting a market survey seeking sources of existing commercial or government (COTS or GOTS) supply/material inventory management software applications that could be suitable for Forest Service (and cooperator agency) forest fire cache (warehouse) facilities.  

Current fire cache operations include the following business processes: defining customers and orders; creating requisitions, purchase orders and requests for supply items; issuing items; receiving new items; documenting work orders (e.g. item repair and refurbishment); back-ordering items; reserving items for future issue; documenting shipping status; returning items from incidents; maintaining an item catalog; determining warehouse location; disposing items; tracking accountable property items; building and tracking kits composed of individual items; identifying items with expiration dates (e.g. medical items and meals); designating critical items and producing a host of standard and user-defined (i.e. ad hoc) reports on demand. 

This inventory tool would be used by between 250 and 350 government personnel with knowledge of fire cache business operations.  General software architectural requirements would include: varying levels of user access and security would be controlled by a system administrator through profiles, passwords, etc.; must run as a stand alone Java application; able to communicate with central/dispersed servers; exactly meets or could easily be altered to accommodate existing legacy application processes and GUI user interfaces; able to be deployed quickly; easily learned by government personnel; is modularized for adaptation to different-sized operations and phased implementation; code is written in common commercially available development language which could be modified and maintained by gov’t employees or other vendors; system would allow data entry by various input technology (e.g. mouse, keyboard, barcode, smart card); able to interface with one or more existing stand-alone software applications though an API or other means.  

A copy of the IBCS legacy system reference guide can be accessed at the following URL: http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/planning/nist/icbs.htm. 

This is a  sources sought synopsis to identify prospective sources and does not commit the USDA Forest Service to issue a solicitation or make an award.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor the site for release of any future solicitation or synopsis. 

Offerors having an off-the-shelf application/system similar to that described above are invited to provide information regarding your system and company to the Contract Specialist, Joy Bartlett, at jlbartlett@fs.fed.us or fax number (303) 275-5453, no later than 4 P.M. MST, October XX, 2003.  

System information should include the general description of application business processes, operating environment, architecture description, software development code and version and current government or commercial use of system.  Company information shall include name of company, point of contact, business size and disadvantaged status, if any.  Offerors are invited to include an order of magnitude cost to the government estimate to procure the application, including any software licensing costs.  Any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought.

<DESC>The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Coordinating Center for Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS-II). The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees.   The objectives of REDS-II are to conduct epidemiological, laboratory, and survey research on volunteer blood donors to ensure the safety and availability of the Nation’s blood supply.  This includes monitoring known blood-borne infectious agents, evaluating the impact of emerging pathogens, assessing the safety implications of changes in laboratory and/or blood donor screening protocols, and examining blood supply and availability issues.  Issues to be addressed include:  a) risks of transfusion-transmissible infections and trends through time (i.e. infectious agents undergoing laboratory screening and new and emerging agents such as West Nile Virus); b) ways to reduce risks of transfusion-transmissible infections; c) HIV, HTLV, HCV, and HBV test screening methodologies; d) donor characteristics, behaviors, and donation return patterns; and e) effectiveness and safety of various strategies implemented to increase the blood supply.   The Coordinating Center will be expected to collect monthly donation data from  6-8 participating blood centers representing a minimum of between 170,000 and 220,000 donations annually from an estimated 120,000 to 160,000 donors.  During the course of the study, the Coordinating Center may also be expected to process survey forms for one or two major studies with an estimated 15,000 - 50,000 subjects each.  The mode of survey administration will depend upon the study design.  It is expected that the laboratory component of the study will generate about four studies annually for which the Coordinating Center will process, manage, and analyze data.  The REDS-II Coordinating Center will perform the following tasks: 1) Coordinate and participate in development and finalization of study protocols, manuals of operation, and design of study forms, in addition to reproduction, distribution, and update of protocols, manuals of operation and study forms. 2) Coordinate and arrange Steering Committee and other key meetings as necessary; prepare and distribute agenda, reports, and minutes. 3) Develop and implement data collection procedures for epidemiologic and survey studies; perform all activities of a coordinating center (collecting, organizing and storing for analysis data from blood centers including infectious disease marker data [screening and confirmatory data] and donor demographic data [age, race, gender, education, ethnicity, country of birth, history of transfusion] and study data from the central laboratory; monitor shipment of biological specimens from blood centers to the central laboratory); assure the quality of the study data submitted and stored; provide support and documentation for the OMB forms clearance process if necessary.  4) Train blood center staff in entry of data and completion of study forms.  5) Have primary responsibility to assure prompt accumulation, entry, and editing of study data (screening, baseline, periodic follow-up, special events); assume data will be collected from a minimum of between 120,000 and 160,000 blood donors per year.
6) Communicate with blood centers concerning missing, delayed, incomplete, or erroneous data.  7) Obtain and process laboratory test reports from the study’s central laboratory; coordinate compilation of data collected by central laboratory into a study database for subsequent statistical analysis; maintain a record of studies conducted, the number and types of samples used, and the results of analyses conducted by the central laboratory; compile and manage an inventory of specimens shipped and received by the central laboratory from the blood centers.  8) Prepare technical progress reports in order to monitor study progress, quality of data and blood center performance.  9) Interact with the Project Officer on issues relating to study design, study conduct, and data analysis.   10) Analyze all study data collected during REDS-II.  Analytic and statistical capabilities needed shall include not only descriptive epidemiological analyses, but categorical and longitudinal data analyses, multivariate regression models, and analysis capabilities specific to case control studies, cohort studies, and complex survey designs.  Analysis capabilities shall include the ability to model transfusion-transmitted risks using established models or by developing novel models and methods as necessary.  For laboratory studies, sensitivity and specificity analysis may be needed where there may not be a gold standard.  11) Complete analysis of final study data for delivery in SAS format.  12) Assist in preparation of scientific reports for publication and  presentation.  13) Develop, implement, and update an approved automated information system security plan.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-13 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and two copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 
1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience in the operation of a coordinating center for multi-center, multi-project epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory research in the areas of blood banking and transfusion medicine.  2) Design and conduct of multicenter surveys, and compilation of data sets using mail and web-based data collection methods; 3) Ready access to expertise in transfusion medicine and infectious disease; 4) Adequacy of organizational and administrative structure to participate in a multicenter epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory study; 5) Facilities and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above; and 6) The firm’s status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of five years with an approximate date of award August 31, 2004.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide information pertinent to the requirements mentioned above (original and three copies) within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

Sincerely,  Neil Kester, Supervisory Executive Officer.  POSITION INFORMATION: Issuance Date: September 18, 2003, Closing Date: October 2, 2003,
Market Value:  2003 GS-13 equivalent -- $61,251 - $79,629. 
Period of Performance: Two (2) years with two (2) option years. 
I. BACKGROUND: Starting in 1994, USAID/Honduras' Agriculture and Natural Resources Office (ANRO) employed a USPSC to assist with the implementation of its Policy Analysis and Implementation Project (PAIP) in the agricultural sector.  In 1995, the responsibilities for this position were expanded to include, in addition to agriculture sector policy issues, broader economic policy issues and closer involvement with the public and private sector organizations. As a result of this work, close working relationships were established with several key Honduran economic policy making institutions, such as the Minister of the Presidency's Policy Analysis Unit (UNAT), the Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce (SAG and SIC, respectively), the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Foundation for Investment and Development of Exports (FIDE), the Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP), and the Federation of Chambers of Industry and Commerce (FEDECAMARAS). The Mission’s 1998-2002 Strategic Plan included SO1 – “Expanded and Equitable Access to Productive Resources and Markets” to improve Honduran policies conducive to economic growth and poverty reduction, and to improve market access and competitiveness. The primary implementers are Chemonics International and its four subcontractors (IMCC, MSI, Austin Associates, FIDE), FINTRAC, Land O' Lakes, Carana Corporation, Accion International, Aid to Artisans, and Covelo Foundation. USAID´s new 2003-2008 Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy includes Strategic Objective (SO2) Economic Freedom: Open, Diversified and Expanding Economies.  This SO will address agricultural based market development and business development.  The program is expected to introduce more productive technology, build links between producers, agribusinesses and external markets and improve economic and trade policies which encourage investment and exports.  This new SO will include trade, diversification and integrated watershed management activities, as well as the Mission’s Food Security activities. The incumbent will be responsible for contributing to achievement of the following principal SO2 results:  -Increased trade, both intra-regional and total; - Greater contributions of especially higher value-added sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, services and “green products” to the economy; - New jobs and economic opportunities, leading to increased and more equitably  distributed incomes of the citizens of Central America and Mexico; and - Improved management of critical watersheds and natural resources.  There are direct and important links between agriculture, rural income, food security, watershed management, biodiversity, and disaster preparedness.  Honduras is highly susceptible to hurricanes and drought conditions. By introducing profitable agribusiness options and environmentally friendly technology, USAID/Honduras expects the pressure on Honduras fragile hillsides and protected areas to diminish. SO2 initiatives will increase small farmer access to modern technologies as alternatives to slash and burn agriculture, the principal deforestation cause in Honduras.  Honduras proved its ability to rebuild after Hurricane Mitch. It now has the opportunity to transform productive sectors in step with the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and the UN’s Millennium Development Agenda. Farmers produce an array of attractive tropical fruit and vegetables that do not compete with US producers.  There are also agricultural market linkages within the region, with Canada, Europe and Japan and opportunities for growth in wood manufacturing, light assembly and artisan products.
II. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION: The primary objectives of this USPSC position are: (i) to assist the Government of Honduras (GOH) and USAID/Honduras to identify and implement sound agricultural trade and agri-business investment policies, regulations and activities that will enhance Honduras´ competitiveness under the Central America Free Trade Agreement; (ii) to manage, coordinate, and monitor new agri-trade and agri-business investment activities required to achieve CAM´s SO2 results, in collaboration with other Strategic Objectives teams; and (iii) to advise the ANRO Director on agri-business matters.

The incumbent will fully engage USAID’s primary government counterparts (e.g., SIC, SAG, UNAT, BCH, INE, FIDE, COHEP) on SO2 agri-trade and agri-business investment policy and technology transfer work.  The incumbent shall play a lead role in technical discussions with public and private sector organizations, including, but not limited to, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) reports, Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations, Global Development Alliances opportunities, Honduran Foundation for Agricultural Research (FHIA), National Agricultural School (ENA), Panamerican Agricultural College (EAP, Zamorano) capabilities.  The Agricultural Development Specialist will liaise with other U.S. institutions, such as USDA and DOC.

<SUBJECT>18--NASA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) PROVISION OF CREW HABITABILITY EQUIPMENT FOR ISS
<DESC>PURPOSE:	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) International Space Station Program (ISSP) seeks information (listed in Part B below) from organizations that may be interested in collaborating with NASA to provide any or all of the Astronaut Crew Habitability Equipment described in Part A below for use onboard the International Space Station (ISS). This collaboration would be on a non-exclusive basis, with no appropriated government funds, and consistent with advertising restrictions (as described in Part C below).   It is expected that responses to this RFI will contain sufficient information about:  1) items the responder proposes to provide; 2) the capabilities of the respondent to provide these items; 3) the quid-pro-quos desired by the responder; and 4) the business plan of the provider for NASA, to determine if it is in the best interest of the Government and Private Industry to issue a “Request for Entrepreneurial Offers” (REO).  Such an REO would contain more detailed information on the specific items to be provided and the potential terms and conditions for any agreements to be concluded.  Responses to the REO could lead to one or more Space Act Agreements between NASA and the providing entity.   It is anticipated that any eventual arrangement between NASA and a provider of equipment will contain opportunities for the provider to receive and use identification with and recognition for its contributions to the ISS (consistent with the advertising restrictions contained in this RFI), as well as plans for activities in support of outreach and educational programs for NASA. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. Currently, no public funds have been or are anticipated to be appropriated to NASA for allocation to these public-private partnerships. The terms and conditions of any agreement or partnership are flexible in cases where there is significant private investment and a clear public benefit. Such flexibility includes but is not limited to negotiating part or all, of the marginal costs for NASA-provided resources and capabilities in the near term where there is strong potential that a particular commercial ISS activity will become self-sustaining or such an activity enhances the International Space Station.  General information on commercial use of the ISS, commercial accommodations, offer contents, and pricing are located at website:   http://commercial.hq.nasa.gov	.  Part A:  ISS Astronaut Crew Habitability Equipment Introduction In order for the crew of the ISS to increase from a size of 3 crew members to a size of 4 – 7 crew members, additional crew habitability equipment (CHE) is required onboard the ISS.  CHE includes:  Crew Quarters, Crew Galley, Wardroom Table, Waste and Hygiene Compartment, and Waste Collection System. These items are briefly described below.  All items will have operating lifetimes of 15 years.  It is expected that all items will fit within and utilize an International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) location.  The ISPR locations to be used may be located either in Node 3 or in the US Laboratory Destiny.  (Information about the dimensions and characteristics of an ISPR location is contained in Part D.)  The equipment will allow for periodic inspections, preventative or corrective maintenance, restoration to original performance, and replacement of components.  All items will be transported to the ISS using the Space Shuttle and must withstand the launch environments.   Crew Quarters The Crew Quarters (CQ) provides an enclosed space with isolation from the light and noise onboard the ISS.  It includes the following capabilities and items: circulating atmosphere, atmosphere temperature adjustability; lighting; restraints for the crew member, equipment and personal items; stowage; a work surface; electrical power for the use of a laptop and crew personal equipment; LAN accommodations for a laptop computer; interfaces for communication with the ISS communication system, including the caution and warning system; visual indications for emergency egress; and smoke detection.  Each CQ provides sufficient volume for the crew to don and doff clothing.  The CQ will provide radiation protection of at least a 25% reduction in effective organ dose (rem) in crew quarter over nominal shielding amounts.  It is anticipated that 4 units of CQ will be provided. Crew Galley The Galley provides facilities with capabilities to rehydrate, and heat food for a crew of 7.	The Galley subsystems consist of a Water Dispenser (WD), Oven(s), Trash Compactor (TC), Food Preparation Area (FPA), and limited storage.  The Galley water dispenser receives potable water from ISS Systems or Contingency Water Containers (CWC).  The Galley water dispenser provides for the injection (via an existing food package septum) of chilled, heated, or ambient potable water for the hydration of food and beverages.  The Galley oven(s) is capable of heating food for a crew of 7 to at least 150° F (66° C) within 30 minutes.  The Galley trash compactor provides for the compaction of wet and dry trash.  The Galley also provides a food/beverage restraint system for ISS food packages and food trays.	The Galley rack provides interface locations for standard and unique restraints and mobility aids.  It is expected a Galley will fit within and utilize an ISPR location.	The Galley contains a smoke detector and provides a port for an ISS portable fire extinguisher.	The surfaces of the Galley are accessible for cleaning and sanitation. Wardroom Table The Wardroom Table (WRT) provides a stable surface for eating, working and meeting for the crew members.  It includes features such as object and paper stabilization (through air flow or other means), foot and body restraints, ability to be stowed and assembled easily and quickly, and accommodations for up to 7 crew members to eat together.  The surface of the WRT is flat and continuous to provide for crew functions such as writing and using a laptop computer.  The WRT can accommodate food trays.	The WRT will be deployed in the aisle across the face of an ISPR location. Waste and Hygiene Compartment The W&HC is an integrated structure of no more than 2 adjoining ISPR locations, consisting of a crew hygiene station, a Waste Collection System (WCS) (described below) and interfaces for the Urine Monitoring System (UMS).  The W&HC’s primary functions are to provide an area for crew cleansing of hands, face and partial body, oral hygiene, personal grooming, and the collection and temporary stowage of human metabolic waste.  The W&HC also provides an eye wash area, access for Crew Health Care System (CHeCS) water sampling and stowage areas for W&HC consumables, soft-goods and trash generated during W&HC activities.  The WHC provides for crew privacy.  The WHC provides adequate volume for donning and doffing of clothing, as well as personal hygiene activities to be performed by the crew.	 Waste Collection System The Waste Collection System (WCS) collects, stores, and compacts fecal and personal hygiene wastes, including wipes, female hygiene items, emesis bags, and soiled garments.	The WCS will also collect and transport urine to the ISS urine processor.  All functions shall be provided while controlling odors and optimizing crew comfort.  There are many common functions with WCS capabilities designed for extended duration Space Shuttle flights that may provide a starting point for system designs.   Mockups and Qualification Units Training mockups and qualification units for each item will be required for delivery in addition to the flight units. Specifications and Requirements Detailed specifications and requirements exist for most of the equipment described above.	This information can provided upon request.   Scope and Stages  Responders may propose provision of any or all of the items described above.	Proposals involving only one or a subset of the items listed above are acceptable.  It is anticipated that implementation and commitment to proceed on any arrangement involving more than one of the items would occur on a staged basis with periodic decision gates to proceed to the next stage.	The first stage would start with Phase A-type design activities for one or more of the simplest items.  Upon successful completion of the first stage, approval may given to proceed to Phase B for those initial items and to begin Phase A for next item or items.  Decision gates would continue to be used until all items to be provided are through Phase B. PART B:  Business Offer Contents 1.    Description of Offer: a.

NASA imagery may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, service, or activity, or used in any manner that might mislead. 2.      NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the imagery. 3.    It is unlawful to falsely claim copyright or other rights in NASA imagery. 4.   NASA shall in no way be liable for any costs, expenses, claims, or demands arising out of the use of NASA imagery by a recipient or a recipient's distributees. 5.      NASA does not indemnify nor hold harmless users of NASA imagery, nor release such users from copyright infringement, nor grant exclusive use rights with respect to NASA imagery. 6.	 NASA imagery is not protected by copyright unless noted.  If copyrighted, permission should be obtained from the copyright owner prior to use.  If not copyrighted, NASA imagery may be reproduced and distributed without further permission from NASA. 7.	  If a recognizable person (e.g., an astronaut or other individual) appears in NASA imagery, use for commercial purposes may infringe that individual's personal right of privacy or publicity.  If that individual is not currently employed by the U.S. Government, permission should be obtained from that individual if the proposed use of the NASA material could be viewed as a commercial exploitation of that person.  Government ethics laws prevent current Federal employees from granting such permission.  However, if the intended use of NASA material is primarily for communicative purposes, i.e., books, newspapers, and magazines reporting facts of historical significance (constitutionally protected media uses), then such uses will generally be considered not to infringe such personal rights. 8.   Federal law precludes the use the of the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration" or the letters "NASA", or any combination, variation, or colorable imitation of those words or letters either alone or in combination with other words or letters, (1) as a firm or business name in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such firm or business has some connection with, endorsement of, or authorization from, NASA which does not, in fact, exist; or (2) in connection with any product or service being offered or made available to the public in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such product or service has the authorization, support, sponsorship, or endorsement of, or the development, use, or manufacture by or on behalf of NASA which does not, in fact, exist. 9.  Use of NASA graphic identifiers, particularly, the NASA insignia, sometimes referred to as the NASA "meatball": a.	    The manufacture and commercial sale of the NASA insignia as a separate and distinct device in the form of an emblem, patch, insignia, badge, decal, vinyl cal, cloth, metal, or other material which would preclude NASA's control over its use or application is prohibited. b.        No approval for use of the NASA insignia will be authorized when its use can be construed as an endorsement by NASA of a product or service. c. Items bearing the NASA insignia such as souvenirs, novelties, toys, models, clothing, and similar items (including items for sale through the NASA employees' nonappropriated fund activities) may be manufactured and sold only after the NASA insignia application has been submitted to, and approved by, the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs, or designee, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.  20546. d.	      Use of the NASA insignia for any other purpose than as prescribed herein is prohibited, except that the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs may authorize on a case-by-case basis the use of the NASA insignia for other purposes when the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs deems such use to be appropriate.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-01 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.  MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/  and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ . The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.    The current primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs is X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) and an X.75 international gateway provided by MCI.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient. NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for access to an alternative X.75 gateway under the bidder's control, preferably in the United States, or in another country if a domestic gateway is unavailable, that can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010. The current figures and percentages are:  (a) OUTGOING TRAFFIC:  356 messages per day, averaging 200k bytes in a range of 150k to 250k bytes and where X.25 represents 42% of the total; and (b) INCOMING TRAFFIC: 231 messages per day, averaging 123k bytes in a range of 73k to 173k bytes and where X.25 represents 80% of the total. All X.25 connections originate and terminate at a Government X.25 switch. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive messages internationally by X.25. International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide international communication services as follows:  (a) provide a dedicated X.25 line to Suitland, MD to allow for simultaneous transmitting and receiving over a minimum of 64 virtual circuits; (b) provide circuit status confirmation;  (c) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services  without any changes or modifications to the contract; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps on an RS-232C physical interface.  The USMCC can also accept speeds ranging from 9.6kbps through 64kbps on a V.35 or RS-232C physical interface;  (e) the X.25 protocol must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards;    (f) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (g) provide for a backup access to the vendor's network in the event of a failure of the dedicated line; and, (h) all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site except for the backup access sited in item (g). Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible: The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e.g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor on the presumption that the vendor has a communications agreement in place with the nation accommodating that site. (c) Responsive maintenance: Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours for the commencement of trouble resolution.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage. The communications service shall provide for automatic rerouting of messages within the network to eliminate single points of failure within the cloud. The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification. (d) Security: The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC and all inbound traffic is authenticated using parameters such as calling address, called address and call user data. (e) Other Considerations: The minimum transmission speed to the network must be 9.6 kbps; a service requirement above 56 kbps is not anticipated or required. The Contractor shall comply with the following reporting requirements during the installation phase of the work: the Contractor shall attend weekly telecoms with the participants and the customer(s); the Contractor shall attend a formal mid-point briefing to be given for NOAA; and the Contractor shall attend a final formal briefing that will be given by NOAA and in which the Contractor shall provide an annotated final report. This is a firm fixed price requirement.  The Contractor shall provide a firm fixed price for the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):  CLIN 0001 The Contractor shall provide x.25 Switching Services in accordance with the requirements stated above; CLIN 0002 Monthly Recurring Charge; and CLIN 0003 Nonrecurring Charge (One-Time Only).

MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Telex and fax messages are sent from the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) to various international SAR Points Of Contact (SPOCs) and U.S. Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs).  The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD. Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/   and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/.    NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for the acquisition of messaging services that provide the USMCC capabilities to send facsimile message and send and receive telex messages.   These services are anticipated to allow the USMCC to continue national and international fax and telex data communications at least until 2010. It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs and the RCCs is low and a data rate of not less than 9.6 kbps nor more than 56 kbps are adequate for the mission. The current average byte volume per fax and telex is as follows: we send about 3500 faxes per month [117 per day]; we send about 160 Telex messages per month [5 per day]; and, we receive about 50 telex messages per month [2 per day]. Sample telex and fax messages appear in Appendix 1. Countries requiring telex and fax are shown in Appendix 2.  The USMCC requires near real-time automatic delivery i.e. a delivery time not to exceed 15 minutes from the beginning of a transmission to its receipt. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive telex messages, and send fax messages over a X.25 connection or other vendor provided transport or the Internet between the USMCC and the contractor's network. The International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.
