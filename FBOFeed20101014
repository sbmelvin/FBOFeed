<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).  A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft.  It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program.  The CMWS program is satisfying the Armys requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems.  The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force.  It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivablity Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection.  Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles.  The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions.  <BR>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions.  The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE.  In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems.  Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile.  Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat.  If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD).  Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots.  If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers.  The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution.  Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction.  The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS.  The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number.  In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions.  <BR>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance.  In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the OEM.  Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTR FY12.  The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits.  B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3.  The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority.  B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location.  Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request.  The anticipated PBL contract will cover supply chain management of the B-Kit, and potentially the A-Kit, engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handing, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management.  Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT).  Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<BR>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership.  The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system).  This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five-year Fixed Price Incentive contract.  Estimated award date is NLT  2QTRFY11.  PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI).

Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

Approved sources are: Kollmorgen Corp (11384), DRS Sustainment (20418).  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING UNTIL APPROXIMATELY November 1, 2010.

On or about November 1, 2010 a solicitation for an Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC) for Naval Station Great Lakes Area of Responsibility (AOR) will be posted on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov).  The preponderance of the work is at the Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) - Crane, Indiana, and Naval Support Activity Millington, Tennessee.  However, other locations nationwide as deemed necessary may be included to meet workload requirements.  Historically, volumes, of work have been performed at various locations throughout the following states:  Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
 This procurement is 100% set-a side for competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms located in the contiguous United States.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 562910.  The Government's objective is to obtain services, including all labor, material, transportation, equipment, and supervision required to provide environmental services entailing a wide range of projects; such as, but not limited to: AST/UST removal and/or replacement; remediation and testing; asbestos, lead and mold abatement; facility decontamination and demolition; soil and groundwater sampling and remediation; site characterization and assessment; hazardous and environmental waste documentation, handling, treatment, and disposal; landfill maintenance and repair; unexploded ordinance removal and disposal; long term monitoring and operation and maintenance of remediation facilities; along with wetland and dredging operations.
  Offerors must have an established reputation (or, if newly organized, whose personnel have previously established a reputation in the field) that is regularly engaged in and that maintains a regular staff of employees with necessary certifications and licenses.  Such certifications and licenses include, but are not limited to the following: asbestos, lead, hazardous waste, environmental cleanup, health and safety, sampling and analysis, air monitoring, noise analysis, as well as geological, hydro-geological and environmental engineering design and oversight.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to have performed this work on previous projects. The solicitation will result in between three to five MAC awards.
  The preponderance of the work will be between $10,000 and $8,000,000.  The contract vehicle may have occasional projects ranging from $3.5 million to $8 million.  The contracts will be for a 12 month base year and potential four option years.  The estimated maximum value for all contracts is $40,000,000. Performance and payment bonds are required. All interested firms must have bonding capability of $8,000,000.

Proposers will be evaluated using the two-phase request for proposal procedures that result in awards based on best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government will request for proposals (RFP) from firms in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and Navy/Marine Corps Acquisition Guide for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing a Two-Phase selection procedure similar to the procedures located at FAR 36.3.
  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases.  

Phase I is the pre-qualification phase.  Phase I factors relate to the five year ID/IQ contract requirements for environmental services as listed above.  A minimum of five firms will be pre-qualified in Phase I and will participate and advance to Phase II technical solutions and price. The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:   Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, Factor 3  Contract Management.
  

In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a proposal addressing the following: Technical Approach  Task Order (0001), Task Order 0001 Project Approach, Task Order 0001 Team Organization and Experience, Task Order 0001 Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, Task Order 0001 Technical Approach Breakdown and Task Order 0001 Project Milestone Schedule.  Price proposals may include total price evaluation within the Governments published budget for award.  The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project.
  The remaining best value offerors selected will receive a Multiple Award Contract that will include a minimum guarantee of $1,000.  Should one or more of the MAC Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate that task order with only that offeror.

As the solicitation will be issued via the internet, all prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  All contractors are encouraged to attempt to download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the internet, if necessary.
  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD: The successful offerors awarded a MAC contract in Phase II will compete on future task orders.  Offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in the pre-proposal conferences or site visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.
 The task order statements of work may be written based on Government/Contractor team cooperative scoping of the work. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or lowest price technically acceptable. If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals, or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government.
  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.  Reference is made to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in CCR.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

For inquiries about the Phase I proposal, please contact Ms. Amy Franks, 847-688-2600 extension 415 or email amy.franks@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for gamma scintillation survey meter systems for evaluation and potential fielding to Navy end users.  The system shall consist of a control unit and gamma scintillation probe.  A carrying case shall be provided with each system.  Currently the Navy utilizes the IM-253 gamma scintillation survey meter family -- comprised of four separate models -- to perform required surveys.  For each of the IM-253 models, both the main control unit (count-rate meter) and gamma scintillation probe (Eberline model SPA-3) are no longer manufactured.  The Navy still has ample operational SPA-3 probes to utilize.  However, a new control unit is needed to interface with the current SPA-3 probe population and to extend the lifetime of the IM-253 suite of equipment.  Under this procurement 350 control units for Navy personnel radiation survey capabilities and 350 gamma scintillation probes, which will supplement the SPA-3 probe population, will be provided over a five (5) month period of performance.
This procurement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 334519 and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and award a firm fixed price purchase order.  The system is expected to be a commercial off-the-shelf item which has been modified to meet the requirements in the RFQ.  The RFQ will be issued and posted on FedBizOpps on or about 03 May 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis under statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Far 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements, a contract with the University of Pennsylvania. The Volpe Center is supporting the Federal Aviation Administration with "Research and Analysis of FAA Noise Tools Ability to Support the Prediction of Noise From Commercial Jet Aircraft during Mission Segments En-route."</p>
<p>The Volpe Center is procuring research and analysis focusing on identifying the capabilities in the FAA noise tools that will support the prediction of noise from commercial jet aircraft during mission segments en-route, as well as identifying the gaps in this capability. This procurement requires the evaluation of Penn State University's (PSU) Hybrid Propagation Model (HPM), which is identified by the FAA's PARTnership in Noise and Emissions Reduction (PARTNER) /Center of Excellence (COE) program, as one of the best available models in terms of altitude dependent meteorological effects on noise levels from high-altitude aircraft. The HPM was develop by PSU in State College, PA and remains proprietary to PSU. To provide this analysis the Volpe Center requires the contactor to 1. Evaluate the capabilities of existing noise propagation models to accurately account for long distance noise propagation from en-route aircraft operations 2. Assess the need for additional en-route aircraft operations data 3. Develop recommendations for a long distance noise propagation modeling methodology that includes the effects of altitude dependent meteorology and is compatible with Integrated Noise Model and Aviation Environmental Design Tool databases for the estimation of en-route noise. To assess the capabilities of FAA noise tools to assess long range noise propagation and the proposal of modifications to the FAA model to account for altitude dependent meteorological effects on noise levels from high-altitude aircraft it is necessary for the contractor to have access to PSU's HPM. The applicable North American Industry Classification System code for this requirement is 54171. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Interested firms must submit in writing, no later than November 1, 2010, to the above named point of contact, a maximum of three pages addressing their ability as contractor to access the rights to utilize PSU's HPM.<br /><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS. <br />All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Cathryn Oliva-Simmons, at e-mail address cathryn.oliva.simmons@dot.gov, or mailing address J.A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Acquisition Division (RVP-31), 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142, no later than 2PM ET, November 1, 2010. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>

This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS). A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information. Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft. It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program. The CMWS program is satisfying the Armys requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems. The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force. It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection. Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles. The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions. <BR><BR>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions. The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE. In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems. Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile. Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat. If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD). Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots. If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers. The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution. Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction. The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS. The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number. In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions. <BR><BR>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance. In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the OEM. Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTR FY12. The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits. B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3. The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority. B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location. Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request. The anticipated PBL contract will cover supply chain management of the B-Kit, and potentially the A-Kit, engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handing, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management. Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT). Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<BR><BR>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers. Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited. This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein. If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership. The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system). This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider. The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR><BR>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five-year Fixed Price Incentive contract. Estimated award date is NLT 2QTRFY11. PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI). PSP Partnerships (in addition to a required Commercial Services Agreement with TYAD) are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for product support is identified. This office plans to transition management of select A-Kit materials to DLA. PM IRCM intends for the commercial PSP to partner with DLA through a non-binding partnering agreement to manage those items IAW FAR Part 51. <BR><BR>RESPONSES: Responses will be a 3 step process.

Interested firms shall provide completed qualification statements. Qualification Statements submitted in response to this notice must be received no later than 2pm Central Time, November 16, 2010, and will be used to determine the most highly qualified A-E firm. The selected A-E firm will then be asked to propose various rates for the eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Individual projects under the IDIQ contract will be negotiated and awarded on separate delivery orders issued after a firm fixed-price is agreed to by both parties based on various applicable rates in the basic IDIQ contract.

Required A-E Services
The resultant A-E Services IDIQ contract will include, but is not be limited to the following A-E Services: 

1.	Feasibility Studies 
2.	Housing Studies 
3.	Environmental Assessments
4.	Facilities Conditions Assessment
5.	Program Development for Facilities Studies 
6.	Budget Estimating Analysis
7.	Building Code Review to include Fire Protection (NFPA, IBC)
8.	Design reviews by various disciplines (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, civil, etc.).

About the Resultant Contract
The dollar range estimated for most projects and studies that would be awarded under the resultant IDIQ contract is between $5,000 and $125,000.  However, actual project workload is unknown at this time, and higher or lower dollar value projects are possible. There will be no guarantee as to the exact dollar amount of the projects to be awarded under any resultant A-E Services IDIQ contract.

The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates to be used to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects and be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Governments discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single A-E firm under this IDIQ requirement.
Overhead and hourly rates for the base year and all option years will be negotiated prior to the contract award. A formal audit of the proposed contractors records may be conducted to establish a reasonable base rate and professional man-hour rates.  

The minimum/maximum delivery order amount will be $2,500/$1,000,000. The resultant contract will be for an initial performance period of 365 days from the date of contract award.  Four additional one-year performance periods are contemplated as options that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government based on the contractors performance and the Governments needs. The volume of projects placed under the contract will, in part, be determined on the awardees ongoing contract performance record.

<DESC><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, whether they are: small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The U.S. Dept of Health and Human Service, Office of the Secretary, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is seeking sources which are capable of providing the services described below.</p>
<p>The purpose of any potential contract related to this sources sought will be to provide a mechanism for reimbursing providers of medical care provided to patients who were evacuated from Haiti to the U.S. after the January 12, 2010 earthquake. The current policy projection is to process claims for care delivered to qualifying patients between January 12, 2010 and November 1, 2010. The current claims submission cutoff date is expected to be March 31, 2011 for eligible dates of service through November 1, 2010. This cutoff date could be moved to an earlier date as a result of policy change.</p>
<p>The contractor shall independently, and not as an agent of the government, furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the government, to develop and administer a claim-based reimbursement program for medical care provided by qualified providers, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the Medicaid program guidelines in the state that medical care was provided in. Currently, we know of patients in five states (NY, GA, FL, TX, NC?), with the majority of patients in FL and GA. It is expected that more patients will turn up in other states, so any interested vendors should demonstrate a capability to adjudicate claims in not only GA and FL, but also have the ability to determine the Medicaid rates in other CONUS states.</p>
<p>In addition to adjudicating the provider claims, the government is contemplating charging the contractor with the task of reimbursing the providers. Due to FAR regulations, the expectation will be that the vendor will first pay the provider after getting approval from a government official to do so, and then the government will reimburse the vendor for payments made to the provider through monthly invoices. Any firms responding to this sources sought should provide information on whether or not they are capable of making such payments (likely to be several millions of dollars).</p>
<p>While it is difficult to project with absolute certainty the volume of claims expected to be filed for reimbursement, the contractor should assume a maximum volume of 10,000 claims.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Interested vendors must submit information regarding the respondents': (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training, specifically related to the requirement; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government and private contracts and references, and other related information that provides evidence of the respondent's capability and experience. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above and provide evidence that the vendor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall be limited to 20 pages, and must include, in addition to the firms capabilities:<br />(1) Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.<br />(2) Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.<br />(3) Business size for NAICS 524292 (size standard $7 million) and status, if qualified, as a small business. Businesses claming 8(a) or HUBZone qualifications must be certified by SBA. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages.<br />(4) DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential source.<br />(5) Identification of any potential GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are requested as well.</p>
<p>Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3, above).</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.</p>
<p>This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted because of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be received by the Contract Specialist named below, by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard time on October 20, 2010, for consideration. Responses to this notice must be submitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to the Contract Specialist, with the "ASPR-SUPP-2011" in the subject of the email.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and ASPR may contact one or more respondents for clarifications and to enhance the Government's understanding. This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.</p>

<a href="mailto:anna.garcia@usmc.mil">anna.garcia@usmc.mil</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Training Systems intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302 and 603-1 a)(2)(ii) FAAC, Inc, 1229 Oak Valley Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48108.  The MTVR-TS legacy systems upgrade at the school houses located at Camp Johnson, NC and Ft Leonard Wood, MO.  In an effort to expand the training capabilities of the MTVR ODS and to establish a common baseline amongst all Operator Driving Simulators (ODS), the United States Marine Corps (USMC) formal schoolhouses located in Camp Johnson, NC and Ft. Leonard Wood, MO require replacement of the current standard vehicle cabs with reconfigurable vehicle cabs.  The reconfigurable vehicle cabs shall allow the schoolhouses to provide simulation of HMMWV and all MRAP variant's for operator/driver training in addition to the current MTVR simulation capability.
  The reconfigurable vehicle cab upgrade will bring the MTVR ODS configuration in line with the USMC ODS configuration.  FAAC, Inc is the manufacturer of the legacy MTVR-TS system and their associated software.  The sole source contract will be a fixed priced contract with an estimated value of $5,272,000.

The scope of this effort is to expand the training capabilities of the MTVR ODS and to establish a common baseline amongst the ODS located in the formal schoolhouses at Camp Johnson, NC and Ft. Leonard Wood, MO by replacing the current vehicle cabs with reconfigurable vehicle cabs.  The reconfigurable vehicle cabs shall allow the schoolhouses to provide HMMWV and MRAP operator/driver training in addition to the current MTVR capability.
  The reconfigurable vehicle cab upgrade will be compatible with the current software and programmatic baseline without modifying the existing ODS system.  Only hardware modifications and changes will be made under this effort, no software changes. Hardware changes shall include, but will not be limited to, reconfigurable vehicle cabs, interchangeable faux armor panels to replicate vehicles lines of sight, and vehicle specific dash panels and steering wheels.   The reconfigurable vehicle cab upgrade will bring the MTVR ODS configuration in line with the USMC ODS configuration.  In all configurations, the fidelity of the ODS shall provide student operators with immersive and realistic experiences in operating the selected vehicle during both on/off road, and differing degrees of weather conditions scenarios.
 This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world military operations.

PM TRASYS requires that the FAAC-developed MTVR ODS hardware and software packages be upgraded to USMC ODS configuration.  FAAC, Inc will upgrade the MTVR-TS legacy systems currently in use at the schoolhouses located in Camp Johnson, NC and Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo.(comprised of 36 student training stations) which can only simulate the MTVR and MTVR-MAS vehicle. This upgrade will allow for all Marine Corps MTVR and ODS simulators to replicate all of the current tactical wheel vehicles.  This effort consolidates all Marine Corps ODS(s) to one baseline and configuration for program and sustainment cost savings.
  Additionally, this effort leverages off of ~$25 million in sunken costs of supplies and equipment in the MTVR-TS program that would be lost if not Sole Source approved.  The MTVR ODS vehicle cab and associated dash/steering hardware will be replaced at Camp Johnson, NC and Ft. Leonard Wood, MO with modular vehicle cabs and associated dash/steering hardware that replicate the look, feel and operating characteristics of the MTVR, MTVR MAS, HMMWV, and MRAP Cougar. In addition, new hardware shall operate and function with the remaining legacy hardware and software without conflict. This will also allow the addition of the future tactical wheeled vehicles; the M-ATV and the JLTV to be added, at one time, to all simulator systems, Marine Corps wide.
 The M-ATV is currently being fielded to active duty forces and no simulator training is currently available.

The proposed contract action is for services and end items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 2 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Each response received will be used at the sole discretion of the Government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. 

All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to anna.garcia@usmc.mil. Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses. The point of the contact for this announcement is Anna Garcia, Contracting Specialist.

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 28, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<CONTACT>Joan M Fitts, Phone 202-707-0407, Fax 202-707-0485, Email jfitts@loc.gov
<DESC>The Library of Congress (Library) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the HathiTrust, managed by the University of Michigan, a non-profit educational organization located in Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109.
<p>To support its research community and collection development activities in the digital arena, the Library requires participation in a digital repository that aggregates the Library of Congress' digital collections with the digital content of the nation's other largest research libraries. The digital repository must use high quality metadata created and implemented according to accepted library preservation standards (for example, PREMIS), providing researchers the powerful, multifaceted discovery and analysis capabilities they need when accessing digital content. The Library also requires that the digital repository provide long-term storage and maintenance of the Library's digital materials as well as the digital collections of the nation's largest research libraries in perpetuity at the lowest possible cost and with the public good as the primary intent.</p>
<p>A digital repository storing Library materials must have the capacity to maintain its collections over the long-term, conforming to established digital preservation and audit standards, guidelines, and best practices such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, the Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), the Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) framework, and the Trustworthy Repositories Audit &amp; Certification (TRAC). HathiTrust is the only established service that conforms to these standards and provides the aforementioned access, discovery, and analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>The Library seeks to join a cooperative public interest venture to support the American research library community in its effort to establish and develop a sustainable digital book preservation repository. As a member of the HathiTrust consortium, the Library will be positioned to encourage the growth and development of Hathi and successor entities as repositories of the nation's digital heritage. Through the participation with the HathiTrust consortium, the Library will contribute to the development of the project and can be represented in key governance bodies. The Library's involvement will support the mission of the Library and that of HathiTrust, which serves the Library as well as many of the nation's major educational institutions.</p>
<p>Response to this notice must include&nbsp;technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates&nbsp;ability to meet the Library of Congress requirements.&nbsp; Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the Contracting Officer as specified.</p>
<p>This synopsis is NOT to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded based on offers received in response to this notice. Responses will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first purpose of this Modification 40 is to obligate $135,000 in new funding to Option Period 2 in support of Work Assignment 2-101. The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-101 is from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-101 is $373,047.17.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second purpose of this Modification 40 is to obligate $257,094 in new funding to Option Period 2 in support of Work Assignment 2-103. The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-103 is from January 4, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-103 is $907,094.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-101, requires support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br />&bull; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA. <br />&bull; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.<br />&bull; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&bull; Prepare a report on each waiver. <br />&bull; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-103, the contractor shall provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

METHOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: The NECO website has a "submit bid" button next to the solicitation number.  DO NOT use the "submit bid" button on NECO to submit your proposal. Offers MUST be submitted by fax to 207-438-1251. 

Evaluation of Quotes - Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance.
 Options will be inclusive in the evaluation. Options will not be exercised at time of award. 
The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the performance work statement/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either: 
1) all such contracts within the past three years, or

The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.
 The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

Performance Work Statement (PWS) Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Suite of Applications Help Desk Support Services

1.0 Introduction:  The Navy Supply Information Systems Activity (NAVSISA) is the Information Technology (IT) support provider for the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP).  NAVSISA requires continuing NetWeave interface software support that underpins the connectivity between the Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Suite of Applications; which includes the following systems:  Naval Aviation Logistics Command/Management Information System (NALCOMIS); Force Inventory Management Analysis Reporting System (FIMARS); Centralized Point of Entry Network/Virtual Master Stock Item Record (CPEN/VMSIR); and Real-time Reutilization Asset Management (RRAM).
  This TAV Suite of Applications uses Government off-the-shelf and Commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS-COTS) Navy developed interface software to communicate.  Full support of the NetWeave interface software, including testing, routine maintenance, and deficiencies and enhancements to support NALCOMIS, FIMARS, CPEN/VMSIR and RRAM is required. 

2.0 Background:  The Navy established a goal of attaining visibility and accessibility of all unclassified assets held by all claimants in accordance with mutually agreed upon set of business rules.  TAV increases lateral redistribution of assets, increases efficient use of assets, decreases procurement and repair investment costs, reduces duplication of inventory, performs better planning and more informed decisions.
  Communications between the TAV Suite of Applications is attained by utilizing broad-based middleware (NetWeave) GOTS-COTS interface software that allows users to interconnect their otherwise incompatible legacy computer systems and to open them up to modern technologies of workstations, LANs, and SQL servers. This software was designed specifically to support the high performance, scalability, reliability, and data integrity needs of mission-critical, distributed applications.  The vendor supported middleware (NetWeave) serves as the glue, which binds diverse computer systems that were not designed to communicate with each other, into a seamless application network.

    2.1 Requiring Organization:

        Navy Supply Information Systems Activity (NAVSISA)
        Code 9241

    2.2 Project Description:  Navy Supply Information Systems Activity (NAVSISA) is the Central Design Agency for NALCOMIS, FIMARS, CPEN/VMSIR and RRAM, which rely heavily on NetWeave software support.
  A complete spectrum of activities from preparing functional and environmental requirements documents, trouble shooting, analyzing, fixing, testing, problem resolution and mentoring.

3.0 Scope:  This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to acquire contractor Information Technology (IT) maintenance and production support of the NetWeave software for the suite of TAV Applications.  This includes a complete spectrum of activities from preparing functional and environmental requirements documents, trouble shooting, testing and support to meet standard solutions as provided.  It will be in compliance with DoD regulation force at the time the solution is made and installed.

SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010) 

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.
  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.  
  
The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.
  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract.
 The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  

Non-Sensitive Positions
Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: 

	Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and 
	Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.
  

To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractors Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: 

	SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions
	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
	Original Signed Release Statements

The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI.  

The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  
 
Sensitive Positions 
Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.
  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:

	SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
	Original Signed Release Statements 

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.

IT Systems Access
When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 
     
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  

Security Approval Process
The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.

If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract.
 

The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  

The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.
(End of Clause)

<DESC>USAID/East Africa is located in Nairobi, Kenya and is part of the USAID Nairobi complex of USAID/Kenya, USAID/East Africa and several other USAID operating units. <br />The USAID Nairobi complex is a training site for Development Leadership Initiative (DLI) junior officers who are on their first tour overseas for the Agency. USAID/East Africa has also been selected as pilot for a Local Capacity Development (LCD) Team. This solicitation seek candidates who can serve both as DLI Coordinator for the USAID Nairobi complex and Local Capacity Development Team Leader for USAID/East Africa. <br />DLI Coordinator. Thus far, 17 DLIs have been assigned to the USAID Nairobi complex and approximately 25 more will be deployed during fiscal years 2011- 2012, with 20 DLIs assigned at any given time, on a rotating basis. The normal tour for a DLI is two years, in which the DLIs work in different offices of USAID, each typically for a period of three months. <br />The DLI training and mentoring program at the Nairobi complex requires dedicated coordination and support to ensure that training plans are developed in light of regional and other training opportunities; that an effective mentorship program is implemented; that space and logistical requirements are met to provide a supportive work environment for the junior officers; and that all other logistical and training needs are met for the DLI training program at the USAID Nairobi complex. <br />The Coordinator will play an important role as the DLI counselor, providing training and mentoring, will advise the DLIs of the work of the LCD Team, and will develop opportunities to train and mentor all DLIs in USAID procurement reform. . <br />LCD Team. The Agency's procurement reform group has identified as a priority area for reform within the Agency the strengthening of civil society and private sector capacity by supporting local entities who can take greater ownership over the development of their countries. This calls for increasing the number of local partners through direct grants to local nonprofit organizations; and increasing the number of local partners through direct contracts with local private businesses. Since it is recognized that engaging directly with local nonprofit organizations and private businesses can be a time consuming process, the Agency has decided to implement a pilot to establish Local Capacity Development Teams in five regional offices, one of which is USAID/East Africa.
<p>The objective of the LCD Team is to assist USAID missions and operations in the East Africa region to increase the number of local partners and concurrent funds through grants to local NGOs. The Team will assist the missions and operations to mainstream this activity into their annual programming so that it becomes part of the way the Agency does business on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The USAID/East Africa LCD Team will be comprised of four DLIs from different back-stop offices at the Mission; the Contracting Office, the Financial Management Office, the Program Office and the Technical (Health) Office. Each DLI will be paired with a senior Foreign Service National (FSN) professional in the same backstop office. DLIs will be assigned full-time for one year of their two year rotation and the FSNs will devote part of their time to work on the Team. The Team will be led by the incumbent.</p>
<p>The Team will work with Missions in the region to: (a) create more accessible eligibility criteria for local nonprofit organizations to partner with USAID; (b) develop capacity-building programs for local NGOs by training NGOs in grant and report writing, as well as in financial management, or by incorporating capacity building into NGO grants; and (c) develop and implement a Mission-wide grant programs for local NGOs. With regard to (c), the Team will work with the program and technical offices of the concerned Missions to identify areas suitable for implementation by local NGOs, develop requests for grant applications for these areas, solicit and review proposals, and issue grants. The Team will develop a monitoring and evaluation plan to ensure effective implementation and to develop best practices for increasing and improving the participation of local NGOs in the implementation of USAID's programs</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>OTI's Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages OTI country programs and field staff that includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, and start-up and close out of OTI country programs. FPD staff regularly engage with counterparts in USAID Missions overseas, Regional Bureaus, Department of State, and other offices engaged in country development issues. The FPD provides expertise and technical support for country programs and USAID Missions, and represents OTI in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Regional Team Leader manages one of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia and Middle East (AME), Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in one of OTI's three geographic regions. Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader is initially expected to manage the Africa (AFR), Asia and Middle East (AME), or Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK) teams. Two team leaders may be selected for the AF/PAK team (one for Afghanistan, one for Pakistan) given the scale of both programs. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation. The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure U.S. Government (USG) funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Regional Team Leader that will fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as OTI's principal expert on country program issues related to the region of assignment. A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program funded personal, and the development, oversight, and management of OTI's country programs. It is important that the Regional Team Leader quickly familiarize her/himself in the key tasks of the country team members in order to ensure that primary tasks are carried out appropriately and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's duties will include but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Lead and manage the Regional Team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner grants and agreements at the headquarter level. (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.);</p>
<p>&bull; Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date. It is critical to ensure that country programs are appropriately budgeted for. Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other USG sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finances and procurement;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other U.S. Government officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee the design and implementation of new country program operations to include complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee and ensure the development of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate and communicate with other DCHA, USAID, State Department, Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agency personnel in Washington and the field; cooperating country Government officials; United Nations organizations; the World Bank; and host country and international NGOs;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with the OTI program staff and implementing partner headquarter staff, the regular review of reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that field programs are provided support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee, develop and/or manage, in conjunction with the OTI Washington staff and OTI country representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, wherever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective hand-over to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces when required;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting Chief of Field Programs Division, or Country Representative in the field in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Team Leader will take direction from and will report to the Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: The vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendors intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Governments stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price.

<DESC>Questions
<p>1) A) In the Register of wage determination under the service contract act for Mississippi etc just released in FBO, it has the following:</p>
<p>12130: Medical Laboratory Technician $13.98</p>
<p>12280: Phlebotomist $13.52</p>
<p>30210: Laboratory Technician $18.70</p>
<p>I did not find Medical Technologist which is one of the positions in this solicitation. Which of the listing in the Wage determination correspond to Medical Technologist in this solicitation?</p>
<p>B) Page 44 of 50 of this solicitation has the following:</p>
<p>12130: Medical Technologist $25.35</p>
<p>12130: Medical Lab Tech $15.42</p>
<p>12130: Medical Phlebotomists $15.42</p>
<p>These are different from the rates in the wage determination. Are these based off the amount the contract personnel presently working there are currently being paid? If not, which of the rates should we go by?</p>
<p>A: We are using the code and prices in the solicitation however, use your own calculations to determine a fair quote. There will be an amendment to change the code on the Phlebotomist, it should be 12280.</p>
<p>2) According to Performance Work Statement (PWS) page 24 of 30, 1FTE is 2080 (1880 productive, 89 holidays and 120 paid time off e.g. vacation, sick leave etc). But, on solicitation, 1FTE is 1769. Which do you want us to us?</p>
<p>A: Use the hours in the solicitation.</p>
<p>3) According to PWS page 8 of 30 (1.8.5), There is no overtime. You work on holiday, you get time off. But solicitation has overtime hours. A) Which is correct?; B) If Solicitation is correct, do we use a time and one half for the overtime?</p>
<p>A: Overtime is not schedule but there is a probability that it may happen.</p>
<p>4) On the solicitation, there is travel amount of $120,000.00 and $15,000.00 for nos 007 and 0012 respectively. What is this intended for, and is it going to be standard for all bidders?</p>
<p>A: The amounts will not be exceeded...the maximum that will be paid. Amount will be monitored.</p>
<p>5) Page 24 of 50,11e: Offeror are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirement of this solicitation - each will be evaluated separately. Does this mean I can submit more than one offer for this same solicitation to increase my chances of getting the contract?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>6) If my company is not in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) yet but I we are teaming with a company already in the CPARS, will their CPARS report be considered towards my solicitation?</p>
<p>A: NO</p>
<p>7) How do I get past performance questionnaire that I can use in place of the CPARS?</p>
<p>A: Information will be requested at another stage of the process. You may provided past performance references.</p>
<p><br />8) Does the contractor or the Blood Bank Element Chief create and control the work schedule of employee?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>2) Do all positions have to cover all hours between 4:00am and 12:00am? If so 2 Medical Technologist and 2 Phlebotomist is not enough</p>
<p>3) Is there 14 or 16 FTE Medical Lab Techs? According to the PWS there is 14 and according to section B there should be 16</p>
<p>A: 16</p>
<p>4) Can you tell us how long each incumbent employee has worked under the contract there?</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220- Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. (Small Business size standard is 750 employees)
<p><br />DESCRIPTION:<br />The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing (GPSW) at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to host Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and Specification Working Groups (SWGs) in development of the Technical Requirements Document.</p>
<p>Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) sessions will be held from 25-29 October 2010. TIM sessions will be held 25 Oct 2010 (Monday) from 1200 to 1600 PST and held all other days from 0800 to 1600 at SAIC, 300 N. Sepulveda Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-4485. SWG sessions will subsequently be held 16-18 November 2010.</p>
<p>SWG sessions will be held from 0800 to 1600 each day at the SAIC facility. All meetings will be conducted in Conference Room 2060 with provision for teleconference and Data Exchange support.</p>
<p>The goal of MGUE is to develop, integrate, and produce M-code capable; GPS receivers for the designated lead service platforms specified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document dated 15 December 2009. These platforms encompass Air (e.g. F-15E, Precision Guided Munitions), Ground (Raven, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV)) and Maritime (Arleigh-Burke Class Destroyer (DDG)) domains, as well as a new military handheld unit with modernized GPS capability and improved human-machine interface features.</p>
<p>Under the emerging MGUE acquisition strategy, the GPSW is considering awarding contracts for the development and certification of production ready GPS receiver form factor cards for the Raven, EFV, F-15E, and DDG platforms that leverage existing technologies to the maximum extent to reduce development risks and to establish options for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Upon successful certification and operational tests/assessments, the GPSW intends to exercise options for Low-Rate Initial Production for these form factors. Finally, the GPSW intends to pursue an Offeror specified production ready Common GPS Module that can be integrated into handheld receivers. To ensure functionality, demonstrations will be conducted that show case the compatibility and the enhanced capabilities of a CGM integrated handheld.</p>
<p>The GPSW is particularly interested in feedback from prospective prime contractors to ensure the most appropriate document relevance and feasibility. Preliminary Industry discussion will be initially facilitated by two MGUE TIM meetings. Each TIM will focus upon a collaborative review of TRD/PP aviation and maritime requirements.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #1 will provide an overview of the most current Aviation Maritime Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and companion Protection Profile (PP) "draft" documents.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #2 will provide an overview of the most current Ground Embedded TRD and companion PP "draft" documents.</p>
<p>Subsequently, two Specification Working Group (SWG) meetings will address both platform stakeholder and industry TIM session comments.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #1 will provide an in depth discussion of the Aviation Maritime TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #1.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #2 will provide an in depth discussion of the Ground Embedded TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #2.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #3 will provide a forum to address additional Industry comments and concerns. Provision will be made to accommodate one-on-one sessions with Industry to address potentially proprietary concerns.</p>
<p>The GPSW intends to publicize all recommended changes that could affect revisions to the Request for Proposal (RFP). If your contractor team would like to participate in these TIMs and/or SWGs, please make an appointment as instructed below. Please identify a primary POC for your company, along with phone number and e-mail address.</p>

<DESC>The Contracting Department, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, VA, 23511-3392 intends to negotiate a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Firm Fixed Price pricing provisions and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  

The contractor shall provide IT services for the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET), and to accomplish migration of business support and command and control (C2) systems from legacy networks to ONE-NET.  ONE-NET provides 24/7/365 NIPRNet/SIPRNet access, network connectivity and security, electronic mail and Blackberry, file and print services, voice over SIPRNet (VOSIP), web access, and desktop support via Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs) and the Local Network Support Centers (LNSCs) located at Fleet concentration areas throughout OCONUS.
  

This 24/7/365 capability includes the functional areas of Network and Systems Operations (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Management, Network Defense (ND), Common Applications Support, and Transport Services).  Additional support extends into Service Desk, Field Services, Information Assurance, Network Technical Support, IT Service Management, Enterprise Management Support, Voice Over Internet & Telephone Support, and Theater Application Support. Through Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), ONE-NET infrastructure is installed at fourteen (14) overseas fleet concentration areas, owned and operated by NAVY CYBERFOR.
 

The ONE-NET infrastructure is comprised of three (3) TNOSCs located at Yokosuka (Japan), Naples (Italy), and Manama (Bahrain). TNOSCs function as the single point of contact for the network operations and the focal point for decisions for regional customers. These decisions involve service priorities, restoration priorities, and other enterprise-wide operational issues within their region. Service is primarily focused on Network and Systems Operations, Service Desk, Network Technical Support and Information Assurance.  The Yokosuka TNOSC services the Far East Theater and the Naples and Bahrain TNOSCs service the Europe and Middle East theaters respectively.  These three theaters are under the operational control of Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific (PAC) and NCTAMS Atlantic (LANT).

LNSCs are extensions of a TNOSC where physical presence is required.
  Service at this level shall be primarily hardware-related and limited to device and cable plant maintenance, component replacement, and providing the on-site touch labor to respond to service requests and system problems that cannot be resolved by the TNOSC remotely.  LNSC supports life-cycle maintenance activities and ONE-NET service level objectives by providing touch-labor associated with the refresh and warranty repair of devices attached to the ONE-NET network.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, and the Size Standard is $25.0M.  This prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) will be processed utilizing Full and Open Competition, and will not contain a required Small Business Subcontracting Plan as FAR Part 19 does not apply OCONUS.

The resulting contract will be for the period of a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) twelve month option years along with FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.
  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  A complete RFP package will be available by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 23 November 2010.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.
 By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POC identified in this synopsis.

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ISSUED BY THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. HOWEVER, RESPONSES MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR A FUTURE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Space Science Division (Code 7600), is requesting information and ROM estimate of cost for providing Engineering Models (EM) and spaceflight qualified calibration light sources for the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) that are part of an instrument suite proposed for a NASA EXPLORER spaceflight mission. The MDI instrument will consist of two similar units that will each measure upper atmospheric winds along their line of sight. A set of three different calibration lamps is required for each of the two MDI units. The three different lamp types are (1) an emission line source providing signal at the 630.48 nm neon line, (2) an emission line source providing signal at the 557.03 nm krypton line, and (3) a single broadband source providing a continuum emission that spans at least several nm around the 630 nm and 557 nm lines. Other lamp types emitting atomic lines with wavelengths that are within less than about 1 nm of 630 nm and 557.7 nm could also be considered. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Examples of suitable lamps are likely to include spectral lamps with external electrodes using high frequency excitation and tungsten ribbon lamps. The lamp units are to include the power supply and switch, excitation mechanism, mechanical structure, and emitting volume. The specifications referenced herein are export controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential Customers must complete the attached certification with proof of status as a U.S. Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit via email to Ms. Lisa Fleming, at <a href="mailto:lisa.fleming@nrl.navy.mil">lisa.fleming@nrl.navy.mil</a>. Upon confirmation of eligibility, potential offerers will be sent draft copies of the Statement of Work and specifications. The Statement of Work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations. Technical questions shall be directed to Christoph Englert, NRL Code 7641 via email <a href="mailto:christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil">christoph.englert@nrl.navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gauge industry interest, capabilities, and relevant heritage experience and know-how for providing the MDI calibration sources. It is the goal of NRL to maximize heritage experience and know-how and to minimize risk and cost to the MDI program. As such NRL will be using the responses and ROM cost estimates for determination of whether to procure the requirement via a formal contract or to build part or all of the hardware in-house. If NRL decides to procure this hardware, an EM lamp set would need to be delivered in mid-2013, with two sets of flight lamps and one flight spare lamp set to be delivered in mid-2014. Examples of key evaluation criteria that might be used include: 1) Relevant corporate and key personnel heritage experience and know-how, 2) Hardware performance from past programs including lamp lifetime, mass, size, power consumption, 3) Cost/cost realism, and 4) Schedule. If a solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that it will call for a three phase hybrid contract: with Phase 1 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will continue through completion of Phase A (lamp specification refinement); Phase 2 awarded on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis that will cover from the start of Phase B through CDR (EM lamp set development and delivery); and, Phase 3 awarded on a fixed price basis that will span from CDR through delivery of the flight and flight spare lamps.</p>

<a href="mailto:Gregory.M.Sabater@va.gov">CONTRACTING OFFICER</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction and Facilities Management is looking for Architect/Engineer (A/E) firms certified in the following categories: 1. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 2. Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), 3. 8(a), 4. HUB Zone, 5. Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), and/or 6. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) for the Willamette National Cemetery -  Cemetery Improvements and New Annex project. The A/E firm must be classified as a Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) or Civil Engineering (NAICS 541330) firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, master plans, schematic documents, design development documents, construction documents and providing construction period services. Prime contractor should have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm (or team) with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects. The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing Engineers, and Architect.

Probable Scope:

The project will develop a phased master plan for the newly acquired 37 acres adjacent to the existing cemetery in concert with identifying and developing master plan level (conceptual) designs for all remaining site development opportunities on the existing cemetery.  This project will also design and develop the first phase of construction which will include approximately 7,000 pre-placed crypts, 10,700 columbarium niches and 8,000 in-ground cremation sites. The new site will include: a new memorial wall with ossuary, utilities, irrigation, and supporting infrastructure, access roads, and global positioning system site integration.

In addition to development of the new acreage, the project will include the following scope within the existing cemetery: identify and design potential future burial sites, provide replacement or renovation of the existing maintenance and Administration buildings, removal of remaining underground storage tanks, demolition and replacement of the employee building 3003, new parking to have capacity for all employees at the maintenance area, development of a new spoils storage area and stabilization of the existing spoils area, renovation of existing Columbarium Number Two walkways and water seepage, installation of water main to complete irrigation loop, utilities, as well as infrastructure repairs and upgrades as identified in the Study on Improvements to Veterans Cemeteries.

The new buildings will incorporate enhanced information technology and physical security requirements and shall include Green Building Principles and Renewable Energy Initiatives. The completed buildings shall be LEED silver certified and meet all Federal Energy and Sustainability mandates. Design shall include mitigation of any environmental and historic issues identified during the environmental assessment process. Once a thorough analysis of the users and the cemeterys needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.
The project will be accomplished utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide. In addition, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected firm shall design to the governments estimated cost for construction.

The schematics and design development will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost.  A possible solicitation will include a government option for: design-build Request For Proposal (RFP) package or construction document preparation, construction period services and site visits. In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the cost and scope management capabilities of the applicants. A/E firms must be of sufficient size and have experience to accomplish the work and be licensed in the State of Oregon. Applicants must have an established working office within 150 miles of Portland, Oregon.

If your firm can meet the criteria above, PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 1) NAICS CODE, 2) SIZE STANDARD FOR SMALL BUSINESS and 3) A DETAILED DESCRIPTION (INCLUDING SIZE, SCOPE and DOLLAR VALUE) OF THE FIRMS EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING CEMETERIES OR PROJECTS OF A SIMILAR SIZE AND SCOPE.

<AWARDEE>RAININ INSTRUMENT LLC, 7500 EDGEWATER DRIVE, OAKLAND, CA 94621 US
<DESC>Solicitation APHIS-S-10-442051 was cancelled due to the fact that there were no small businesses manufactures located that could produce a product equal to what was requested. There were four models considered for this liquid handling instrumentation: the Thermo Scientific<br />Hydra DT, BioSprint, Apricot i-Pipette Pro, and the Rainin Liquidator.
<p>The decision was made to purchase the Rainin Liquidator LIQ-96-200</p>
<p>2EA LIQ-96-200 @ $11,196.00 = $22,392.00<br />2EA Service Agreement @ $ 3,930.00 = $ 7,860.00</p>
<p>Total $30,252.00</p>
<p>The criteria we used for selection of the<br />most appropriate model was based on:</p>
<p>( 1) performance (accuracy) of tasks as needed by the science we perform.<br />( 2) ease of use in daily operations<br />( 3) brand reputation, and <br />(4) cost.</p>
<p>liquid handling system will be used to pipet small quantities of reagents in a<br />molecular lab as part of DNA isolation and amplification protocols. We require a system that pipets 96<br />individual channels of liquids from plastic plates with 96 tiny tubes used in the development of methods<br />for examining DNA. This instrument will increase our throughput since at this time we pipet liquids with<br />1 and/or at most 8 channel, hand-held instrumentation. The level of accuracy is important and all three<br />instruments satisfy this criteria. Each performed well during their respective demo. The Rainin<br />Liquidator did not require any programming since it is a manual system. The two other instruments<br />require that individual pipetting steps be entered into a program routine. So, ease of use is also satisfied<br />with the Rainin Liquidator. Technicians do not need to program the instrument. Settings can be changed<br />through a dial type knob which changes the settings for volumes. It is a simple, yet accurate instrument<br />that fits the needs of the lab.</p>

<p><br />Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>"Source Selection Information - see FAR 2.101 and 3.104"</p>
<p><br />1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity. <br />a. Federal agency and contracting activity. HHS. <br />b. Sponsoring organization. NIAID<br />c. Project Officer information. <br />&bull; Project Officer name.<br />&bull; Mailing address. <br />&bull; E-mail address. <br />&bull; Telephone number. <br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. The Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) Pathogen Molecular Genetics Section studies the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus which are the most common pathogens in hospital-acquired infections. The costs related to infections caused by these strains in the hospital setting are enormous and represent a major health care burden. Furthermore, the more recent combination of extraordinary virulence and multiple antibiotic resistance in community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (CA-MRSA) poses an additional severe threat to public health. The long term objective of this research is to provide the scientific basis for the development of drugs interfering with these mechanisms. To that end, the lab is investigating the molecular biology, biochemistry and epidemiology of the interaction of staphylococci with host defenses. <br />b. Project background. The Pathogen Molecular Genetics Section currently has an outdated microscope. Recent advances in technology have provided better resolution, focus and speed options in microscopy. In order to be able to take full advantage of the information potential from this research, the lab needs to upgrade their existing microscope. This acquisition will take advantage of all parts of the existing microscope which can be used with the upgrade, thereby significantly reducing the cost of the acquisition while obtaining the improved function of the newer microscope technology.<br />3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br />a. Project title. LSM 700UGB Confocal Microscope<br />b. Project description. Carl Zeiss MicroImaging LSM 700 Confocal Microscope<br />&bull; Requirement type. <br />&#61553; Research &amp; development (R&amp;D) <br />&#61553; R &amp; D support services <br />&#61553; Support services (non-R&amp;D) <br />X Supplies/equipment<br />&#61553; Information technology (IT) <br />&#61553; Construction<br />&#61553; Architect-engineer (A &amp; E) services <br />&#61553; Design-build<br />&#61553; Other (specify): ____________________</p>

Sequence # 1523254 NOI-RML-10045 HHSN272201001111P<br />c. Total estimated dollar value and performance/delivery period. <br />$205,003.35<br />4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>X This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(_1_) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302- _1(a)(2)_.</p>
<p>&#61553; This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.</p>
<p>&#61553; This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a).</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br />a. Name and address of the proposed contractor(s). <br />Carl Zeiss MicroImaging: One Zeiss Dr.; Thornwood, NY 10594<br />b. Nature of the acquisition and proposed unique qualifications of the contractor(s). The Carl Zeiss LSM 700 Confocal Microscope is manufactured and distributed only through Carl Zeiss MIcroImaging. In order to realize the cost savings of re-using parts and accessories, the new system must be compatible with existing parts and accessories and be installed by a certified Zeiss service person. Additionally the lab staff has been trained on Zeiss microscopes, so no additional training will be needed.<br />6. Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. Indicate whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. A combined synopsis/solicitation/notice of intent was posted on FedBiz Opps from September 8, 2010 to September 22, 2010.<br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost/price to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The price is determined to be fair and reasonable based on comparison with a similar scanning microscope station for a related industry produced by Applied Spectral Imaging. This item costs $219,629 - a comparable price to the Carl Zeiss microscope in this acquisition.</p>
<p>8. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted. Internet research was conducted to determine if any US made microscopes of this type and quality exist. All confocal microscopes discovered are manufactured either in Germany or Japan. There are US distributors, but no manufacturers. This research also revealed no small businesses that manufacture or distribute confocal microscopes.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. <br />This acquisition was posted on FedBiz Opps for 15 days. Only one response was received - from Carl Zeiss Microimaging.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition<br />No other sources expressed an interest.<br />11. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or services. <br />This is a one-time acquisition and no future purchases are planned.<br />12. Program office certification. <br />This is to certify that the portions of this justification that have been developed by the undersigned program office personnel, including supporting information and/or data verifying the Government's minimum needs, schedule requirements and other rationale for other than full and open competition, are accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Project Officer Dr. Michael Otto <br />Project Officer's Immediate Supervisor Dr Frank DeLeo <br />Head of the Sponsoring Program Office Dr Frank DeLeo</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer certification. <br />This is to certify that the justification for the proposed acquisition has been reviewed and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the information and/or data provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Contracting Officer Lynda Kieres 09/30/2010</p>

2. Contracting Activity
The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Energy Business Center, 4141 Rockside Rd., Seven Hills, Ohio, 44131.

3. Description of Requirement
The VA is soliciting via a Request for Quote for the purchase of energy related equipment. 
The items requested include:
Digital cameras, SD cards, HOBO light on/off data loggers, HOBO U10 temp/RH, HOBO u12 4-Channel indoor external, software pro upgrades, fluke thermal imagers, energy software, iPads with accessories, digital light meters, amp meters, anemometers, transformer and USBMB to go with HOBO, solar pathfinders, tool bags, hand held combustion analyzers, true RMS digital voltmeters, LED street lights, LED 4' tube lights, and occupancy sensors. 

4. Proposed Action
The Sole Source procurement of lighting and energy related equipment for VISN 21.

5. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition
Authority is authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C 8127 under PL 109-461, as well as FAR 6.302-5, Authorized by Statute.

6. Nature of Acquisition to Meet the Authority Cited in Paragraph 5
Authority is authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C 8127 under PL 109-461.

7. Describe the actions taken to conduct any market research to locate sources
The contractor Quadrigae Global Enterprises, Inc. was recommended by VISN 21 as a responsible SDVOSB, registered in the VIP Database and in CCR, and has an applicable NAICS code 221119. Quadrigae Global Enterprises, Inc. has previously demonstrated their ability to complete projects at VA facilities in VISN 22 of similar size and scope.  Due to the small dollar value and need to spend the funding for this project before the end of the fiscal year, it is in the best interest of the government to sole source this procurement to Quadrigae Global Enterprises, Inc.

8. Price Analysis 
The determination of a fair and reasonable cost will be accomplished through the comparison of proposed price with the government estimate, and comparison with previous projects of similar scope and magnitude, as well as current Davis Bacon rates.  

9. Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost
The determination of a fair and reasonable cost will be accomplished through the comparison of proposed price with the government estimate.
