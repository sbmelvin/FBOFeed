NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a solicitation announcement. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran owned, and Women owned Small Business firms.

The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, anticipates a future IDIQ procurement to acquire for Architectural-Engineering Survey and Mapping services (FAR Part 16 Brooks Act procurement) in the states of Idaho (including small portions of Montana and Wyoming), Oregon and Washington.  Reclamation anticipates a separate IDIQ for each state.  

The IDIQs are to support Habitat Improvement for Anadromous Fisheries, Facility Management, and Other Reclamation Programs.

The Contractor may be called upon to prepare maps, drawings, and charts depicting information specified by Reclamation.

The proposed contract duration will be five (5) years, base year plus four option years. Sources are being sought for firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 541370 with a Small Business Size Standard of $15 million. Responses are requested with the following information, which shall not exceed a total of eight pages:

The site is located on Baranoff Island Alaska at 56 degrees 23'N and 134 degrees 39' W</p>
<p>Scope is to provide reliable data and VOIP service using a fixed VSAT satellite solution for off island connectivity. The system will be used for day-to-day scientific and facility operations for the station.   The satellite service is also required for emergency response and safety awareness. In addition to the safety needs, there is a strong push to transfer collected data off the island to collaborating scientists around the region.</p>

<p>This equipment is manufactured by Bruker Biospin Corp. The proposed source is the only known source on the market that provides an instrument with all of the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Need required for the cancer metabolism research being conducted at the NCI. Although several high field NMR spectrometers currently exist in the NCI, and in the NIH Intramural Program as a whole, nearly all of these spectrometers are configured for protein structural and dynamic studies, which typically involve scans of a single sample lasting up to several days in duration. Moreover, these spectrometers are not configured for high-throughput sample measurements required by the MC. Therefore, none of these instruments are currently configured for dedicated targeted and untargeted metabolomics protocols and procedures conducted by the MC. In addition, none of these instruments are available for the MC's use and method development on a regular basis. Furthermore, there is no comparable technology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nor other viable sources available in order to advance the MC's scientific mission. <br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: <br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow Program Support Center to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 2:00PM MST, on Aug. 9, 2017. All responses and questions must be in writing via email to Patricia Natividad, Contract Specialist at Patricia.Natividad@psc.hhs.gov.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
