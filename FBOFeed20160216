By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>THIS ORIGINAL MARKET SURVEY WAS POSTED ON THE FAA'S CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WEBSITE (FAACO.FAA.GOV).  IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, THE INFORMATION MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION.

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Governmentâs understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of one hundred (100) TDWR Antenna Servo Interface Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) which consists of fifty (50) Azimuth Servo Interface CCAs and fifty (50) Elevation Servo Interface CCAs [including two (2) each first article units] to provide continuing support of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Antenna Drive System.

The attached (DRAFT) Statement of Work (SOW) describes the following circuit card assemblies of the TDWR Antenna Drive System:

*Elevation Servo Interface CCA (P/Ns 42088-1, 42088-3, 22954-101, NSN 5998-01-363-3829)
*Azimuth Servo Interface CCA (P/Ns 42088-2, 42088-4, 22954-102, NSN 5998-01-363-6115)

BACKGROUND

Due to a recent increase in failures of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Antenna Servo Interface CCAs, the Elevation CCA and the Azimuth CCA, and to meet the need in supporting the Antenna Drive System, immediate acquisition of these units is necessary. The existing Servo Interface CCAs are at least 20 years old and are approaching the end of their economical usefulness with obsolescence factors inflating the repair costs Beyond Economical Repair (BER). All of these Servo Interface CCAs have been identified as having obsolete components that are no longer available for purchase from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

The Servo Interface CCAs must be immediately upgraded and replaced with units that are form, fit and functionally equivalent to the current units, providing updated components that are neither obsolete nor near End of Life (EOL) and are supportable over the next 20 years in the case of a failure.

Datron Systems Inc. (now L3 Communications) originally designed, developed, and manufactured the Elevation and Azimuth CCAs, which were procured by the FAA when the TDWR systems were initially fielded in the mid-1990s.  Raytheon is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) that built the TDWR system. Source control drawings are owned by Datron Systems Inc., which reserve all patent, proprietary, design use, sale, manufacturing, and reproduction rights. The FAA does not have the technical knowledge and facilities required to manufacture form-fit-function legacy units.  The FAA does not have access or rights to L3 Communications design data to provide to other vendors to establish competition for acquisition activities.

The FAA currently intends to solicit and negotiate only with L-3 Communications, 200 W. Los Angeles Avenue, Simi Valley, CA, on a single source basis.  It is anticipated that a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each CCA and forty-eight (48) production units of each CCA, will be awarded to meet this requirement.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses that are interested in and capable of manufacturing the Azimuth and Elevation Servo Interface CCAs for use in the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Antenna Drive System. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:
NAICS		Size Standard
334418		500 employees

The intent of this market survey is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to meet requirements to manufacture Form-Fit-Function replacements for the elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. Qualified vendors will need to show capability to furnish all required labor, plant, materials, fixtures, equipment, tools, test equipment, technical data/expertise and all other facilities necessary to provide Form-Fit-Function replacements for the elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs.

RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:

Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

Interested sources should provide evidence of qualifications/capabilities available to provide experienced qualified management and technical personnel to manufacture Form-Fit-Function replacements for the elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs.

The accompanying documents are intended to provide enough information for prospective companies/vendors to decide whether or not they are capable of providing elevation and azimuth CCAs that meet the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) systemâs requirements.  

Interested vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs that meet the TDWR systemâs requirements should provide sufficient information to describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can produce elevation and azimuth CCAs meeting the size, electrical (Multilayer PCB construction, VMEbus Addressing and Bus Interface, TTL Level Signaling, Synchro/Resolver A/D, Tachometer Feedback and Control, Dynamic D/A Rate Commands, etc. under specified test conditions), and military standards specified in the accompanying documents. 

Response submittals must include information for the following three (3) requests:

1.  Vendor responses will describe the resources available to meet the description set forth in this market survey and provide documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is qualified and capable of manufacturing Form-Fit-Function replacements for the elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs.  Documentation shall include ability to meet delivery requirements.  The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor.  
     *Vendor must describe capability to build the elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs without provision of source control documents by the FAA.
     *Vendorâs ability to provide two (2) each elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs within 240 days after receipt of order for First Article testing. 
     *Vendorâs ability to commence delivery of production elevation and azimuth servo interface CCAs within 60 days of the FAAâs notice to proceed.

2. Vendor shall provide a short list of Antenna/Servo Interface Projects that the vendor has successfully designed and manufactured (emphasis on Heavy Duty, High Speed, Dual Opposed Drives, Closed Loop Positioning) to demonstrate the capabilities that the vendor possesses in this area. 

3.  Completed and signed Business Declaration Form (attached) for descriptive information regarding the business status of the vendor.

All response submittals (one response per company) are to be provided with a cover letter on company letterhead.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 P.M, local time March 2, 2016.  Market survey responses received after the time and date specified may be determined to be late and may not be considered.

All response submittals, including attachments, shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:  connie.m.houpt@faa.gov, Reference: TDWR Elevation and Azimuth Servo Interface CCAs Market Survey.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with vendorâs market survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendorâs expense.

<DESC>The Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, intends to award a sole source contract, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, to the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS).  Authority to sole source to NIBS is provided for in 12 USC 1701j-2(g)(3).  This contract will be awarded to identify the state of the `Stadiums and Arenas? Sector (sector), in terms of energy and water performance, and develop a strategic vision for potential engagement of the sector in addressing identified opportunities and challenges. The buildings and facilities that support athletic activities exist in communities across the country from big cities to college towns. These facilities are special in that they house specific functions and often ramp up to provide energy and water intensive services for periods of time while remaining in ?standby? mode at other times. The distinct nature of these facilities is what makes this endeavor unique. DOE intends to establish a dialogue to bring together stadium and arena owners and operators and building professionals to examine the current state of performance and identify the opportunities and challenges in advancing the design, construction and operation of high-performance facilities.  Through a series of workshops, webinars, targeted outreach and research, NIBS will identify the state of the sector.  DOE will use this information to help develop a strategic vision for potential engagement of the sector in addressing identified opportunities and challenges in advancing energy and water performance.
In order to determine the current state of this sector, the DOE will acquire contractor services to: ?

OVERVIEW: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), a component of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is seeking potential sources capable of providing transportation services for the "2016 National Veterans Golden Age Games".  

The purpose of this unclassified request for information (RFI) is to enable the National Veterans Golden Age Games (NVGAG) representatives to obtain information from vendors who can provide equipment, labor, supervision and other resources required to provide ground transportation bus service and luggage pick-up support to senior Veterans, support staff and volunteers for the "2016 National Veterans Golden Age Games".  

The event will be held over a total period of six (6) days, from July10-15, 2016 in Detroit, MI.  The vendor will need to supply adequate equipment and personnel to provide bus transportation for approximately 1,000 ambulatory individuals, accessible bus transportation for approximately 75-100 individuals in wheelchairs/scooters, and adequate personnel and spacing for airport luggage support during the entire time period. In addition, this work will involve site-visits for route reviews to venues, documented competencies of employees providing Veteran transportation, and an on-site Project Manager during event hours.  Vendor must be able to operate all necessary buses during specific peak times during the 2016 NVGAG that the schedule requires.  A Transportation Schedule will be provided once an official bid solicitation has been initiated; however, please note, average event times run from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Buses must:
	
1.	Be air-conditioned school buses;
2.	Provide a step stool if there is a great distance (8 inches of more) from ground to first step on regular school buses;
3.	Be able to safely transport a minimum of 45 ambulatory individuals, per load, on regular school buses, to various areas within the Omaha community;
4.	Be able to safely transport a minimum of 6-8 individuals in wheelchairs/scooters, per load, on accessible school buses, to various areas within the Omaha community; and
5.	Be able to accommodate luggage transport during airport arrival and departure days of the event.

BACKGROUND:  The National Veterans Golden Age Games is the premier senior adaptive rehabilitation program in the United States, and is the only national multi-event sports and recreational seniors' competition program designed to improve the quality of life for all older veterans, including those with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. The National Veterans Golden Age Games serves as a national showcase for the preventative and therapeutic value of sports, fitness and recreation. The Games serve as a qualifying event for competition in the National Senior Games in a number of competitive events. 

The NVGAG will use this information to gain a better understanding of industry's ability to support the event's ground transportation needs.  This information will be fundamental to shaping the Department's future facilitation efforts.  In addition to providing an overview of the program requirements, the government's intent is to use vendor-provided information during one-on-one discussions to further our information collection.

<DESC>An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) that is mounted inside of a vibration dampened glove box. The glove box also provides for atmospheric type, pressure, and humidity control thru the use of a standalone Purifier and turbo-molecular vacuum pump. An Antechamber (load lock system) is used to provide a means of loading and unloading samples without destroying the atmospheric integrity of the glove box. The glove box is mounted on a support base capable of supporting no less a 1000 pound weight of the glove box and microscope. The microscope uses advanced technology controller to achieve the high resolutions in the X-Y, and Z-direction in all modes of operation. The microscope should be able to operate in a variety of measurement modes, including the contact, intermittent contact (or tapping), lateral force, lift, magnetic force, amplitude and phase, frequency-shift, peak force, electrical characterization, and nanoindentation mode.

<DESC>Aerospace Engineering Services - Tinker AFB Commodities Engineering is seeking sources to develop reliability and maintainability improvements for the F-15 rudder actuator, part number 3U3151-5E, 1650-01-065-7768, CAGE 60029.
<p>This is not a solicitation / request for proposal and no contract shall result from this notice. The Government does not intend to issue a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein. After the review of the responses to this sources sought notice, and if the Air Force still plans to proceed with the effort, a solicitation announcement will be published on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website. Submission of a response to this notice is in no way considered a proposal for services. Responses to this notice are NOT a request to be added to the list of approved vendors for the manufacture or re-manufacture of the F-15 rudder actuators or to receive a copy of the potential engineering services solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p>Statement of Service:<br />The Air Force has a need for an improved F-15 rudder actuator. The F-15 aircraft will continue to fly for another 25 years. The existing rudder actuator design is outdated and current reliability is limited to approximately 800 flight hours (MTBF). The rudder actuator is part of the F-15 primary flight control system controlling the yaw axis authority of the aircraft. The rudder actuator consists of an actuator fitting assembly, a master control and bypass valve assembly, a linkage body assembly, a reservoir thermal relief and check valve, two damping mode replenishing check valves and a differential relief valve. The service provider would be required to provide engineering services as necessary to develop engineering design changes to the rudder actuator, build prototypes and perform a variety of testing including function and qualification of the rudder actuator to the requirements in the performance specification. For the purpose of this notice, the below requirements apply:</p>
<p>-- Form, fit and function interchangeability must be maintained</p>
<p>-- Improve Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) to a minimum of 2000 hours</p>
<p>-- Provide a complete, Government-purposes technical data package for all parts changes or developed to include manufacture, inspection, repair or refurbishment</p>
<p>-- Analog (AV) voltage position output (0 -10Vrms) added to the jack for the actuator</p>
<p>If an offeror believes that they may have the skills and capabilities to perform this engineering service, provide completed copy of DD2345 to the contact below (email is acceptable). Upon review of the DD2345 a copy of the non-confidential, non-proprietary Performance Specification (PS) will be provided via email. This PS will contain detailed functional, performance, durability and qualification requirements for the item. In addition, an offeror shall provide details on similar reliability and maintainability projects such as scope of previous projects, design changes and qualification testing that was performed.</p>
<p>423 Supply Chain Management Squadron<br />Attn: Jenny Ewy<br />Bldg 3001, post 1AB1-100A<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145<br />Jenny.Ewy@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Within three months of this sources sought notice, potential sources should provide a rough outline on proposed improvements and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing for the engineering service in question. Details for potential prototypes, quantity of prototypes and qualification testing will be detailed at a later date.</p>
<p>All material provided in response to this notice shall be unclassified, non-confidential, and non-proprietary to the maximum extent practicable. Digital and physical responses to this notice will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse any preparation costs. At any time after receipt of responses, the Government reserves the right to contact respondents for further discussion and/or clarification of the submittal.</p>
<p>Again, this is a sources sought notice and in no way represents the Governments intent to solicit or award any future contracts. The Government is solely seeking to identify potential sources available to meet the Governments need.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey for 155mm Howitzer, Artillery-launched, Sensor Fused Munition (SFM) solutions.
<p>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify 155mm Howitzer, Artillery-launched, Sensor Fused Munition (SFM) solutions. It is desired that the operation and capabilities of the SFM be analogous to the M898 Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) projectile, and is compliant with the US DoD Cluster Munition Policy (&lt; 1% Unexploded Ordnance [UXO]). The SFM must demonstrate capability against massed, poorly located, mechanized armored vehicles; that may be in a GPS denied environment. Mechanized armor targets include target types such as Main Battle Tanks, Light Tanks, Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs), Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) and Self-Propelled Artillery. Responses should be provided with the following assumptions:</p>
<p>&bull; Enter Post Milestone-B Qualification Testing in FY19 using existing US Army 155mm Cannon Artillery Systems (M109A6 or M777A2) to provide information for a Type Classification Standard, Full Material Release (TC/FMR) decision<br />&bull; Empirical evidence of compliance with US DoD Cluster Munition Policy (If available)<br />&bull; Compatible with US Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS)<br />&bull; Production contract award in FY20<br />&bull; Initial SFM deliveries in FY21<br />&bull; Production rate of 1,000 all-up-round munition deliveries per year for a 5 year period.</p>
<p>Interested firms should provide their qualifications and capabilities within thirty (30) calendar days of this published notice in the form of a White Paper via email to Marcus Edmundson, ACC-NJ-CA Bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, marcus.l.edmundson.civ@mail.mil. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Provide manufacturer's name, address, point-of-contact with telephone number and email address, size of business (small/large), and country where the facility is located. White papers should describe existing test information that could be utilized to support a TC/FMR decision, developmental/qualification scope &amp; costs, US DoD Cluster Munition policy compliance costs (development, test), production costs, milestone schedule (based upon above assumptions) and risks (management, technical and production).</p>
<p>This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has no obligation to provide responses to this Market Survey.</p>

<SOLNBR>W912WJ-16-X-0016
<CONTACT>Alysha MacDonald, Contract Specialist, Phone 9783188715, Email Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for the Concrete Spalling Repairs project at the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, located in Providence, Rhode Island, to determine the interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS code for these procurements is 238110. The project is planned to be issued on or about July 2016. The project will occur in the fall of 2016 through 2017 and is expected to take about nine months, including submittal approval. The estimated construction cost is between $100,000.00 and $500,000.00.
<p><br />The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is located at the head of the Narragansett Bay in Providence Rhode Island. Originally built in 1960-1966, the Barrier has protected the downtown of Providence against storm surges many times. Although designed and built by the Corps of Engineers, the Barrier was operated by the City of Providence until 2010 when it was turned over to the Corps. The Barrier and the pump house are mainly composed of concrete. The concrete has suffered damage due to deterioration and vehicular impact. Deterioration of the concrete includes delamination and spalling. The effects of deterioration have been amplified by the existence of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), which expands the concrete and affects its serviceability. The presence of ASR was confirmed in the spring of 2015 by means of petrographic examination.</p>
<p><br />This project will only address concrete repairs on the ocean side of the Pumping Station and joint repairs along the service bridge that connects the Pumping Station to the tainter gates. Additional concrete repairs to other sides of the Pumping Station or Barrier will not be addressed as part of this contract.</p>
<p><br />This project will consist of the following components:<br />-Remove loose concrete material at areas having spalling and delamination, clean with a high pressure water blast, apply a bonding agent, form, and place reinforced concrete. Access to some of this work area will require fall protection.<br />-Repair joints along the service bridge by removing existing elastomeric material, cleaning the surfaces, and installing new flexible joints.<br />-Rebar replacement may be needed.<br />-No underwater repairs are included in this contract.<br />-Scaffolding will be needed. Most can be freestanding, but some will need to be hung from a platform edge.<br />-Project is envisioned to repair all areas of spalled and delaminated concrete on the ocean side of the Pumping Station.</p>
<p><br />Contractor should note that some work on this project may require fall protection.</p>
<p><br />Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above. Please include at least two specific examples of the firm's experience performing the work requirements stated above. The projects must have been performed within the last five years. Please indicate the team subcontractors that will be used to support the offeror's effort and include their prior experience and qualifications. Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are due March 8, 2016. Email responses to Alysha MacDonald at alysha.macdonald@usace.army.mil. Responses are limited to twenty pages. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is NOT a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. Response is strictly voluntary; No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought announcement or any follow-up information requests. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Wildlife Services (WS), Riverdale, MD, intends to issue a sole source purchase order with Royal Oak Charcoal, for the purchase of Charcoal for use in the manufacturing of Rodent gas cartridges. <br /><br />Royal Oak is the suggested contractor as they are the only known source able to supply the adequate product. It is also suggested as the source because it is listed on the Statement of formulation as the supplier of charcoal used in rodent gas cartridges as required by the EPA. Because Rodent Gas Cartridges are an EPA registered pesticide and because charcoal is an approved active ingredient in the pesticide, changes of the source of an active ingredient to a new unregistered source can take 8 months and can cost more than $13,000 (See attached Pesticide Registration Improvement Act Table). This fee will be passed on to any potential contractor interested in adding there company to the statement of formulation. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supply for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Simplified procurement procedures will be used as well as commercial item acquisition procedures per FAR 12.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NASA/JSC intends to purchase these requirements from InnoCentive, Inc. InnoCentive, Inc. has the required IT infrastructure necessary to support the requirements and access to a broad community of NASA challenge solvers. Use of any other system would require duplication of work and loss of the existing infrastructure that has been designed, tested, validated, and proved successful within the existing community and with the NASA's e-authentication system. A loss of the existing infrastructure cannot be recovered by the Government through competition without substantial duplication of time, costs, and risk to timely and successful implementation.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the Contracting Officer, Aubrie Henspeter at aubrie.henspeter@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. local time (Central Standard Time) on February 26, 2016. Please reference NNJ16579096L in any response. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p><br />NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>

<p align="left">52.211-8 TIME OF DELIVERY</p>
<p align="left">(IAW FAR 11.404(a)(2))</p>
<p align="left">(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p align="left">DELIVERY FOR EACH ITEM IS ANNOTATED IN THE SCHEDULE (PART I SECTION B) UNDER EACH LINE</p>
<p align="left">ITEM.</p>
<p align="left">The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within</p>
<p align="left">the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the</p>
<p align="left">applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government</p>
<p align="left">reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an</p>
<p align="left">offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the</p>
<p align="left">required delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p align="left">ANNOTATE YOUR PROPOSED DELIVERY, IF ANY, UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S DELIVERY SET FORTH</p>
<p align="left">UNDER EACH ITEM IN THE SCHEDULE.</p>
<p align="left">(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or</p>
<p align="left">acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The</p>
<p align="left">Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is</p>
<p align="left">dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of</p>
<p align="left">award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary</p>
<p align="left">mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of</p>
<p align="left">receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the</p>
<p align="left">ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted</p>
<p align="left">electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the</p>
<p align="left">offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.</p>

<p align="left">and</p>
<p align="left">(4) <strong>[ ] Have, [ ] have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent</p>
<p align="left">Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p align="left">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p align="left">(A) <em>The tax liability is finally determined</em>. The liability is finally determined if it has been</p>
<p align="left">assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial</p>
<p align="left">challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally</p>
<p align="left">determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p align="left">(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment</em>. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer</p>
<p align="left">has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is</p>
<p align="left">not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) <em>Examples</em>.</p>
<p align="left">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212,</p>
<p align="left">which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is</p>
<p align="left">not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax</p>
<p align="left">Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial</p>
<p align="left">appear rights.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability,</p>
<p align="left">and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer</p>
<p align="left">to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further</p>
<p align="left">appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the</p>
<p align="left">hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer</p>
<p align="left">has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it</p>
<p align="left">is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final</p>
<p align="left">tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section</p>
<p align="left">6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the</p>
<p align="left">agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently</p>
<p align="left">required to make full payment.</p>
<p align="left">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent</p>
<p align="left">because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy</p>
<p align="left">Code).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- <br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<DESC>The CREATE program seeks proposals to develop, and experimentally test, systems that use crowdsourcing and structured analytic techniques (STs) to improve analytic reasoning. These systems will help people better understand the evidence and assumptions that support-or conflict with-conclusions. Secondarily, they will also help users better communicate their reasoning and conclusions. STs hold promise for increasing the logical rigor and transparency of analysis. They can help reveal underlying logic and identify unstated assumptions. Yet they are not widely used in the Intelligence Community or elsewhere-possibly because current versions are cumbersome or require too much time. Crowdsourcing has the potential to solve these problems by dividing the labor, allowing dispersed groups of analysts to contribute information and ideas where they have comparative advantages. Crowdsourcing can help analysts identify and understand alternative hypotheses, arguments, and points of view. Crowdsourcing of structured techniques may facilitate rational deliberation by integrating different perspectives, so that analysis can effectively benefit from "crowd wisdom."

<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(4) The Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774);</p>
<p>(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and</p>
<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under<br />I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a<br /><br />final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under<br />I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to<br />I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.<br />&sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). [_] TIN: . [_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:</p>
<p>[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;</p>

<p>(1)</p>
<p><br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of- name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)<br /><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract,<br />e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.<br />The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:<br /> (1)	This is a solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only written solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p><br />(2)	The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-2016-196 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase order for this requirement.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION AUTHORITY:<br />This acquisition is for a commercial service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><br />(3)	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-86-2 dated February 1, 2016.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE:<br />(4)	The associated NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $15 Million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />(5)	The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is conducting a project to determine the function of insulin in the taste buds cells of the tongue by specifically deleting insulin in the taste bud cells of the tongue of mice but allowing for normal expression of insulin in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br />(6)	The purpose of this requirement is to procure production services for three mouse models and produce a fourth mouse model which will help to determine the function of insulin in the taste buds cells of the tongue by specifically deleting insulin in the taste bud cells of the tongue of mice but allowing for normal expression of insulin in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.<br />Project Requirements: Specifically, the Contractor shall provide the following services for mice that will be mated for up to three (3) months or until up to 25 tails have been genotyped:</p>
<p>1.	The contractor is required to make three transgenic mouse models and provide at least one breeding pair of homozygous mice for each of these mouse models to NIA.</p>
<p>2.	Contractor shall use sophisticated molecular biology tools and their expertise to determine how to do this exactly and will make the constructs to inject into the ES cell lines and then breed the mice to get at least one breeding pair of homozygous mice for each of the three mouse models. Mice of each model constitute a deliverable to the NIA.</p>
<p>3.	The contractor will then cross two of these mouse models to produce a fourth mouse model and provide NIA with at least one breeding pair of mice homozygous for the two genes in question.</p>
<p>The four mouse models shall be generated as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Mouse Model # 1<br />Mouse model in which the insulin 1 gene is absent in the entire animal i.e. a conventional knockout of the insulin 1 gene.</p>
<p>2.	Mouse Model # 2<br />Mouse model in which the insulin 2 gene is absent in the entire animal i.e. a conventional knockout of the insulin 2 gene.</p>
<p>3.	Mouse Model # 3<br />Mouse model in which the insulin 2 gene is floxed in the entire animal i.e. a mouse that will allow NIA to make a conditional knockout of the insulin 2 gene.</p>
<p>4.	Mouse Model #4<br />Contractor shall breed mouse model # 1 with mouse model #3 to generate mice that are homozygous for both mutations. Contractor shall provide the NIA with at least one breeding pair of mice that are homozygous for both transgenes.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>

The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI).

(c) Additional Requirements for Foreign Nationals (Non-U.S. Citizens). To be employed under this contract within the United States, non-U.S. citizens must have: (1) Official legal status in the United States; (2) Continuously resided in the United States for the last two years; and (3) Obtained advance approval from the servicing Security Officer of the contracting operating unit in consultation with the DOC Office of Security (OSY) headquarters.

Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

<DESC>Department of State, Office of Medical Services (MED/QI), requires a real time, 24/7/365, continuously available, telemedicine consultation service to assist individual MED providers on an intermittent, as needed, basis worldwide. MED personnel are required to provide urgent medical care for a wide variety of medical conditions, in a wide range of locations, some of which are in high threat areas and/or are austere. MED intends to facilitate provision of the highest quality levels of care. To do so requires access to very competent and specialized medical resources in order to provide consultations that are needed for a wide spectrum of possible illnesses and injuries. The Contractor shall be required to provide MED's medical staff with rapid access to state-of-the-art, knowledgeable, very specialized medical consultants appropriate to that wide range of medical conditions. The Contractor must have the equipment and experience to facilitate telecommunications and provide real-time, expert clinical advice on an "as needed" but urgent basis.

<p>Additional information regarding USU can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p><em>USU has a requirement for emergency repairs of an Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd Gamma Cell 40 irradiator.</em></p>
<p>The Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd (AECL) Gammacell l 40 Cesium-137 low dose rate irradiator has experienced a failure and the chamber door will no longer open.   A service visit is required to diagnosis the cause of the failure and repair the unit.  The exact repair required is unknown and may include the interlock system and/or the associated radioactive source material rods.  The unit was originally installed in 1981 and the serial number is 60.  See the attached Statement of Work for further details.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-86-2 (February 1, 2016) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (December 30, 2015).</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered in www.SAM.gov, with completed representations and certifications by the close date of the solicitation.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Base Access:</span></p>
<p>RapidGate (Base Access) - Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers, and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at the vendor's own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider. Credentials will be issued every 5 years and access privileges will be reviewed and renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid to obtain long term<br />NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found under "Popular Links" on the CNIC Headquarters public website at<br />https://g2.cnic.navy.mil/CNICHQ/Pages/Default.aspx.</p>
<p>DoD-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirements:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes?

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

<DESC><strong>This requirement is now being competed under solicitation number HU0001-16-Q-0188. &nbsp;Please see posting for full details:&nbsp;<br /><br />https://www.fbo.gov/notices/77772baa7c7bbcfc0eaa134eac1663c9<br /></strong><br /><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Best Theratronics located in Kanata, Ontario, Canada for emergency repairs to an Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd Gamma Cell 40 irradiator.<br /><br />This repairs will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br /><em>FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency<br /><br />(a) Application. This authority applies to those situations where (1) an unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and (2) delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.<br /></em><br />An urgent procurement is being processed to repair a Gamma Cell 40 irradiator which has experienced an unexpected failure of the interlock system and source movement rods causing the equipment to become inoperable.  The failure of the unit has caused highly sensitive and essential research within the School of Medicine to completely stop and it jeopardizes the project which is being conducted in collaboration with other agencies.  Two vendors were contacted regarding this repair and only one response was received from Best Theratronics.  As further delays will jeopardize the research project, it is recommended that a sole source award be provided to Best Theratronics.<br /><br />All conditions provided in FAR 6.303 and 6.304 exist.  The justification has been documented and has been determined to be accurate, items included in FAR 6.303-2(b) have been recorded, and the contracting officer has approved the action, which is expected to be under $700,000.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Offerors interested in responding to this notice must do so by 3:00 p.m. EST on February 22, 2016.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (sherri.ori@usuhs.edu).    <br />

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0003 is for the incorporating the Questions and Answers:
Q. Page 4 Technical Proposal Â¿ noting only a 10 page limit are the amendment pages and pricing in addition of this limit?
A. No amendments and bid schedule are not part of the 10 page limit
Q. Page 4 Past Performance Â¿ the return of reference questionnaires by our clients to you, is the same date (February, 22nd) the same deadline?
A. Yes
Q. To confirm there is no travel anticipated, but that all business can be conducted electronically and via conference call?
A. This is correct, no travel will take place.
Q. How many different versions of the business plan would be required?
A. Unless otherwise specified, we require two accessible PDFs of each plan -- one high-resolution (i.e., for printing) and one low-resolution (i.e., for web posting) versions. As stated in the scope: Â¿High- and low-resolution PDF files. The low-resolution PDF should be suitable for posting to a park's website (less than 7 MB) and should be accessible for the visually impaired and others with disabilities.Â¿
Q.    How many different versions of the brochures would be required?
A. Unless otherwise specified, we require two accessible PDFs of each brochure -- one high-resolution (i.e., for printing) and one low-resolution (i.e., for web posting) versions.
Q.    How many, on average, graphs would be included in each business plan?
A. For example, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail business plan has: Word Count = 15,208, Photos = 53, Charts/Graphs = 22
Q. Would infographics be required or traditional graphics for business plans?
A. Infographics arenÂ¿t required, but are preferred. As we are not experts in graphics, we prefer a contractor who can develop appropriate graphics based on the data we provide whenever and wherever possible.
Q. Would printing be required or just electronic PDF versions be acceptable?
A. No professional printing is required. As stated in the scope, the deliverables (Section 3.7) are electronic PDFs, two high-resolution full-sized digital printouts, two disks or media with files, and completed GPO forms. 
Q. What is the total number of anticipated hours of graphic design for the entire period of performance?  Please provide a sample of a previous business plan.
A.

This is for one business plan and is only an estimate. We do not have a sample business plan.
Q Is this a new opportunity or a continuation of an existing project?
A. This is a new opportunity
Q. If it is an existing project, is there anyway we can know how often the IDIQ vehicle was utilized or historically how many business plans were produced each year by the Business Management Group?
A. This is the first IDIQ being issued for this procurement. The BMG has historically contracted design services for, on average, three business plans per year.
Q. If this is an existing project, who is the incumbent?
A. There is no incumbent
Q. Is the cost information and associated spreadsheets included in the 10 page limit?
A. No the 10 page limit only applies to the Technical Proposal.
Q. Can you provide an estimate of approximately how many plans will be designed over the course of the first year of the contract? 
A. We estimate two plans and one brochure.
Q. Will the bulk of the plans be from within one specific NPS region or is this a nationwide initiative?
A. The bulk of the plans will be from one office not NPS-wide.
Q Is this a new requirement?
A. Yes this is a new requirement.
Q. What is the deadline for references to complete and return past performance questionnaires?
A. Past performance questionnaires are due by the end date of the RFP.
Q. Can samples of past work be included as attachments to the proposal? If so, will they be considered in the technical evaluation and will it be counted against the 10-page limit?
A. Samples of past work would be considered part of the technical proposal and part of the 10 pg limit.
Q. Is the Past Experience section (section 2) part of the 10-page limit for the Technical Proposal? If not, is there a page limit on the Past Experience section (section 2)?
A. Past experience references are not part of the 10 page limit. It is its own evaluation criteria.
Q. Is the contractor responsible for incurring the cost of printing and shipping the final plans or for managing the printing and shipping process? If so, how many copies are anticipated and where will the final plans be shipped? 
A. The contractor is responsible for shipping the deliverables outlined in the scope (Section 3.7), which entail electronic PDFs, two high-resolution full-sized digital printouts, two disks or media with files, and completed GPO forms, to the BMG in Washington, DC. The contractor is not responsible any other printing or shipping costs.
Q. Must the three past performance questionnaires be provided by the same three references provided in the Past Performance section of the proposal?
A. No 
Q. Can the proposer submit Past Performance questionnaires from contracts conducted for non-federal government customers?
A. Yes
Q. Section 3.0 - Work to be Performed states, Â¿the contractor shall provide all publication planning, editing, and design services including labor, materials, equipment, and facilities necessary for the development of two printed business plans and one brochure.Â¿ Does this mean two different printed business plans and one brochure or one printed business plan, one electronic-only version of the same plan, and one brochure?
A. This was a typo and specific to the first task order. The text should read: Â¿the contractor shall provide all publication planning, editing, and design services including labor, materials, equipment, and facilities necessary for the development of all plans and brochures.Â¿ 
Q. Amendment 000001, item (ix) requests Â¿key personnel information.Â¿ What information would the government like to see and how will key personnel information be evaluated?

TOTAL: NTE 110 DAYS

Q. Is the entire proposal not to exceed 10 pages in length? Or is just the technical part of the proposal not to exceed 10 pages?
A. Just the Technical Proposal.
Q. Can you tell me if the past bid results are available online, if not can you send them to me or if needed please provide me with the FOIA requirements/forms you have.
A. I do not have information on past projects. You can search FPDS-NG and if desiring to submit a FOIA go to foia.gov for more information.
Q. What is the anticipated volume? How many business plans would be produced per year? How many brochures?
A. The first task order is expected to include two business plans and one brochure. The BMG has historically contracted design services for, on average, three business plans per year
Q. Do we understand correctly that every park publishes a business plan every 5 years? Can you provide the current Â¿rotationÂ¿ or schedule of which parks have publications upcoming in the next 2 or 3 years?
A. No, parks do not regularly publish or cycle through business plan. We do not have a schedule for upcoming plans. The first task order is expected to include two business plans and one brochure. The BMG has historically contracted design services for, on average, three business plans per year
Q. Can you provide the past spending by year over the last contract?
A. Spending varies by the number of plans completed each year. On average, each plan costs between $7,000-$12,000K, depending on length and complexity. We average about three business plans per year.
Q. Do you have a sample of the electronic version of the business plan? Would it be an interactive pdf? Would it be an eBook?
A. ItÂ¿s like an e-book or e-magazine. We do not have one publicly available, however we do have template files to share with the contractor selected.
Q. Will the Government provide images with all necessary rights in place for possible use in each publication? Does each park have a database of images for use?
A. The Government will provide all images, from the NPS library or owned by the park, before the design process. 
Q. What is the desired level of interactivity for the PDF? Full 508 compliance? Standard interactivity like bookmarks? Or somewhere in between such as table of contents internal page links or hyperlinks, navigation buttons, embedded multimedia (audio/video), etc.?
A. See attachment: SOW Attachment 2_Graphic Design BMG.pdf
Q. On the Request for Quotation, each CLIN (0010-0060; 0080-0130)) lists a page range. Are we correct to interpret this as a cumulative price? For example, the price for the first 10 pages of the business plan is X, the price for the next 10 pages (CLIN 0020) is Y, the price for the next 10 pages (CLIN 0030) is Z, and so on? Or are you looking, instead, for the price of a 10 page document in full (CLIN 0010), the price of a 20 page document in full (CLIN 0020), the price of a 30 page document in full (CLIN 0030), and so on?
A. The bid schedule requires pricing for a business plan for pages ranging from 1-10, then if the business plan has 11-20 pages we request pricing for that, then if the business plan has 21- 30 pages we request pricing for that and so on.
Q. Is it possible to see samples of the business plan template created by BMG?
A.  Antietam NB Business Plan and Pinnacles NP Business Plan
Q. Because the IDIQ contract will be issued as a firm fixed price, and a maximum of $400,000 regardless of quantity, can we have an idea of how often design services might be required?
A. We average about three business plans per year.
Q. Can multiple references from the same contract be used? 
A. No
Q. Should these be the same references who will need to complete the Past Performance Questionnaire? 
A. No
Q. Will samples of our own company collateral created in-house be acceptable past performance evidence?
A. No
Q. Under Inspection of Services, what constitutes Â¿an inspection system acceptable to the GovernmentÂ¿?
A. This was inadvertently included in the RFP and is not applicable to this procurement, we apologize for the  confusion.
Q. On page 1, item 10: Â¿This Acquisition isÂ¿ has the box for Â¿unrestrictedÂ¿ checked, but on page 3, under Background Information, it states that Â¿This is set aside for small business concerns.Â¿ Can you confirm that this is a set aside for small businesses? 
A. This was issued as restricted, however our procurement data systems transmitted as unrestricted. There is no way to change this in the system. This is a small business set-aside.
Q. On page 16, paragraph 4: For the deliverable of the electric-only plan, is this plan a separate deliverable from the other 2 printed business plans? What technologies should the electronic-only plans be formatted for? Is the content for the electronic-only plan the same as for the 2 printed business plans? 
A. Yes, itÂ¿s a separate deliverable and structured like an e-book or e-magazine. We do not have one publicly available, however we do have template files to share with the selected contractor. For a given project or park, we will develop either a printed (including accessible PDFs) version of the business plan OR an e-business plan, not both.
Q. On page 16, section 3.0 Work to be Performed, paragraph 1: Since the scope of work states 2 business plans and 1 brochure are to be delivered, how do we estimate the work involved in the 4th paragraph that states Â¿Some business plans may also include the development of brochures or other shorter documents based on the business plan content. The brochure will also be a full-color publication.Â¿ ? It is unclear the quantity and length of any additional brochures or shorter documents. Can you clarify what additional deliverables, if any, might be required?
A. Not at this time. The specification for 2 plans and 1 brochure was a typo and specific only to the imminent task order. Additional deliverables will depend on the project. The intent of this statement was to indicate all content for shorter documents will be based on the content developed for the longer plan. 
Q. On page 23, the Bid Schedule: there are CLINs for one printed business plan and CLINs for one electronic-only business plan - can you clarify if the 2 printed business plans listed on page 16 under section 3.0 Work to be Performed is referring to these two plans? We want to clarify if there are a total of two business plans that are being designed. 
A. As outlined in the scope (Section 3.7) the deliverables for each printed business plan include two electronic PDFs (one high-res for printing, one low-res for web posting). Electronic-only business plans are a separate product.
Q. On page 17, Item 4 Original Illustration Services: Approximately how many data visualizations (graphs, infographics, charts,etc.) are anticipated for each business plan?
A: For example, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail business plan in 2014 had: Word Count = 15,208, Photos = 53, Charts/Graphs = 22
Q. Is there anywhere we can find/see the existing business plans that are to be designed?
A.  Antietam NB Business Plan and Pinnacles NP Business Plan
Q. The two amendments only need to be acknowledged within our final proposal submission, right?
A. The SF1449 and all Amendments must be signed and submitted. They are not part of the 10page limit for technical proposal.
Q. The government listed the suggested vendor as Graphic Design Business Plans, if that is the case why doesnÂ¿t  the government sole source this?
A. This is a competitive procurement and does not qualify for a sole source as there is ample competition.
Q. It seems like the description of the Electronic Business plan in the SOW calls for more than just a 508 compliant PDF?
A. Yes, itÂ¿s a separate deliverable and structured like an e-book or e-magazine. We do not have one publicly available, however we do have template files to share with the selected contractor. 
Q.Is there an example of an electronic business plan so offerors can get an idea of how they are different than a simple PDF of the print version?
A. We do not have one publicly available, however we do have template files to share with the selected contractor. ItÂ¿s a separate deliverable and structured like an e-book or e-magazine, rather than a simply PDF.
Q. IÂ¿d like to submit a bid on this opportunity, but want to select the best designer for the job. Can you send me a sample business plan that I can use to focus on the needed skillset for the work.
A.  Antietam NB Business Plan and Pinnacles NP Business Plan
Q. Can you tell me if the past bid results are available online, if not can you send them to me or if needed please provide me with the FOIA requirements/forms you have.
A. P15PC00101 in the amount of $29,600.00 XNR Productions Inc. If you desire to submit a FOIA go to foia.gov for instructions.

<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) issued a modification of a previously awarded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N00421-09-C-0102) to BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services of Rockville, Maryland exercising an option to extend services via FAR Clause 52.217-8 for an additional 203,000 hours of support services. Services include the rapid design, development, customization, fabrication, integration, test and evaluation, installation, certification, maintenance and upgrade, logistic, and life cycle support of new and/or existing Communication-Electronic platforms, equipment/systems and subsystems in support of the NAWCAD's Special Communications Mission Solutions Division. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0102 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work, BAE was the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. All questions shall be submitted to Carolyn Emmart via email at carolyn.emmart@navy.mil.</p>

Please find the event details listed below:<br /><br />1. Event: <strong>TSA 3rd Party Test Program Industry Day<br /></strong>2. Date: <strong>Thursday, 25 February 2016<br /></strong>3. Time: <strong>12:30pm - 4:30pm</strong><br />4. Location: <strong>TSIF - Briefing Room 202</strong>, 1 West Post Office Road, Arlington, VA 22202 <br />5. Deadline to Reply and Register:&nbsp;<strong>19 February 2016</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(updated)</span><br /><br />The TSA invites interested Transportation Security Equipment (TSE) manufacturers, TSA employees, and potential TSA approved 3rd Party Test Organizations to attend this Industry Day. Due to building logistics and space, the TSA will only be able to accommodate a limited number of people from each organization. Advance registration is mandatory.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For consideration</span>, please review the attached document, "Third Party Testing RFI," and submit the following required information to ThirdPartyTesting@tsa.dhs.gov:<br /><br />1. Full Name<br />2. Title/Position<br />3. Organization/Company Name<br />4. Email Address<br />5. Phone Number<br />6. Current TSA Contractor (Yes/No)<br />7. Response to quesitons and information requested in the attached document, "Third Party Testing RFI."<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of this Posting</span>: The purpose of this amendment to RFI HSTS04-14-OSC-3rd_Party_Testing_Model is to communicate information regarding the planned TSA Industry Day on 25 February 2016 to discuss the TSA 3rd Party Test Program and to solicit questions and capability statements from Industry.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of the TSA 3rd Party Test Program</span>: The TSA supports the use of Third Party Testing (TPT) to gain efficiencies and cost savings in the acquisition Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) process as outlined in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acquisition Directive (AD) 102, DHS Management Directive (MD) 26-06, and this TSA Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) T&amp;E Policy. Failures during Qualification Testing (QT) and Operational Testing (OT) have resulted in an iterative cycle of test, fix, and re-test that extends acquisition timelines and drives up the cost of T&amp;E. TSA believes TPT is a key element in streamlining the acquisition process by ensuring system maturity before entering formal T&amp;E. The efficiencies gained by TPT can accelerate implementation schedules, reduce procurement delays, and reduce time-to-deploy. Overall, TSA expects TPT to decrease development and testing costs, and will allow TSA to better allocate constrained resources. The interim strategy will facilitate TSA's goal to standardize and streamline the T&amp;E processing using TPT.</p>

<DESC>Total Small Business Set Aside<br />&nbsp;<br />Convert Circuit 6, Selected Portions, from OH to UG<br /><br />Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, TEXAS<br /><br />WORK TYPE: DESIGN-BUILD / CONSTRUCTION
<p>Provide all site investigations, workplans, site surveys, studies and design analysis, design drawings and specifications, construction documents, shop and manufacturing drawings, materials, labor, equipment, supervision, testing, submittals, and construction to<br />perform the requirements of this project to make the necessary repairs and rehabilitation services in accordance with the provided scope of work and contract documents. The prime contractor shall be required to coordinate with Government Representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, under the direction of the Contracting Officer (KO) and assigned representatives of the contract. Construction shall commence under the direction of the KO after the work plan(s) and associated shop drawings are completed,<br />reviewed, and approved in writing that the workplan(s) and shop drawings have demonstrated they meet the contract requirements. The intent of the project is to replace a section of the Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB)<br />15kV class electrical distribution system (specifically all of Circuit 6). This work includes conversion of overhead (OH) to underground (UG) and replacement of UG electrical primary and secondary service. The finished system shall be 500 kcmil service. Provide the new UG feeder and taps before removing the existing OH and UG feeder and taps to minimize (to the maximum extent possible) the outage(s) associated with replacing Circuit<br />6. Construct the new UG feeder primary and secondary to include street and parking lot lighting. Demolish the existing OH and UG. Existing ground transformers will be replaced as well as main circuit breakers and switches. Work will also require provision of spare underground ducts and provision for metering. Underground road boring with steel casings is required, but pavement cutting will be considered for government approval in specific<br />situations. The design phase shall determine the best method of accomplishing the replacement of this feeder which consists of approximately 3 miles of OH distribution and approximately 3.6 miles of UG distribution. Both the design and the construction shall be handled under the auspices of one prime contractor that shall be responsible for completing the work. It is the prime contractor's option to subcontract the design and/or construction phase as long as the design is<br />stamped by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System' design and the construction is accomplished by a contractor experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' work. The PE that stamps the design shall be the Designer of<br />Record (DOR). The DOR shall submit his or her design experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 documented &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System Modification' projects of similar scope (of which 3 must be designed within the last 5 years). The construction contractor shall submit its construction experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 years documented &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' experience of similar scope (of<br />which 3 must be successfully completed within the last 5 years).<br />The replacement of Circuit 6 shall be accomplished with a minimum of power outage(s). To assist in achieving that requirement, the new UG distribution must be constructed and tested to the maximum extent possible prior to demolishing the existing OH and UG distribution. All outages shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer (KO) in advance and shall be scheduled through the Sheppard AFB Base Civil Engineer (BCE).<br />The principal elements of the project are:<br />1. Perform required site visit(s) to verify work required according to the documents provided<br />2. Design and Workplan developments<br />3. Construction Management<br />4. Overhead Electrical Distribution Demolition<br />5. Underground Electrical Distribution Replacement<br />6. New Underground Electrical Distribution Work<br />7. Street Lighting<br />8. Electrical Transformer and Switch Work<br />9. Utility Trenching and Backfill<br />10. Electrical Utility underground and under road boring<br />11. Materials Hauling<br />12.
