<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, FAX 703-787-1022
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from organizations interested in the STUDY OF BARITE SOLUBILITY AND THE RELEASE OF TRACE COMPONENTS TO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT.  Barite, an ore that is used during the drilling of wells, consists primarily of barium sulfate. However, various trace metals including mercury, cadmium, and other trace elements are contained in the barite ore.  Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates the concentrations of mercury and cadmium in barite to less than 1 part per million and 3 parts per million, respectively.  Although barite is a relatively insoluble substance, there is some concern that at the conditions on the seafloor, some of the barite could dissolve, releasing the trace elements.  These elements could then potentially be available to organisms to bioaccumulate or as toxins.  The degree to which barite dissolves, depends on both the solubility and the rate at which it dissolves.  If the barite dissolves too slowly, it could be buried under recently deposited sediments before release of any trace metals.  Alternately, during early diagenesis, conditions may change resulting in the dissolution of barite.  The availability of the trace metals for bioaccumulation or as toxins also depends on the chemical form of the element.  Presently, it is assumed that in barite, trace elements are present as either sulfides or sulfates.  A direct determination of the chemical forms of trace elements in barite has not been made or is not available in the literature.  Once the barite has been ingested by an organism, the conditions within the gut may also release trace elements from the barite.  Some studies have been conducted to evaluate the release of metals under acidic conditions, such as within a digestive tract, but most of this information is not in readily accessible literature.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO: (1) determine the solubility of barite under the environmental conditions found at the sea floor; (2) determine the amount of trace metals that are released, in particular mercury and cadmium; (3) determine the rate at which the barite dissolves; (4) determine the trace metal species within the barite structure; and (5) evaluate the effects of acidic environments on the solubility of barite and subsequent release of trace metals.  The Period of  Performance of this study shall be eighteen (18) months. Cost of this study is estimated to be between $175,000 and $225,000.  THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF FIVE (5) MAIN TASKS: (1) Laboratory experiments should be conducted to determine the solubility of barite in the marine environment such as is found at the water sediment interface in the Gulf of Mexico.  The barite should be from the same source as that used by the oil and gas industry for drilling mud.  Standard practices for evaluating the solubility should be used; (2) The release of trace metals as the barite ore dissolves under conditions found at the water sediment interface in the Gulf of Mexico should be evaluated.  The trace metals of interest are mercury, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc; (3) The rate of the dissolution of barite under the conditions found at the water sediment interface in the Gulf of Mexico should be evaluated.  Standard methods for the evaluation of dissolution rates should be used; (4) the species of each trace metal in Task 2 within the barite structure should be determined.  Standard methods for making this evaluation should be used. (5) The effects of acidic media such as is found in digestive systems should be evaluated by the use of acidic extraction techniques.   HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform work by providing Capabilities Statements, not later than 5:00 p.m., October 24, 2002,  Detailing: (1) Your key personnel, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility  for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications  and specific expertise and experience.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contemplates award of a contract for planning, and collaborative development and implementation of the protocol for the population-based and qualitative components of the post-intervention evaluation for Diabetes Interventions Reaching and Educating Communities Together (Project DIRECT).  

Project DIRECT is a multi-level approach to reducing the disproportionate burden of diabetes in African Americans.   Project DIRECT is the first comprehensive community based project in the United States to address the growing burden of diabetes in African Americans. The goal of the project is to use existing knowledge of diabetes risk factors and complications to implement community level interventions to reduce the prevalence and severity of diabetes in communities with large African American populations.  The post-intervention population-based survey will be a cross-sectional survey and will be conducted in the intervention community (Raleigh, NC) and the comparison community (Greensboro, NC). The CDC is collaborating with the state of North Carolina to implement and evaluate public health strategies for reducing the burden of diabetes in this predominately African American community.

The contract awardee will be expected to coordinate the planning, and collaborative development of the protocol for the population-based and qualitative components of the post-intervention evaluation; submit this protocol for approval by the institutional review boards (IRB) of the CDC, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHSS) and other organizations as necessary; develop a package for approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); and, implement the protocol.   The awardee will be responsible for data collection, data management, data analysis, and for meeting the reporting requirements of the contract.  More specifically, the awardee will be responsible for evaluating the qualitative and quantitative effects of the three intervention strategies: health promotion, diabetes outreach, and diabetes care improvement.

The period of performance is anticipated to be 36 months; a cost reimbursement type contract is contemplated.  The award type is full and open, under NAICS code 54171.   The solicitation will be posted to the  http://www.fedbizopps.gov website on/about 6/3/02.   A hard copy of the solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>NA BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT  (BAA) DAAH01-02-R-RB04 HIGH EFFICIENCY DISTRIBUTED LIGHTING  HIGH EFFICIENCY DISTRIBUTED LIGHTING SOL:	BAA DAAH01-02-R-RB04, DUE 12 November 2002 POC:	Adina B. Peyton,AMSAM-AC-RD-AY, Building 5400, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898 FAX: 	(256) 876-7600 WEB:	http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm. E-MAIL:	hedlight@dpo.redstone.army.mil  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION DARPA's Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals through AMCOM for innovative concepts relating to the development of High Efficiency Distributed Lighting (HEDLight) including high efficiency full spectrum light sources, coupling optics, op tical-fiber-luminaires, and integrated fiber-illuminators. The program objective is to enable significant reductions in platform vulnerability through the use of remote source lighting, particularly on Naval warships, with a secondary emphasis on enabling improved visual acuity of the warfighter. The technical objective of the program is the demonstration of integrated high efficiency distributed lighting fiber-illuminators characterized by the following series of Integrated Fiber-Illuminator Properties and  Objectives: Electrical Efficiency (LPW): 50 minimum, 70 goal; Mass Efficiency (lumens per gm): 2 minimum, 5 goal; Output (lumens): 1000-5000; Color Point: 5700-6500 K CCT; Spectrum: D57-D65, full spectrum, white; Luminaire: fiber-integrated. To achieve this objective, offerors should emphasize illumination system or subsystem concepts that may contain high technical risk but if enabled would have commensurate high performance payoff. Technical objective goals for the illumination subsystems ar e described in the Proposer Information Pamphlet, which is available at Internet sites referenced elsewhere in this document.  Offerors are invited to submit proposals to one or more of the subsystem and integrated illuminator topic areas described below. Offerors proposing to multiple areas should submit independent proposals to each area. Where synergies between topic areas of w ork would provide greater value to the government, these synergies and their consequent cost or risk mitigations should be called out in the respective proposals. The first phase of the effort proposed (base) should support the technical feasibility of the concept. Offerors should propose follow-on phases leading toward technology development. Based upon the success of the base efforts, a subset of the selected prop osals may have options exercised to initiate the technology development. The BAA and Proposers Information Pamphlet constitute the entire solicitation for this effort. No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development effort be issued.  Requests for such information will be disregarded. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS (1) Full Spectrum Light Sources, (2) Optical Coupling (3) Optical-Fiber-Luminaires, (4) Integrated Fiber-Illuminators. PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING As much as $5M in FY 2003, $6M in FY 2004, and $5M in FY 2005 may be available to fund efforts under this BAA. Multiple awards during FY 2003 are anticipated. GENERAL INFORMATION Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA DAAH01-02-R-RB04 HEDLight (PIP) which provides further information on the above areas of interest, the submission, evaluation and funding processes, proposal formats, submission dates for proposals, and other g eneral information. This pamphlet may be obtained from the World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm, or by fax or electronic mail from the Administrative Contact below. Requests should be sent to the administrative contact given bel ow. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. Proposers must submit an original, five copies, and an electronic copy of the proposal to mailing address provided below. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA DAAH01-02 -R-RB04 P roposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No other formal solicitation regarding this announcement will be issued and requests for such items will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, portions of, or none of the proposals received. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs ) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas  of research in the technologies sought. All administrative correspondences and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the administrative contact below; e-mail is preferred. AMCOM intends to use electronic mail, WWW, and/or fax for correspondence regarding BAA DAAH01-02-R-RB04. Proposals may not be submitted by fax or electronically; any so sent will be disregarded.  EVALUATION CRITERIA The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria. The first three criteria are of equal and primary importance; the remaining criteria are listed in descending order of importance: (l ) Overall scientific and technical merit, (2) Relevance to achieving the technical goals of the HEDLight program, (3) Approach to Technology Transition, (4) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience, and (5) Cost Realism. The PIP and other information related to this announcement may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.

<DESC>NA ACA, White Sands Missile Range intends to award a sole-source contract to M&E Engineering, Inc., for the preparation of a feasibility study for self-generation at five (5) separate substations on White Sands Missile Range.  M&E was the selected subcontract or to perform this work under a GSA Areawide Utility contract, as an energy savings initiative.  The utility is closing its energy saving initiative operations, and it is honoring its previous commitments, but it will not accept the planned work.  The requ irement still exists, but there is not enough time to obtain competition.  M&E is now in a superior position to any one who would now compete against them, for a study that is less than $35,000.  It is the Contracting Officer's judgement to complete the aw ard to M&E on a sole source basis under the authority of the default clause in the areawide contract.  Any contract that may result from this study will not be restricted to M&E.  Note 22.

<DESC>NA ACA, White Sands Missile Range intends to award a sole-source contract to M&E Engineering, Inc., for the preparation of a feasibility study for self-generation at five separate substations on White Sands Missile Range.  M&E was the selected subcontractor t o perform this work under a GSA Areawide Utility contract, as an energy savings initiative.  The utility is closing its energy saving initiative operations, and it is honoring its previous commitments, but it will not accept the planned work.  The requirem ent still exists, but there is not enough time to obtain competition.  M&E is now in a superior position to any one who would now compete against them, for a study that is less than $35,000.  It is the Contracting Officer's judgement to complete the award to M&E on a sole source basis under the authority of the default clause in the areawide contract.  Any contract that may result from this study will not be restricted to M&E.  Note 22.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to develop a three-day training course on Freeway Management and Operations to provide participants with a general appreciation and understanding of the key policies, institutional issues, challenges and barriers, technical, and other issues to consider in the planning, design, implementation, management, operation, evaluation, and marketing of freeway facilities. This new training course will replace NHI course 137075, Freeway Traffic Operations which is currently being offered as either a three or five day course.  This course was developed prior to the development of the National Highway Institutes' guidelines for adult learning and Instructional System Design (ISD), which focuses on the teaching techniques associated with adult learning.   As a result, this new course must incorporate these ISD principles into the new curriculum. The curriculum material to be developed includes an Instructor's Guide, Participant Workbook, Visual Aids, and Student Exercises and Solutions. Performance must comply with Section 508 of the American With Disabilities Act. 

The Freeway Management and Operations Handbook is the technical reference around which this course will be developed.  This reference, which is currently being revised, is an introductory manual that contains chapters on the key areas associated with managing travel and controlling traffic on freeway facilities. The latest information available regarding the revisions that are being made to the Freeway Management and Operations Handbook can be accessed through the FHWA's Office of Travel Management's website at http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/Travel/traffic/freeway_management.htm. 

This is a full and open solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored, however, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements or notifications of postings by e-mail. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to develop a two-day training course on that presents the configuration management (CM) issues and recommended practices for agencies to consider in the planning, development of plans, and preparation for the actual management of travel, control of traffic, and provision of services related to traffic management systems.  CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time. CM involves the policies, procedures, techniques and tools to: manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and to maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes.  CM programs and plans provide the technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes and resources that are required to support a traffic management system.  		

The need for and use of CM plans has increased significantly because of the rapid deployment of ITS projects and the development of traffic management systems.  Many agencies are unaware of the need for, importance, and value of CM programs and plans to the continued operation and maintenance of their systems.  CM standards and recommended practices have been developed and are being used in other industries to successfully plan, design, implement, manage, and maintain complex systems similar to traffic management systems.

The document titled CM for Traffic Management Systems will serve as the technical reference for this course.  The complete draft of this document will be available in August of 2002 with a final version available in the November of 2002.  Individual chapters were made available starting in June of 2002.  This course will be consistent with and follow the structure of the material contained in this document.  The latest information regarding the development of this document as well as current draft chapters available can be accessed through the Traffic Management Center (TMC) Pooled Fund Web Site at:                   http://tmcpfs.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/cfprojects/new_detail.cfm?id=24&new=0.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source contract to Foster Miller, Inc. of Waltham MA for the continued development and support of crawling autonomous vehicles. It is anticipated (based on the results of testing in Spring 03), that CSS will desire to utilize these same vehicles to support autonomous mine neutralization in the Surf Zone (SZ) and Very Shallow Water (VSW) area.  The follow-on neutralization effort will be included as optional tasks in the contract. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: 1). This is a follow-on effort to contract N61331-02-C-0022, with Foster Miller, for the continued development of a highly specialized system within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Award to any other source would result in a substanti al duplication of cost to the Government that could not feasibly be recovered through competition.  2). The SEA Talon autonomous vehicle is based on a design developed by FMI and there is no adequate description of the vehicle design that would allow a competitor to continue development.  3). The purpose of this requirement is to continue the development of the SEA TALON capabilities, integrate different sensor packages on the vehicle, and demonstrate the ability of the vehicle to perform lane reconnaissance and RIN missions in the real world environment. Only Foster Miller, Inc as the incumbent on contract N61331-99-C-0022 has the in-depth knowledge of the vehicle design to successfully accomplish this requirement.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541330.

<DESC>Newsome Channel and Riparian Restoration Feasibility Study - This project will provide a range of conceptual design alternatives for improvement of the Newsome Creek channel and riparian corridor.  The project reach is about 3.5 miles long, the watershed area at the downstream end is about 23 square miles, the valley floor width averages about 200-300 feet, and the bankfull channel width is about 27 feet.  Much of the valley floor through the project reach was dredge mined in the early part of the 20th century.  Instream fish habitat improvement structures were placed in portions of the stream in the 1970s and 1980s.  A system trail, designated for non-motorized access, exists on the valley floor and crosses the stream with fords in several locations.

The objectives of the restoration work are to improve channel morphology, water quality, fish habitat, and riparian conditions.  Anticipated measures to meet the objectives include reconfiguration and/or relocation of the stream channel, reshaping and relocation of mine tailings, reestablishment of floodplains, instream habitat improvement, soil restoration and revegetation.  Public and administrative access must be maintained along Trail #826, which is present along the length of the project area.

The expected product of the feasibility study is a written report displaying two to four alternatives which address these objectives at various levels.  A basic concept for each alternative will be provided by the Forest Service, in cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe and various agencies.  The vendor will provide information on each alternative, including a narrative description, maps, typical drawings, resource benefits and liabilities, and general costs.  The level of information should be adequate to support evaluation of the alternatives through subsequent processes such as environmental disclosure, threatened and and endangered species consultation, and cultural resources clearance.  Key anticipated skill needs include hydrology, hydraulic engineering, fisheries biology, soils, botany and cultural resources.
   
The project area is located in the headwaters of Newsome Creek, approximately 12 air miles northwest of Elk City,  Idaho.  The area is accessed via State Highway 14, then up Forest Road #1858.  The project area begins at the upstream end of the private land boundary at the Newsome Townsite and continues for about 3.5 miles to near the mouth of Radcliffe Creek.  The project area is located in T30N, R7E, Sections 12, 13, 18, 19, and 30, BM.  Project area and vicinity maps will be posted on the Nez Perce National Forest website (www.fs.fed.us/r1/nezperce/).  This notice will be updated with the complete URL when the maps are posted.

A pre-solicitation site visit is planned for October 22, 2002 starting at 0900 PDT.  Meeting location for the tour is at the junction of State Highway 14 and Newsome Creek Road #1858.  This is located at MP 37 on Highway 14, about 12 miles west of Elk City and about 48 miles east of Grangeville, Idaho.  Prospective bidders are responsible for their own transportation, lunches, and field gear.  Waterproof knee-length or hip boots are recommended as there are several stream fords that will be crossed during the tour.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer the following questions: 1.  Who provides the feedthroughs (connections between inside the vacuum and outside the vacuum for controlling the motors)?	 Vacuum feedthroughs shall be included as part of this procurement for the positioning system as necessary.  The vacuum chamber does not yet exist, and will be desinged to account for any feedthroughs provided with the positioning system. 2.	What is the expected delivery time? Delivery of dtailed drawings and schematics is requested within 8-10 weeks of contract award, so that the vacuum chamber can be designed to incorporate necessary features and feedthroughs.  The positioning system hardware and controls is requested to be delivered withing 7 months of contract award. 3.  What is the metal vapor that is referred to in the specification? The metal vapor is residual from the electron beam freeform fabrication process.  The chemistry of the vapor will depend upon the alloy being processed.  Current plans include aluminum, titanium, steel, and nickel-based alloys, and may also include high melting point materials such as tungsten or rhenium.	The system should be designed to protect from contamination of any type.  If the materials used for the positioning system will preclude processing of specific metal(s) due to the potential for damaging interactions, the precluded process metal(s) shall be identified in the proposal.

The site visits have been scheduled at the following times and place:  Date: September 30, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.; Date: October 1, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.;  Location:  Bureau of Engraving & Printing, 13th Street (between C and D Streets), SW, Washington, DC  20228-0001.  Due to the closure of the BEP?s 14th Street entrance all conference participants must access the BEP at the 13th & C Street entrance.  Interested parties are required to submit the names of the individuals that plan to attend not later than 24 hours prior to the date and time of the conference.  As the site visit on September 30, 2002 is a Monday, offerors must submit their request no later than Friday, September 27, 2002 by 4:00 p.m.  This time constraint is required due to security reasons.  Submission or substitutions to the names of the individuals attending may not be changed after the 24- hour time limitation.  Offeror?s are limited to a maximum of two (2) representatives from each firm due to  limited space availability for each site visit.  Due to limited time and security constraints an offeror may attend only one site visit.  These limitations are to ensure that all prospective offerors that request a site visit will be given an opportunity to attend.  The Government will try to accommodate the offeror?s request for one of the specified site visit dates, if possible.  Interested parties are to submit their company?s name, name(s) of individual(s) and their title that are planning to attend, and a point of contact including their phone number.  This information must be submitted in writing to Larry McCain, Contract Specialist at the following email address: larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov/.  The duration of time for the site visit will be determined at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist.  Individuals attending the conference must provide picture identification (e.g., drivers license or passport) and should arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the conference start time to allow for processing through security.  Additional dates for site visits will only be established if both site visit dates are full and the offeror?s request for site visit was submitted 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  Additional site visits will not be scheduled due to an offeror?s inability to attend the scheduled visits or due to an offeror?s failure to submit their request to attend a site visit 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  This site visit is optional.  In no event shall failure to visit the delivery site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.

<DESC>Stand alone public address system.  The Foreign Service Institute has a requirement for a two-way public address/intercom system to be designed and installed at the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center at 4000 Arlington Boulevard, Arlington, VA.  The system would be used for training related purposes such as making public announcements to staff and students related to events that impact the classes and as a means of communication related to requests for help in classroom setups or technology or equipment located in the classrooms,  The system should be state of the art and must be able to broadcast to a single location or to all locations independently or together.  The system must be robust enough to carry announcements to all identified buildings and to receive information from designated classrooms in those buildings.  The system must be able to be expanded since there will be additional construction at the Shultz Center to be completed by 2006 and the system must be able to be expanded into that new space.  The public address/intercom system will be a separate system and will not be connected to the Center's existing fire/emergency system.  It will not be used for emergency notification purposes and will not be used for emergency evacuation purposes.  Installation of the system must be separate from areas and must not have any impact on the existing fire/emergency system network and wiring.

There will be a site survey on campus so that vendors may determine sonic characteristics for appropriate number and placement of speakers throughout the facility and determine best technical solutions for both public address and two-way intercom applications.  Site survey will be July 31st at 10:00am.  Interested vendors must email the name, date of birth, and social security numbers of those who plan to attend by July 26th.  Additional names can be received no later than July 30th.  This information should be sent to lewisce@state.gov..

36. How do you want to handle post-installation maintenance requirements?
We intend to initiate a maintenance contract.

37. Do you want requirements coming back to you as paper or CAD?
Paper.

38. Would you consider doing this any other way than firm fixed price?
No.

39. If contractor employees have a DOD security clearance, do they need escorts?
There will be a Department of State escort for contractor employees.

40. Will you accept phase/building acceptance?
Yes.

41. What type of PBX do you have?
Not applicable.  We want a stand alone system.
 
42. Will you lay out the zones on the drawings?
Yes ? see question 6.

43. Clarify whether wiring is plenium or non-plenium.
We have both plenium and non-plenium wiring.

44. Space for project manager during duration of job
No.

45. Can we drop ship parts to your warehouse?
Yes, but we will need advance notification.

46. Can they place a dumpster and trailer on the grounds?
The trailer and dumpster may be some distance from the buildings you are working on.

47. Any requirements for marking of cables?
Cables should be marked on each end.

<DESC>This action originally publicized in fedbizopps dated 14 September 2002, is amended as follows to answer the following questions.  Question 1.  Please clarify and define the pricing unit to be quoted for USZA92-02-Q-0025 (Oct 2002 Airsupport).  Is the unit intended to be per "clock hour" or per "flight hour"  Answer 1: The Government anticipated the contractors to price per flight hour.  However, this is a commercial item solicitation and the Government will evaluate and consider alternate pricing, based on the contractor's commercial standard.  The Government does require the contractor to specify the unit of measure used to price the service.    Question 2.  With regard to pricing, do you require a FFP bid to cover the month or will you accept a turnkey per flight hour cost?  Answer 2.  The Government anticipated a flight hour price schedule.   Question 3.  The format is not specified, but at para 17xvi you have requested "information on types and quantities for each flight operation identified."  Do you want to use 17vi # 3 - Operations, or 17vi # 10 - Mission Tasks as the outline?  Answer 3.  We will evaluate any pricing schedule, we anticipated you using # 3 which identified specific operations.  Question 4.  Performance:  The FAA compliance requirement is stated to be part 91 with a few portions of the mission part 135.  It is not clear whether the 135 portion of the mission requires standard 135 approved passenger seating or part 91 folding jump seating.  Can you clarify the seating requirement for the 135 portion of the mission?  Answer 4. There will not be a requirement for 135 seating for any of these missions. The part 91 seating is all that is required.  Question 5.  Will the contractor be required to RON or travel away from the Ft Bragg area in the performance of this contract?  Answer 5. The contractor will not be required to RON or travel away from the Ft Bragg area. These missions will all be in and around Ft Bragg and the Uhwarrie forest.  Question 6.  The radio communication requirement for the aircraft to be able to speak to personnel on the ground is not clear.  Is VHF only communication acceptable?  Answer 6. Usually the commo equipment used is both FM and VHF.  Question 7.  Para 17vi # 3 - Operations, identifies several missions and mission scenarios.  Will any of the missions be performed simultaneously - requiring more than one aircraft?  Answer 7. There will be no missions performed simultaneously requiring more than one aircraft. the only requirement for two aircraft will be on 10 Oct to cover an airborne operations with 300 jumpers.  Question 8.  Para 17vi # 9 - Mission Notice, puts the contractor on notice that additional missions may be requested.  Does the Government want a guaranteed standby aircraft and crew to fulfill this requirement?  Answer 8. No - We anticipate other opportunities, and hope the winning contractor will be available for short notice requirements.  Question 9.  What are the performance clauses the Government will use in the actual contract and are there penalties or liquidated damages associated?  Answer 9.  All the clauses were included in the solicitation, no liquidated damages are associated.   The date and time for receipt of quotes is changed - reference the RFQ number USZA92-02-Q-0025 and submit no later than 12:00 p.m. 27 September 2002, to Karen Glass at FAX (910) 432-9345.

<DESC>NA TITLE:	Radio Frequency (RF) Tags Market Survey DESCRIPTION: This is a request for information only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The US Army CECOM RDEC is seeking sources and information regarding either an analog or digital RF Tags to uplink data from ground forces to an airborne SAR/GMTI radar platf orm.   RF Tags are being sought to participate in an Army C4ISR Demonstration in January 2004.  The RF Tags shall be utilized as a locality indicator (embedded in modulated radar return) and objectively as high bandwidth data nodes.  They shall be fully pr ogrammable across several radars, modes, and missions.  Because multiple tags will be used in proximity with one another, issues pertaining to co site interference and Tag distinction must be considered.  A Low Probability of Interception (LPI) must be inc orporated into the Tags design.  In addition, Tags power consumption must be at a minimum while still performing at optimum levels.

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Silver Spring, Maryland is seeking sources for a planned acquisition of real-time lightning strike information and detection system status information (collectively called "data" or "lightning data").  At a minimum any vendor responding to this Sources Sought must have an established CONUS lightning data network capable of meeting the stated detection and location accuracy requirements by the date of contract issuance.  NOAA/NWS will be the lead agency for this acquisition.  Other agencies receiving data under this acquisition include, but are not limited to the; Department of Transportation, Department of Interior, Department of Defense, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Users of the data include agency field sites, research organizations, and administration offices.  Some of the agencies will disseminate data to other government agencies (federal, state and local).

The Government needs cloud-to-ground lightning data and total lightning data (total lightning includes cloud-to-ground, cloud-to-cloud, and in-cloud data).  Vendors responding to this sources sought need to state their network's capabilities.  The government requires that the vendor's network be capable of detecting 99% of all lightning strikes over the CONUS and up to 80% of all strikes over other areas.  Lightning strike locations must be reported to the nearest second of latitude and longitude.  The location accuracy must be within 0.5 km.  The time of the occurrence must be reported to the nearest 0.001 second.

Government agencies will have the option to receive data directly from the vendor, through the NWS' Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG), through NOAAPORT, through the Internet or through an intermediate contractor.  The agencies will also have the option to obtain vendor-produced display hardware and software, the vendor's archived data and any available vendor generated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products.  The Government reserves the right to archive lightning data issued via NOAAPORT or the NWSTG.

Lightning data is needed from terrestrial and marine areas.  The Terrestrial Areas include the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Antartic.  The Marine areas include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Carribean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, Indian Ocean, Artic Ocean, and Southern Ocean.

<DESC>1.0 This is a market survey by the Navy Unmanned Air Vehicles Program Office (PMA-263) of the Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation [PEO (W)].  It is intended to determine the existence of sources that have demonstrated the capability to design, build, and manufacture a UAV and sensors capable of performing the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV mission. The BAMS UAV will address the Long-Dwell Standoff Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission area of the Naval UAV Strategy. Currently, the BAMS UAV Program is planned to enter at the Milestone B (MS B) Phase of the acquisition process System Development and Design (SSD) in FY-04 with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) being achieved in FY-08.  As a result, the program office is considering various acquisition strategies for all aspects of a BAMS UAV system architecture including platforms, sensors and ground systems to include commercial/Non Developmental Item (NDI), competitive design or a competitive system integrator.  The following constraints apply to the BAMS UAV system:

	a.	Address mission areas such as Maritime Patrol, Strike Targeting, Port Security, Level IV UAV control aboard Aircraft Carrier and Large Deck Amphibious ships and integration with P-3/MMA;  
	b.	Not be armed;
c.	Remain at cruise altitude for mission duration, unless range and endurance can be met with altitude excursions;
	d.	Be able to carry multiple sensors; 
	e.	Not use underwater sound as a primary sensing technique;
	f.	Use Tactical Control System (TCS) as the core of the ground control element;
	g.	Integrate ground control element functionality into the P-3 Tactical Support Center (TSC) and into the Carrier and Amphibious ship infrastructure;
	h.	Be able to complete its mission as a stand-alone platform, in support of a manned aircraft, and with Carrier and Amphibious ship operations.  

2.0	Sensors and air vehicle alternatives meeting the above criteria should be discussed in the response to this RFI.   Respondents are requested to address the following:

a.	Concepts for meeting BAMS mission areas.  Concepts may describe the system and approach, including but not limited to platforms, sensors, C3, costs, and system integration of BAMS UAV components.  Descriptions should include physical and performance characteristics;
b.	Modifications to proposed concepts that might be required to meet projected mission requirements;
c.	Impacts on the proposed BAMS systems concept due to the integration of the Government developed/provided components (e.g. TCS, Common Data Link, etc);
d.	Recommendations for acquisition approaches, including estimates of cost and schedule for the BAMS UAV Program through SDD completion and through production that supports an IOC in FY-08;
e.	Logistics philosophy;
f.	Related experience and products;
g.	Production capability for systems, per year.
h.	Open System Architecture approach to allow for reduced integration efforts with future payloads.
i.	Innovative ideas on reducing manpower requirements and communication bandwidth through use of autonomous operations and other technologies.  An example would be for TCS level IV control with no more than two operators and the ability to use the Tactical Common Data Link to transmit and receive full BAMS air vehicle and sensors information.
j.	Innovative ideas for completing mission, such as being capable of carrying and launching smaller UAVs

3.0	Any technical questions may be directed to Mr. Keith Carter, (301) 757-5869 and programmatic questions to Mr. Rich Klesser, (301) 757-5879 or LCDR Mike Schachterle, (301) 757-5855.  Additional information related to the BAMS UAV Program may be found on the PMA-263 web-site http://uav.navair.navy.mil.   Written inputs are due not later than 28 October 2002 to the Program Executive Office, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PMA-263), Bldg 2272, Suite 256, 47123 Buse Road Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, ATTN: Mike McLoughlin. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.

4.0 	Additionally, a number of other on-going efforts are underway in support of the BAMS UAV acquisition effort.  These efforts include development of a CONOPS, Initial Operational Requirements (IRD) (draft IRD available for industry review late CY-02) and an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  An AoA is required at Milestone B (MS B) for entry into the SSD acquisition phase.  The principal objectives of the AoA are to:

a.	Investigate sensor configurations that fulfill BAMS UAV projected missions, specifically ISR of maritime and land targets, strike support, Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) collection and geo-location, and communications relay.

b. 	 Examine UAV air vehicle alternatives that support accomplishment of BAMS UAV missions. 

5.0	The resulting AoA will provide sufficient information to assess the characteristics and performance parameters of the BAMS UAV system.  The following assumptions were given to the AoA team to guide the analysis.  The BAMS UAV will:

a.	Not be armed,
b.	Be expected to remain at cruise altitude for mission duration,
c.	Be a multi-INT capable platform, and not be single-INT specific, and 
d. 	Not use underwater sound as a primary sensing technique.   

6.0   Additionally, the following constraints were given to the AoA team.  The BAMS UAV:

a.   	Must achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by FY08, 
b.   	Must integrate the ground element with the Tactical Control System (TCS) as well as the use of the TCS integrated into the P-3 Tactical Support Center (TSC) and TCS integrated with the Carrier and Amphibious ship infrastructure, and
c. 	 Must be able to complete its mission as a stand-alone platform, in support of a manned aircraft, and with Carrier and Amphibious ship operations.  

7.0  MITRE Corporation been selected to lead the analysis for the AoA.  In addition to inputs to the government as delineated in paragraphs 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 above, all interested parties are encouraged to contact MITRE and provide the team with the information relevant to the AoA to have their products considered.  Email POC for the Analysis of Alternatives is BAMSAOA@mitre.org.

<DESC>The Okanogan & Wenatchee National Forests has a requirement to acquire the services of a site operator at the Little Buck Mountain IMPROVE Air Quality Monitoring Site.  The site operator must travel to the site weekly on Tuesday, regardless of weather, by whatever means is necessary, to change the filter samples from each of the four modules in the air quality sampling system.  The site operator must collect the filter samples in a way to insure they do not become contaminated and package them for mailing to the University of California at Davis (UC Davis).  At the time this is done, the operator must do an inspection of the equipment to insure everything is functional and there are no problems evident that would compromise the quality of the data that is collected.  The site operator must coordinate and communicate with the Crocker Nuclear Lab at UC Davis to trouble shoot any potential problems and to perform maintenance on the equipment if needed.  The operator also must maintain a digital camera site at the same location and coordinate that work with Air Resource Specialists in Ft. Collins, CO, and periodically forwards a computer disk with archived digital camera data.  This task also involves periodic maintenance on the camera and associated power supply.  The site operator shall provide their own transportation and cell phone or other communication device for use at the site while performing services, tools and incidentals necessary to do the maintenance.  The Government will furnish the air filters, digital camera film, and mailing packages with prepaid postage.  It is the Governments intent to award a single source three year contract, in one year increments, for these services using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ron Mackie, 2 Mundinger Lane, Omak, WA, 98841.  Mr. Mackie is the incumbent contractor.  Mr. Mackie has been very reliable and able under sometimes very trying circumstances to travel to the site without fail.  Mr. Mackie has excellent attention to detail and his performance has been outstanding with no site operator caused data loss.  Mr. Mackie has access to several modes of transportation to get to the site in inclement weather.  The first contract year would be awarded with the renewal of the contract for each succeeding year will be based on:  (1) satisfactory performance, (2) determination that the price is still the best value to the Governemnt and (3) availability of funding.   No solicitation will be issued.   All interested offerors may  provide information which will permit evaluation of your capabilities to perform this service.  The point of contact and contracting office is shown elsewhere in this announcement.

Location and Accessibility.  The monitoring site is located west of the top of the ski lift on the Loup Loup Ski Hill.  The Loup Loup Ski Area is located 15 miles west of Okanogan, WA, on State Highway 20.  Access to the monitoring site will require some means of reaching the top of the mountain.  There is approximately one and one-half miles of 70 percent slope at the top that makes it very difficult to access the site.  During the summer months access may be made by 4 wheel drive or ATV on a very rough service road, this road is not maintained by the Government.  During winter months some other means of access will be required such as the use of snowshoes, snowmobile, ski lift pass, etc.  The winter time access cannot conflict with the special use permit for this area and that may mean no snowmobile use on this area when the ski hill is open.  If snowmobile use is allowed, care and concern for the trail will be required.  Travel access to the site must be done with the least minimum impact to prevent erosion problems. There will be times of the year, for example spring thaw, that the only access may be by foot due to ground conditions.

The Digital Video Systems Development (DVSD) program was initiated to advance and integrate telecommunications, computer system technologies, optics, sensors, cameras, tracking, archival systems, and related instrumentation associated with digital image acquisition.  The products derived from DVSD will increase the efficiency of image acquisition, analysis, distribution and archiving at DoD T&E ranges.

The BAA Announcement can be accessed via the website address: http://www.stricom.army.mil/STRICOM/BAA.  Additional reference material regarding the tri-services program may also be made available as attachments to this BAA announcement.  

Selected research areas of interest for the DVSD shall include the following:

Task 1: The objective of this study effort shall be to identify and analyze real-time objective tracking algorithms that can be implemented in the camera front end in order to improve data capture while maintaining the data integrity for post processing validation.

 The contractor shall identify algorithms that improve real-time object tracking at the imaging front end (to improve the overall quality of the data at the down-stream analysis point).  The analysis should assess the applicability of post processing techniques to improve the real-time tracking algorithms as a means of improving collected image quality. 

Task 2: The objective of this study effort shall be to investigate and analyze various compression techniques such that, if implemented, would allow the system architecture to permit high-speed transmission and storage of imagery data.  Along with a recommendation for real-time vs. non-real time implementation, a cost-benefit analysis and feasibility report should be generated to address, at a minimum, the data rates up to those listed below (for real-time compression).

The development of high speed and high-resolution digital cameras using Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)- based image sensors create a new set of data handling challenges. The amount of data generated by a high performance digital camera may prove to be the limiting factor in its practical utility unless techniques can be developed that will minimize the impact of the mass quantity of data that will be generated.  To illustrate the magnitude of the problem, Figure 1 lists examples of the approximate raw data rates from planned CMOS cameras:


Figure 1:  Representative Digital Camera Data Rates: Pixel Density 512x512, Frame Rate 5000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 12 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 512x256, Frame Rate 10000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 12 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 1024x1024, Frame Rate 1000 fps, Digitization 8, Data Rate 8 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 1280x1024, Frame Rate 500 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 10 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 2048x2048, Frame Rate 500 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 20 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 3072x3072, Frame Rate 200 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 18 Gbits per second; Pixel Density 4096x4096, Frame Rate 200 fps, Digitization 10, Data Rate 32 Gbits per second.  

Figure 1 demonstrates how raw data rates generated by high performance digital cameras exceed most conventional transmission media, protocol, or storage systems. In some cases, the captured imagery data may need to be compressed in real-time with consideration to developing co-processor architecture resident with the CMOS sensor.  In other cases, compression can take place after the capture event occurs.

Examples of some of functions that may need to be considered for real-time, near real-time and non-real time compression techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Region of Interest (ROI) Change
- ROI Location in Image
- ROI Size
- Numbers of Objects and Tagging
- Decompress Object X
- Decompress Area of Interest
- Pick Frame
- Designation of Multiple ROIs for Lossless or Less "Lossy" Compression than Surrounding Regions not Designated
- Compression/Decompression Functions Assignable to ROIs with Measurable and Controllable Effects of any "Lossy" Compression on Image Quality for Post-Test Analysis 
- Designation of Digital Video Frame Intervals of Interest and Time Intervals of Interest Based on Real-Time Manual Entries and Event Signal Inputs (for Interval Start/Stop Control)


Task 3. The objective of this study effort shall be to develop and deliver a Technology Roadmap that reports on the recent historical trends in DVSD technology and related areas as well as identifies the potential for advancement and implementation of new technologies based on those trends. 

The study shall focus on sensors and cameras, lenses, data transmission infrastructure, real-time data storage, data archival, data analysis and all the related technologies (i.e., digital media, disc storage and retrieval rates, computer bus and I/O rates.) for the DOD T&E Ranges. The DVSD Technology Roadmap shall report on the recent trends of the technologies associated with the program, as well as the advancement of those technologies looking at least 10 years into the future.  This data will be used to provide an overall timeline of what to expect in the near future so that program development dollars can be applied more efficiently.


White Papers should address part or all of the specific areas of interest outlined above under the major T&E research thrust as described in the BAA.  White Papers should include, as a minimum, a task description, technical approach, research goals, product/reports to be delivered, a schedule, risk assessment and estimated costs.  White Papers should not exceed 10 pages, exclusive of the cover letter. Estimated period of performance is 6-12 months. This DVSD BAA initial Phase I announcement is provided for the purpose of soliciting White Papers to be evaluated for selection for later Phase II Request for Proposals (RFPs).   Contractors whose White Papers are submitted by the closing date below and are chosen as best meeting or supporting the Government's research needs, will be asked to provide a formal Technical and Cost proposal in Phase II of the DVSD BAA process. RFP requests to contractors may address all or a part or portion of the White Papers presented for evaluation in Phase I.  After the Government has received and evaluated proposals requested in Phase II, the Government intends to make one or more awards to address the research requirements as specified above.  Recommendation for contract type with White Paper submittals is welcomed; however, it is anticipated that contract awards will be made on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis. Contractors are also placed on notice that Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) may be required to meet the total DVSD research requirements.  Government purpose rights are requested.  Several Government-sponsored support contractors will be involved in the evaluation of the White Papers. Specifically, Advanced Systems Technology, Inc., Mevatec Corp and Veridian, Inc. will be participating in the evaluations.  The Government-sponsored support contractors will be required to sign Nondisclosure Agreements and Statements of Financial Interest with the Government.  Unless an objection to the use of a support contractor is received by this activity, consent is given by the submittal of your White Paper.  Final awards resulting from this announcement will take the form of a basic contract in accordance with the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  White Papers shall be submitted to Mr. Milton Washington, Contract Specialist STRICOM, Code 25361, in hard copy or via email at Milt_Washington@stricom.army.mil. Electronic submittals are encouraged.  White papers must be received NLT COB Friday 25 October 2002.  POC for this White Paper Request is Milton Washington at (407) 381-8854.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplement with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Reference number for request for quote (RFQ) is F13OTJ22031200.

This solicitation is for Quantum Learning Instructional CD's for Distance Learning.  Statement of work is as follows: The purpose of this project is to create an AFJROTC distance-learning course of study based on National Academy of Integrative Learning, Inc. (NAIL) Quantum Learning comparable in content, quality and graphics to the program of study developed by the Army.  While the message of the instructional strategies is valid, supported by research, and applicable to the entire secondary school environment, the extensive use of images of Army JROTC instructors and cadets tends to promote these concepts as an Army JROTC program thereby rendering it less valid for use by others, including AFJROTC.

At a minimum, this product must include the following in an organizational design which provides for both initial training and future reference: Movies:  1. Quantum Learning Intro Movie 2. Secrets of Learning Movie 3. Explore Your Styles Movie 4. Brain Structure and Function Movie 5. Triune Brain Movie 6. Downshifting vs. Whole Brain Activation Movie 7. Map vs. Route Learning Movie 8. Creativity Movie 9. Multiple Intelligences Movie 10. Interpersonal Movie 11. Discover the Diversity of Learners Movie 12. Learning Styles Movie 13. Types of Learners Movie 14. Profiles of High vs. Low Performers Movie 15. Left Brain vs. Right Brain Dominance Movie 16. Paul Movie 17. Mary Movie 18. Martha Movie 19. BLC Movie 20. Climate and Culture Movie 21. CIMMBRS Movie 22. Balance of Responsibilities Movie 23.  Heart to Heart Talks Movie 24.  Ergonomics Movie 25. Stress Reduction Movie' 26. Essential Tools Movie 26.  Essential Tools Movie 27. Emotional Tools Movie 28. Activating Tools movie 
Graphics: 1. Balance of Responsibilities - Think on this! 2. Heart to Heart Talks - Think on this! 3. Story Telling Think on this! 4. Positive Attitude 5. Dress 6. Redundant Themes 7. Think and Listen Method 8. Turning over teaching to the class Web links: 1. Quantum Learning Exercise on AFJROTC web site 2. Formative Evaluation Exercise (self-scoring) on the AJROTC Web site.  
Approach: Contractor will need to develop a program of study which is validated and then present that program of study via CD using a variety of streaming video, still photography, graphic art, text, narration, navigation tools, and menus.  All images, text, etc. will need to reflect AFJROTC as the dominant image with images relating to the course materials.  No existing images are available.
