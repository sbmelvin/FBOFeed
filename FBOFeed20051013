<DESC>The following description summarizes the scope of work for backfill and associated activities regarding the 116-N-1 Crib and Trench.

The 116-N-1 Crib and Trench was recently remediated by removing contaminated materials to meet the cleanup criteria.  The resulting excavation will be backfilled as a result of this Subcontract.  The approximate excavation dimensions are 600 meters by 60 meters, to varying depths.  

The finished backfill has been designed in such a way as to closely resemble the surrounding area, to include shallow rolling hills, referred to as “mooli mooli”.  

A majority of the material necessary to backfill the excavation will come from an existing borrow pit area immediately West of the 100N Area, accessible to off-road trucks.  A small fraction will come from an area immediately adjacent to the 116-N-1 Trench and Crib existing excavation.  

The material used in the backfill is non-radiological, however the current radiological posting of the area to be backfilled is Radiation Area, Contamination Area, and High Contamination area.  In the recent past this area has also been a High Radiation Area and an Airborne Radiation Area.  Work in the immediate area of contaminated soils will be necessary as clean backfill soils are used to fill in the waste site.

The estimated subcontract value for this work is between 1 and 3 million dollars.  Following award, mobilization, submittals, and readiness assessment, field work is anticipated to require 5 to 9 months.

OTHER INFORMATION

Potential bidders will be required to complete a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire, available on http://www.washingtonclosure.com/procure/90-day.html and be pre-qualified by WCH.  

A job site walk-down will be required for potential bidders.  Participants must be able to meet applicable DOE requirements for site access.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the US Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.   Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that US Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns the interested party is encouraged to contact the US Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in wiring, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protest fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (CG-85), 2100 2nd street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE – NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS – It is the policy of the US Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the US Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.   Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that US Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns the interested party is encouraged to contact the US Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in wiring, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protest fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (CG-85), 2100 2nd street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593.  Telephone (202) 267-2285, FAX (202) 267-4011, ATTENTION:  OMBUDSMAN

Provisional Moderate-Term Housing

2.0	REQUIRING ORGANIZATION
TSA National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program (NEDCTP)

3.0	 INTRODUCTION
Acquisition of provisional moderate-term housing for up to 108 civilian police officers (trainees) per year while the officers attend 10-week NEDCTP courses located at Lackland Air Force Base.  Each 10-week course has 12 police officers attending (requiring 6 two bedroom units).  This housing should be located within a 10-mile driving distance of Lackland Air Force Base and should include gaited security.  Apartments should be thoroughly cleaned with house wares and linen exchanged every 10 weeks (Friday through Sunday).  All NEDCTP courses graduate on Fridays with new trainees arriving the following Sunday (Monday, when US holidays are on the following Monday).  Apartments need to be ready for move-in on Sunday (Monday in some cases) afternoon for arrivals.

4.0	SCOPE
Two bedroom/two bath apartments (non-negotiable), living area (shared), full kitchen (shared) to include all appliances and a study (desired) with accommodations for a laptop computer.

5.0	BACKGROUND
The NEDCTP has provided this training to police officers through an Interservice Support Agreement with Lackland Air Force Base for over 30 years.  In recent years, the NEDCTP has grown significantly, to the extent that housing civilian police officers through the Base Billeting Office with the increased number of civilian police officers attending NEDCTP courses has been a cumbersome effort at best.  Additionally, due to the length of the course (10-weeks), often the Base Billeting Office had to move NEDCTP trainees several times throughout the course to meet the billeting requirements for military personnel (obviously their first priority).    

6.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
None.

7.0	DELIVERABLES

7.1	Delivery Schedule
The NEDCTP, TSA Support Branch located at Lackland Air Force Base, will provide requirements for upcoming calendar years NLT October 1st of the preceding year.  The TSA Support Branch will confirm lodging requirements and provide a list of course attendees NLT 30-days prior to the class start dates.  Each course attendee will vacate the apartment NLT 0800 on graduation days.

7.2	Delivery Instructions
The contractor will determine availability of units for the requested time periods upon receiving notification from the NEDCTP.  Make required reservations and provide the confirmation numbers for each unit assigned.  Provide move-in instructions within 7 days of the scheduled move-in date.  Obtain personal/department credit cards from all trainees to cover any incidental costs or damages to the apartments.  TSA will only be responsible for the rent on the units.  Provide residents with property and key access to apartment dwellings.  Provide an orientation to all trainees (normally on the first day of class) to include rules and regulations of the property.  Annually, usually at the end of December, refurbish apartments used by the NEDCTP

7.3	Reports and Meetings
None

8.0	PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY PERIOD
NEDCTP courses are scheduled by calendar years, usually beginning on the first workday of January and ending the second or third Friday in December.  There are no trainees requiring apartments over the holiday break through the end of December.


9.0	PLACE/LOCATION OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY
Apartment (gaited) complex within 10 miles of Lackland Air Force Base

10.0	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using ‘Best Value’ criteria per FAR 15.101-2, Technically Acceptable/Lowest Price.

The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the CLIN required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.  APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.  Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centraliz!  es and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer.  To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.  The questionnaire is to help y!  ou gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is  not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.   Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM respectively.

<CONTACT>Gerald Sorrell 850-235-5328 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL, (NSWC PC) intends to solicit competitive proposals for the design and fabrication of a high performance lift fan system for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) based on a performance specification to be provided by the Navy.  This requirement will be fulfilled using full and open competition. The high performance lift fan basically consists of the rotor and bellmouth assembly and will be designed for efficient operation in the present LCAC volute. There will be three major requirements for the high performance lift fan system; (1) increased aerodynamic fan efficiency, (2) reduced maintenance cost and time, and (3) reduced weight, compared to the existing LCAC lift fan system.  Quantified goals and threshold values for the three requirements shall be provided in the RFP.  In order to meet these requirements, a combination of innovative designs, advanced materials, and fabrication and assembly methods may be required.  A new lift fan system that meets these requirements will result in an improved range, increased payload capacity and the reduced life-cycle cost of future and, potentially existing assault connectors. The Government may potentially award multiple contracts as a result of the RFP subject to availability of funding. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 336413 applies. FSC is 2835.  To request the RFP e-mail to gerald.sorrell@navy.mil. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management, under the procedures of FAR Part 15, is seeking both private and public sector offerors to provide services supporting the EPA Office of the Chief Financial Officer?s Financial System Modernization Project (FSMP).  EPA will use a single-stage acquisition that includes three elements?software, integration, and hosting to meet its financial system modernization needs. Consistent with the Financial Management Line of Business initiative under the President's Management Agenda, EPA will consider Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated Centers of Excellence (COE) for Financial Management as well as private sector providers under the terms of a single solicitation as part of its best value determination for this requirement. Centers of Excellence are limited to the Department of Transportation, Department of the Interior's National Business Center, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt.   The procurement will be conducted under full and open competition.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541512.  The size standard is $21 million in average annual revenues.   The Government envisions award of an indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract if a private source is determined to be the best value to the Government based upon proposals received.  If a public COE is determined to be the best value to the Government, the solicitation will be canceled and an interagency agreement (IAG) will be issued. The Government envisions the resultant contract or IAG will be of a hybrid type, allowing for the issuance of firm-fixed-price or fixed-rate task orders depending on the Government?s assessment of the nature of the specific services required and the level of risk inherent in performance at the time of task order issuance.  The Government envisions award of a contract or IAG with a maximum term of ten (10) years.  The solicitation, Statement of Objectives, amendments (if any) and other related information will be made publicly available via the Internet at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/fsmp/index.htm.  Draft documents and reference materials made available on the website prior to solicitation issuance are for informational purposes only and are subject to revision.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of California at Davis, Center for Health and the Environment, Davis, CA  95616,  for conducting an in vitro assay.  The study will involve bromodichloromethane in human trophoblast cells to determine effects on placental secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone and pregnancy associated plasma protein A and concentrated tap water in human differentiated and undifferentiated trophoblast cells to determine effects on placental cell function.  EPA believes that the Center for Health and the Environment is the only source capable of providing the in vitro assay  because of their research experience with human trophoblast cultures and early pregnancy loss and their development of the in vitro assay system using human trophoblast cells to screen potential environmental hazards to early pregnancy.  Based on EPA's knowledge,  the Center for Health and the Environment is the only source currently using this system for toxicity assays.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 13-106-1(b), "Only one source is reasonably available" and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12 months from date of award.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a small business size standard of 500 employees, is applicable.  The intent of this synopsis is to  determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

The Institute of Museum and Library Services invites proposals for an analysis of its grants in the area of youth development services that will include undertaking a survey of grants focusing on youth development, and developing case studies of approximately 15 selected grants.  The year-long study includes data gathering from IMLS grantees, but does not entail original research.  The study should synthesize research on youth development programs at museums and libraries through a literature review and by placing the findings in the context of existing nationwide research, making recommendations, and identifying criteria for best practices. The successful recipient of the contract resulting from this solicitation (Contractor) will work closely with a planning committee that will include researchers, educators, funders, policy makers, and practitioners.  It is expected that the planning committee will meet as a group near the beginning of the contract period, that members of the committee will also meet twice together with the grantees selected for the case studies, and that the planning committee will review and comment on the final report.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Navy to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a requirement for upgrading of the Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) engineering test asset (a.k.a. ARPDD Brassboard system) with hardware capable of supporting an upgraded version of a Government developed discriminator software.  This engineering asset requires hardware and software modifications to accommodate communication and processing ‘through puts’ for proper functioning of the discriminator software.  Additionally required are radar technology risk reduction developments that address identified risks from a Government Technology Readiness Assessment for ASW radar’s with ARPDD capabilities.  Required risk reduction developments in this area include development of a digital wideband receiver for an APS-137 radar, an upgraded automatic detector for a proposed ARPDD mode, development of an integrated high-speed processing system for the discriminator subsystem. Integration of these developments into the ARPDD Brassboard system and test of all of these components including the Government’s discriminator software.  The modifications should be carried out using an open system architecture for hardware and software that supports future system growth.  The contractor should maximize the use of commercial off the shelf technologies and select such technologies so that obsolescence is minimized.  Minimal documentation exists for the developed Brassboard system and software discriminator.  No level III engineering drawings or documents are owned by the Government for the Brassboard system that includes the APS-137 and discriminator subsystems.  All work is required to be performed in a classified setting and meet all Government security requirements for data items and hardware identified as SECRET.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on 21 October 2005, and should not exceed 5 one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point, to the following address:  For first class mail NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND Attn: Ann Smetana, 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, B2272, R155, Patuxent River, MD  20670.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence and Construction Excellence Programs seek to commission our nation’s most talented designers, architects, engineers and constructors to design and build federal buildings of high quality and outstanding value.

<SUBJECT>61--Sources Sought - New Family of Power Distribution Equipment Capable of Transmitting Electrical Power Between Military Power Generating Sources and Power Consuming Equipment.
<SOLNBR>W909MY-06-R-C201
<RESPDATE>103105
<ARCHDATE>12302005
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>This announcement is issued to extend the due date for the subject sources sought to 31 October 2005.  The following is a repeat of the original announcement as issued.  On behalf of the Program Manager-Mobile Electric Power, the US Army Research, De velopment and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communication, Command and Control Directorate (C2D), Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA is performing a market survey of commercial and military power distribution equipment. The CERD EC Power Generation Branch is searching for a new family of power distribution equipment capable of transmitting electrical power between military power generating sources (see www.pmmep.org/ for specifications) and power consuming equipment. The desired p ower distribution equipment must distribute power from central power sources (rated at 10kW-200kW, 120/208VAC and/or 240/416VAC, single and three phase systems), be man-portable, provide flexibility to unit operations, and be quickly assembled and disassem bled for rapid relocation. In addition, the power distribution equipment must operate at various altitudes and in climatic conditions of 40 degrees Fahrenheit to +140 degrees Fahrenheit, rain, humidity, salt spray, and fungus.  The power distribution equi pment must be compatible with International Standardization Organization (ISO) containers, Standardized Integrated Command Post (SICPs) System Rigid Wall Shelters, and Tent Extendable, Modular, Personnel (TEMPER).  In particular, the new power distribution  equipment must be capable of the functionality contained within the current Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) of the Army (specifications can be found at https://www.logsa.army.mil/etms/data/A/069909.pdf) at a minimum.  Some addit ional features desired are automatic load balancing between phases, paralleling capability, no-break load transferring between generators and data logging of power characteristics.  Weight and footprint should not exceed that of the current PDISE system. CERDEC is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the experience of each contractor in design, development, and fabrication and testing of their power distribution systems, detailed specifications of their power d istribution systems, organizational capabilities, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for potential future government procurements. The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose require ments.  There is no funding available to procure materials that meet the above requirements at this time.   It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. In addition, the Government does not plan to pay for any information received from this request for information (RFI).  If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an a ddendum.    All responses to this market research shall be submitted no later than close of business on 31 October 2005.  Responses must be submitted via electronic mail to Ms. Michelle N Gaffney, Project Engineer at michelle.gaffney@armypower.army.mil. Al l questions of a technical nature should be directed to Ms. Gaffney at the above email address.  All questions of a contractual nature shall be address to Ms. Patricia Davis, Contracting Officer at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil.  No telephonic inquiries or reque sts will be honored.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service is actively working to develop and implement its requirements for its Phase 3 Mail Processing Infrastructure (MPI) program and is seeking sources to pre-qualify for these requirements.  The requirements include pre-installation, installation, and post installation activities necessary for successful structured wiring implementation upgrading of base-band local area network (LAN) wiring at approximately 160 small, medium and large Mail Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs); approximately 21 administrative LANs co-located at P&DCs receiving workroom floor upgrades; provide standard MPI documentation in facilitating support of the LANs to provide a uniform approach to troubleshooting and maintaining all local network components.  The purpose of this notice seeking sources to pre-qualify is to afford prospective suppliers the opportunity to submit their request to be considered as a pre-qualified supplier for these requirements. Only those suppliers who wish to be a prime contractor need respond to this announcement.  Pre-qualified suppliers are companies whose record of performance in the marketplace (Postal Service, other government, or commercial) has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards of quality and reliability.  The pre-qualified suppliers list will remain in effect for a five-year period and will be used for the current Mail Processing Infrastructure Phase 3 requirements and for any additional follow-on requirements deemed appropriate during the five-year period.  The Postal Service may consider additional suppliers for pre-qualification during this five year period based upon their ability to demonstrate a record of performance with consistently high standards of quality and reliability in the marketplace (Postal Service, other government, or commercial).  Any entity seeking pre-qualification after the initial list of pre-qualified suppliers has been established must provide the same prequalification information below.  Suppliers should demonstrate their capability to meet the following qualifications; working knowledge of Federal, state, local and industry electric codes; experience in installation of LAN networks in large 24 hour production facilities (Postal facility experience preferred); minimum of one currently Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) engineer assigned to the MPI Program effort supporting all system design matters; current membership in and Building Industry Consulting Services International  (BICSI) certification; experienced CAD operators; engineering design capabilities to support system design and installation; Microsoft office products computer skills; ability to manage and meet schedule dates at multiple concurrent site installations at diverse locations throughout the country; configuration control management; demonstrated project management capabilities for programs of similar magnitude (Postal experience preferred) and quality to include warranty support and certification which will form the qualified base for the Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements. The United States Postal Service reserves the right not to award, or to award a single or multiple contracts for Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements; the instant Phase 3 requirements are contemplated in resulting in two or more awards to suppliers pre-qualified to participate in the Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements.  Your qualification statement should address each evaluation factor in the order listed below.  For consideration for pre-qualification, the potential supplier must provide the following information for evaluation: 1) Provide the program name(s) for work completed relating to structured wiring implementation upgrading of base-band local area network wiring for which your company was involved and identify the percentage of that effort for which your company was responsible.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as an Lentivirus Vector Production Core Laboratory (LCL) for a new five-year study, Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP).  The purpose of the program is to facilitate the translation of basic research in gene therapy to clinical application in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases.  The GTRP will provide resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies.  In addition, the GTRP will provide funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials.  The GTRP will consist of  a clinical coordinating center that will oversee and coordinate the logistics of the core laboratories and provide regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory.  The LCL will 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide, maintain and update a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, a customer satisfaction survey for investigators to evaluate the quality and acceptability of the product and timeliness of the service provided, 4) develop, in collaboration with the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), maintain and update a secure and password protected web site page and provide updates to the CCC as needed, 5) produce scalable clinical grade lentiviral vectors, in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and applicable Federal and State regulations, for use by NHLBI-funded investigators, 6) prepare and ship vectors, in accordance with the MOP and Federal and State guidelines, upon completion of GMP production and testing, 7) maintain product-related inventories in a secure and confidential manner, 8)  monitor facilities to ensure quality control of vector production and accuracy and completeness of production data, and maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, and 9) prepare materials for and participate in site visits to the contractor?s facilities and ensure that up-to-date versions of all required certifications, inspections, and assurances are available for review during site visits.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Agile Software Corporation for Agile/Oracle software maintenance and technical support for its proprietary configuration management software for the Radar Operations Center (ROC), Norman, Oklahoma. Background: The NEXRAD weather radar network is a Tri-agency (DOD, DOC, and DOT) funded and managed program. The use of the Agile software has enabled the members of the Configuration Change Board (CCB) to efficiently manage and track all technical information pertaining to the NEXRAD weather radar system configuration. In September of 1993, the Prime Contractor (Unisys) for the NEXRAD weather radar (then referred to as WSR-88D) delivered a database for Baseline Status Accounting. The product delivered was a front end application entitled “CMStat” that ran on an Ingress database engine. CMStat used a command line interface that was extremely difficult to use and poorly designed. Over time, the poorly designed CMStat application began to function extremely slow and failed to meet additional criteria being demanded by the Tri-Agency. In 1997 the ROC solicited bids for software to replace CMStat and Agile Software was awarded the contract. In addition to the procurement of the Agile software, in January of 1998 the Agile Software Corporation was contracted to assist the ROC Configuration Management personnel to map the existing data from the CMStat database to the Agile database. This effort required hundreds of man-hours to complete and test. An additional three months of dedicated staff hours were necessary to attach graphic files to the document object in the database and modify configuration management processes to the current status. The ROC uses Agile software to manage technical drawings, technical manuals, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Configuration Change Requests (CCR), Document Change Request (DCR), Artwork Change Order (ACO), CCB member comments, and electronic approval for modifications to the NEXRAD radar system. All of the above listed documentation is contained within the application and may be viewed by any individual having access to the Agile server. The Agile client software gives the end user the ability to view any documents stored in the application even if the software that generated the document does not reside on the local PC. The Agile software is an integral part of the ROC engineering process tracking and the primary tool used to manage the configuration of the NEXRAD weather radar system. Requirements:  The ROC requires the delivery of all Agile server and client software upgrades and software patches that become available from the Agile Software Corporation. The ROC requires that all delivered Agile software be compatible with the existing Agile/Oracle database schema and must maintain the current software functionality. The ROC requires that all necessary Oracle server and client components and licensing be delivered with any Agile Software releases. The ROC requires unlimited telephone technical support for Agile server and client software and Oracle server and client software (as it relates to Agile software) be made available, at a minimum, during normal business hours Monday through Friday.  
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/. This synopsis is issued for information purposes only. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements, within 15 days of this notice, to the above address. Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice. Anticipated award date will be October 28, 2005.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. This RFI constitutes a request for additional information pursuant to the USCG’s RFI #ACS5D001 posted on FEDBIZOPS on July 15, 2005. This posting should be reviewed for background information. The USCG is soliciting additional and more detailed information on the following requirement from the previously posted RFI:  ”RECEIVE/TRANSMIT: NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VHF Data Link to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm. The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nautical miles of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1. The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined. Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.”  The USCG needs to evaluate more closely industry’s ability to meet the long-range receive (out to 2000 nautical miles) requirement. Items of interest include, but are not limited to, engineering approach (e.g., satellite/UAV/other off-shore platforms, receiver technology), message management and data congestion, and collision. Information regarding both short- and long-term support capabilities is also sought. These items include, but are not limited to, the ability to reach and maintain life-cycle reliability requirements, life-cycle configuration management capabilities, and technical data planning.
The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI. The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information. Companies are requested to submit responses to this RFI no later than Monday, October 31, 2005.  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives; and identify whether or not your company is a large or small business based on the Size Standard of $12,500,000 for NAICS Code 517910.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted via email to Kerri Chambers at kchambers@comdt.uscg.mil and Carmen Correa at ccorrea@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at 1900 Half Street SW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC  20593.

<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) plans to negotiate a single source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures with the Pennsylvania State University(PSU) under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.   The purchase order may be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, through Federal Acquisition Circular(FAC) 2005-6.  The purpose of this acquisition is to procure special precipitation chemistry measurement services from the PSU, Department of Meteorology site in State College, Pennsylvania.  The PSU monitoring site may not be relocated as it is near the center of the region most affected by anthropogenic emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides and has been a major center for the precipitation chemistry measurement program inter-comparisons since the early 1980s.  The PSU site provides precipitation chemistry measurements for the NOAA, the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network(AIRMoN), AIRMoN-dry, and NADP/NTN.  The information gathered is essential to NOAA’s mission as it relates to precipitation chemistry monitoring community. Therefore for the above reasons no other site or organization can provide the services of this requirement.  A thirty(30) month purchase order is planned.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. Reference number: NRMAC000-6-00001.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for exposure matrices services for the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration.  The Government plans to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract established on the basis of firm-fixed rates for labor hour services.  This is a Request for Proposals (RFP) DOL069RQ20142.  I. BACKGROUND   Public Law 106-398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000, as amended (the Act), established a program to compensate nuclear weapons program workers who suffered adverse health effects from exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards in the course of their nuclear weapons program-related work.  The President, in an Executive Order dated December 7, 2000, assigned program implementation responsibilities to various executive departments.  The Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Bush on October 28, 2004, abolished Part D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and replaced it with a new system of federal payments called Part E to be administered by the Department of Labor (DOL).  The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) has responsibilities under Part E of the EEOICPA to issue decisions concerning whether certain employees of DOE contractors or subcontractors contracted occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the work environment.  It is essential that DEEOIC have accurate, timely, and useful information regarding the toxic substances used at DOE sites throughout the United States.  The DEEOIC currently has records from DOE related to:  DOE Former Worker Programs (i.e. needs assessments), site reports (i.e. Tiger Team Reports, Environment Safety and Health reports, site history reports), operational safety procedures, environmental impact reports, job descriptions/labor categories, exposure assessment reports, accident investigation reports, field logs, emergency management plans, lists of chemicals utilized at the sites, industrial hygiene records and epidemiological studies.  
The challenges to developing useful data to identify exposures are considerable.  Many of the records do not exist or are not retrievable; some facilities no longer exist and the documentation has been archived; most sites had thousands of toxic substances present.  Data may be available from DOE Headquarters, DOE field sites, the Former Worker Program, as well as other locations.  Data sources may include industrial hygiene records, occupational medicine records, epidemiology data, personnel records, union records, etc.  The Contractor shall also gather information from current and former employees of DOE at the DOE sites.  This may be accomplished in a roundtable type discussion.
The data currently maintained and the additional data that will be identified and obtained by the Contractor will be used by Claims Examiners to conduct research of DOE facilities and uranium mines and mills as an informational tool to assist with adjudication of claims under the Act.  This information will be used to validate information obtained from DOE or from the claimants.
The successful Contractor will have extensive institutional knowledge of the current and historical operations performed at the DOE facilities; uranium mines and mills, and be able to relate toxic exposures to this information.  The Contractor must have access or the ability to gain access to documents and data that identifies toxic substances used in specific sites or by specific occupations, and to analyze the data and present it in a manner for efficient adjudication of claims.  This may include an established contractual relationship with subcontractors such as the Former Worker Program, research universities, or others.  Some of this information may be classified and may include data covered under the Privacy Act.  The Contractor must have a security clearance with DOE or the ability to obtain a clearance and have secure space to maintain classified documents.
The Contractor shall perform field work to complete the data development for the 12 sites currently identified in the government owned database.  The Contractor shall identify DOE sites and data for completion of additional 15 sites.  The Contractor shall provide a plan for developing data and completing the remaining DOE facilities.
II. SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall perform field work, analyze data, validate and complete the current data provided by DEEOIC for the 12 sites partially developed in the database.

The Contractor shall query current and former workers of DOE to assist in enhancing the data.  The DEEOIC will review and approve the order of site development to include completion of 15 additional sites.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for records that should be utilized for the exposure matrices and develop the data input.  The Contractor shall research and identify occupations at covered DOE sites, building numbers where particular types of work were performed, and the toxic substances present at the sites.  The Contractor shall further identify the timeframes during which particular toxic substances were present and the diseases related to those toxic substances.  The Contractor shall establish Quality Control procedures for validating data.  The Contractor shall develop and submit a plan for completing the exposure matrices for the remaining DOE facilities.

	The Contractor must show how they intend to perform the 	research component of the task and the methodology they 	would use for ensuring accurate and valid data.  This 	includes research options, relationships with other 	entities, etc.  The methodology must consider efficiency in 	obtaining the data.  The Former Worker Program (FWP) has 	performed site assessments and may have valuable 	information that can be used to backfill data for certain 	sites.  The Contractor shall identify relationships with 	the Former Worker Program and intentions for utilizing the 	FWP source data. 
	The Contractor must identify an approach to gathering data 	from current and former workers of DOE sites.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)           The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of  the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.
