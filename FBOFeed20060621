<CONTACT>Irie Clarke, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1421, Irie.Clarke@HQ.DOE.GOV;Matthew Phelps, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1524, Matthew.Phelps@hq.doe.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with Motorola Corporation. The proposed contract will provide radio console equipment, training and warranty/maintenance to the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA). The mission of SSA is to develop strategies and policies governing the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department of Energy, and to strengthen the Departmentâ€™s national security posture through conscientious, just and thoughtful application of Federal rules and statutes governing personnel security to ensure that only individuals whose character, associations and loyalty are granted access to DOE classified information and materials. The work performed under this contract includes the following specific items and tasks: two radio dispatch consoles, systems integration, training and warranty/maintenance. The work on this Motorola contract shall be performed at the DOE facilities, located within the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area. The vendor will have and maintain a current production line to manufacture all Radio and associated equipment quoted in the bid and guarantee that component part suppliers can meet this requirement.  Also, the vendor must have and maintain the capability to manufacture the current equipment listed in their bid or a similar product with enhanced capabilities.  Statements of capability must include items identified in this synopsis.  Authorized re-sellers are not eligible for this requirement. The current radio infrastructure is comprised entirely of Motorola equipment. All radios and associated equipment use the Motorola format.  This acquisition is an upgrade to existing Motorola equipment, it must be 100% compatible with the current equipment.  To attempt to adapt another equipment manufacturerâ€™s console into this system would cause countless problems, circuitry adaptations and compromises, and loss of time and service.  As mentioned, this acquisition will be with the Motorola Corporation and not with an authorized reseller because of the increased price markup routinely associated with the third party company.  The radio consoles must be programmed and staged at a Motorola facility and programmed uniquely for the Department of Energy.  Because of this unique programming requirement, a third party vendor or reseller could not obtain a quantity discount. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. Motorola has the requisite equipment to supply the DOE with the essential equipment, training and warranty/maintenance.  Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâ€™s ability to provide the items described above.  Statements of capability must include all line items identified in this synopsis.  Authorized re-sellers and distributors are not eligible for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within fifteen (15) days of this notice via the Department of Energy "Industry Interactive Procurement Systems" (IIPS) at the following Internet address http://doe-iips.pr.doe.gov/. Vendors must register via the IIPS web site prior to responding to this market survey.  Instructions on how to submit your response can be found in the document, which is located at http://doe-iips.pr.doe.gov/. For technical assistance firms should call 1-800 683-0751 or email the IIPS administrator at iips@pr.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 423690.  ***See Numbered Note 22.

MacDill AFB requires the services of an independent contractor to remove the treated biosolids from the WWTP.  The contractor shall follow all applicable environmental regulations.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to the University of Washington.  

The main objective of this contract is to develop unique surface chemistries for Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) instrument micro-chips that will capture and present specific foodborne pathogens and toxins for SPR detection, and to perform multi-laboratory validation studies to demonstrate the reproducibility, accuracy and robustness of pathogen and toxin detection protocols in food.

This contract will result in a five year IDIQ type contract with task orders.  The objectives of the task orders include but are not limited to: (1) Develop and finalize SPR micro-chip surface chemistries for antibody-based capture and detection of small target analytes using the marine biotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as the model analyte. (2)Demonstrate the enhanced performance of improved SPR surface chemistries for antibody-based capture and detection of the marine biotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) using a model detection protocol that demonstrates before-and-after improvements in detection performance. (3) Develop and finalize SPR micro-chip surface chemistries for antibody-based and/or DNA homology based capture and detection of the foodborne bacteria, viruses or toxins.  The example analytes to be used should specifically include, a toxin, a virus (bird flu virus / norovirus / calici virus / rotavirus or comparable virus that causes foodborne illness), and/or a bacterium (E. coli OH157:H7 / Clostridium spp. / Shigella spp. / or similar bacterium that causes acute bacterial diarrhea or food poisoning). (4) Participate in a Multi-laboratory comparison of SPR methodology for the purpose of validating the reproducibility, accuracy and robustness of pathogen and toxin detection protocols in food.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract modification to Textron Systems Corporation, 201 Lowell Street, Wilmington MA 01887, for the systems engineering for the systems and subsystems related to the Electro-Optical Systems.  The Contractor will provide the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) with software and hardware upgrades to the basic optical capabilities while continuing to study the best ways to expand and improve these capabilities in the future.  These upgrades will be state of the art technologies including, but not limited to, telescopes, cameras, data recording systems, mounts and pre-product improvements items. Textron Corporation originally developed the Stabilized High-Accuracy Optical Tracking System (SHOTS) for the Navy, as well as the Observatory Control System (OCS) for the Air Force and adapted the core of the OCS for use as the SHOTS MCS.  The Textron developed mount control system is the only known system with the level of stabilization required to operate this large aperture telescope on board a ship.  Synchronization of mission planning, operations, and intelligence functions at all levels relative to the operation of SHOTS MCS is crucial to meeting the mission schedule and minimizing any impact to either fleet readiness or national defense.  No other contractor has the experience and capability to provide the accuracy required to track ballistic missiles from a ship at sea. The period of performance will be from date of contract award for twelve months thereafter, with four options for an additional twelve months each.  This contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Textron Systems Corporation directly.  See Numbered Note 22*****

No other company has, collectively, developed the level of expertise or access to key individuals in the DoD community to perform the defined task. Any other company would require significantly more time (estimated at well over 50 percent) to perform this tasking due to the need to establish the contacts within the DoD and Navy that Bishop Group Inc already has established.  Therefore, no other company is in the position to provide the required support.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA is issuing a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N68936-06-T-0128 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake CA intends to procure on a full and open competition basis one (1) large target in the shape of a trapezoidal wall.  The Navy is testing a new fire fighting and countermeasures washdown concept for ships.  Testing is to occur as soon as possible, and begin no later than September 21st, 2006, at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division at China Lake.  The Navy will acquire a fire test article that consists of a large target in the sh!  ape of a trapezoidal wall.  The wall will be mounted on a rail at NAWCWD's Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track (SNORT).  The Navy requires the wall to be lightweight and rigid.  It should be a space-frame structure clad with a ribbed sheet-metal sheath.  It is anticipated that the structural elements will be fabricated off-site, with final assembly/erection occurring onsite. The wall will be canted 20 degrees from vertical and supported from behind by structural pipe.  The wall will be mounted on the eastern track at SNORT and a suitable mass will be available to mount the pipe supports to prevent wind tipping the wall over.  The structure will be designed to stand in a 60 knot wind.  In addition to the mass for attachment to the structural support pipes behind the wall, the wall will also be secured with guy wires (1/2" steel rope and turnbuckles). To support testing, a 3/8" plywood sheath will be attached to the wall by the Navy prior to being erected.  The wall will be painted by the Navy, and an environmental coating (clear polyethylene sheet) will be used by the Navy to cover the wall.  Ten one-square-foot holes will be cut in the wall by the Navy as water collection ports.  The location of these ports will be determined by the Navy. The wall will stand sixty feet tall from base to top when canted over at 20 degrees.  The length of the base of the wall must be 70 feet.  The length of the top of the wall must be 23 feet and 4 inches.  The angle between the bottom of the wall and its sides will be 69 degrees.  The trapezoidal sides of the wall should then be 64 feet long.   The wall will have water sprayed at it, which will be collected via the water ports and measured.  Testing will occur under 5 to 20 knot wind.  Additional testing will require the Navy to cut a hole in the wall approximately 10 feet from the bottom of the wall. The hole will be ellipsoidal in shape, 5 feet long and 2 feet high. Wall may require a crane for erection.  NAWCWD China Lake requires all crane work to be done with a certified crane.  Several companies provide certified cranes for on-center work.  Offerors may wish to contact one of them for its crane needs. Examples of companies with NAWCWD China Lake certified cranes are T & T Crane (661-393-0795), Bragg (800-892-7263), and Turner Crane (661-399-9377). Awardee shall require access to NAWCWD China Lake's north range.  This requires workers with U.S. citizenship. Awardee will provide analysis of expected loads under nominal wind conditions (60 knots) four weeks prior to arrival at NAWCWD China Lake to begin wall construction.  Engineering drawings and "as-builts" are due at project completion. The provision FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jan 2005) applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to the provision.  FAR Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies and contains important evaluation information.  Award shall be based on the following evaluation criteria: technical description and preliminary drawings of the item being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation; timeline for completion wherein reduced delivery time is desired, however the Government will not pay a premium for expedience; past performance, and price.

<SUBJECT>F--Long Term Wild Horse Holding Facility Located West of the Mississippi
<SOLNBR>NAR060209
<RESPDATE>080206
<ARCHDATE>06212007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for two pasture facilities to maintain up to 1,500 wild horses each, from around October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located west of the Mississippi River. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: a. Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program. Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land. b. 	The purpose of this contract is to obtain a facility (located west of the Mississippi River), to pasture a maximum of 1,500 (plus or minus) head of horses. The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land. During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses will be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis. It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. c. On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This will require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract. All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering. All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. d. The Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of two contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 1,500 wild horses, or one contract with the capacity of 3,000 wild horses) resulting from this Request for Proposals (RFP) for a long term wild horse holding facility located west of the Mississippi. The contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facility must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award. Once the facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility. This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award. No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period. Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. e.	Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. Objective - The objectives of this contract are: a. To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; b. To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals. c. To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; d. To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; e. Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services - The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks. Specific requirements for each are set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of the Description/Specifications/Work Statement. a. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a maximum of 1,500 or 3,000 wild horses (mares and geldings) grazing in pastures. The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant). b. Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis. c. Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. d. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. e. 	Gather and hold horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment. f. Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw blood samples for horses prior to shipment. g. Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations. h. 	Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc. The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI. i. Dispose of the remains of dead horses. The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. Specific Services - a. Handling and Gathering. (1)  In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load. The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments. BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival. However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time. The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups. (2) All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling. (3) Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses. The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices. (4) Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI. The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI. A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather. The gather will be conducted in a humane manner. Horses will be maintained separate in a corral area for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment. Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facility to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment. (5) The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals. The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR060209, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about July 3, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Human Space Flight Mission Services that includes training and operational support at two unique facilities:  the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) and the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF).	The support required includes the support of suited astronauts and other subjects in a neutrally buoyant environment; maintenance and upgrade of complex mechanical, hydraulic, fluid, and electrical systems; design and manufacture of space vehicle mockups; and operation of two complex facilities.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Raytheon Technical Services Company through an extension of the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)/Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF) Operations Contract (NSOC), NAS9-02102.  The proposed period of performance for the NSOC extension is April 1, 2008, through September 30, 2010, plus a 1-year option for services through September 30, 2011.	 Training activities at the NBL are critical to the continued and uninterrupted support required during the remaining Space Shuttle Flights and International Space Station (ISS) assembly sequence.  Unique requirements for certified and highly trained safety, utility, and reconfiguration divers exist.  The certification process for a new diver requires at least a 6-month time commitment, and any turnover in the staffing level would be unacceptable due to the potential interruption to the flight schedule.	Additionally, complex systems including life support systems, breathing gas systems, Robotic Manipulator Systems, and Water Treatment Systems are operated, maintained, and upgraded by highly qualified and skilled technicians and engineers with extensive experience in the individual systems.  Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  The turmoil and uncertainty involved in a contract transition would result in the workforce being distracted from the job at hand because of the uncertainties inherent during a competition (e.g. concern about employment, benefits, and new management) and disruptions caused by new company policies.  Any disruption to these activities could also result in a delay to the flight and assembly sequence which would be unacceptable.	All activities at the NBL are safety and life critical, and the safety risk to the Government associated with transitioning a new contractor can not be accepted at this time due to the criticality of timing and support requirements.  Support at the SVMF requires the operation, maintenance, and upgrade of approximately 30+ medium and high fidelity space vehicle mockups.  The mockups must be readied for instructor and crew activities on a very tight schedule, and to exacting standards.  Any deviation to configuration can result in negative crew training, and the inability of a mission to be performed in a timely and safe manner.  The loss of configuration knowledge and skills due to a contract transition could result in an unacceptable delay to the flight and assembly sequence. NASA plans to use the Space Shuttle to complete the assembly of the ISS and maintain the commitments made to the international partners.  The ISS assembly schedule is tightly constrained with the Space Shuttle retirement in 2010, or earlier.  The schedule margin that would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a new space operations contractor into the program would not support the ISS assembly schedule.  Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to both the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  However, it is the Government’s intention to compete this effort following this critical extension period of performance and once our requirements are better understood. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 20, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The loss of configuration knowledge and skills due to a contract transition could result in an unacceptable delay to the flight and assembly sequence. NASA plans to use the Space Shuttle to complete the assembly of the ISS. The ISS assembly schedule is tightly constrained with the Space Shuttle retirement in 2010, or earlier. The schedule margin that would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a new space operations contractor into the program would not support the ISS assembly schedule. Competition of the Space Shuttle and ISS space operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel introducing risk to both the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

Technical Assistance for the Alternate Mining Technology for Mine-III Expansion Project in Tamil Nadu, India.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to assess alternative mining technology options for its Mine-III Expansion Project in Tamil Nadu, India.

The Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. (NLC or “Grantee”) controls 3.38 billion tons of lignite resources in the Cuddalore District of Tamil Nadu, India.  NLC currently produces 24 million tons per annum (mtpa) of lignite from area surface mines in its Mine-I and Mine-II Reserve Areas.  NLC plans to develop Mine-III in the southern portion of its Lease Area.  Mine-III is proposed to produce and deliver 8.0 mtpa of lignite to NLC’s proposed 2x500 MW Thermal Power Station III (TPS-III) project.

NLC has undertaken exploration work and several studies of the Mine-III Area to delineate mineable lignite and define mining plans.  The most current plans are based on the NLC’s bucket-wheel and conveyor mining systems in place at its existing mines.  For Mine-III, the Grantee has also conceptually studied potential alternative mining technology widely used for surface coal mining in the United States and worldwide.

NLC requires definitive Technical Assistance concerning Mine-III.  The Technical Assistance will be based on alternative mining technology including: large walking draglines, large shovels and truck fleets, large shovels and in-pit conveyors, and other proven mining systems that will be effective for overburden removal and lignite mining in Mine-III.  The Technical Assistance is to be for a production rate of 8.0 mtpa for the life of the Mine-III lignite reserve.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $360,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Annual options for 5, 6, and 10 Group A and B kit installations will be established for FY08 thru FY10.  Group B will be furnished by the Government.  The Government will not possess data or reprocurement drawings for Group A; therefore it is contemplated that the prospective Group A manufacturer will be required to obtain necessary manufacturing data from Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, who is currently on contract (F09603-01-D-0207-0115) to develop the initial Group A kit and install Group A and B in the first aircraft.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to issue a single award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for one base year and four option years for the SubSkillsNet-VISIT Program on or before the 15th of August 2006.  The minimum contract award amount is $100,000. The maximum not-to-exceed amount is $12,000,000 for the 60 month period of performance. A full and open competition will be conducted among all qualified and interested bidders. The applicable FSC Code is 6910, SIC 7371 and NAICS 541511 with $23 million limitation.

All personnel working on this project must have Security Clearances at the Secret Level.

The place of performance is NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, SubSkillsNet Laboratory, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.

A Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled for 8th of June 2006 at the above referenced facility. All interested bidders are highly encourage to attend. Additional information will be posted in the solicitation on or about the 2nd of June 2006.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

•	Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
•	The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
•	Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
•	Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
•	Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
•	Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
•	Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
•	Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>This notice is to inform offerors that Fred Chatterton has succeeded Frank Titus as the Contracting Officer for this acquisition.
-------------------------------------------------------------
This synopsis is issued for a proposed acquisition to be solicited under Full and Open Competition procedures.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in Washington, DC will be issuing a Solicitation for Applications that will establish firm-fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination for dental and/or vision benefits to be provided based on the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004.  The Government may award multiple contracts for dental benefits and for vision benefits.  We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a consortium.

We invite interested offerors to review our draft statement of work (SOW) and provide comments.  We will post the draft SOW on the OPM Website on or about August 25, 2005 at: http://www.opm.gov/carrier/dentalvision/dvbidders,asp.  We invite comments from interested parties on topics you think we should consider to ensure a healthy competition among offerors and provide prospective offerors with the necessary information to effectively develop a response to the Solicitation.  We must receive comments by 3 p.m. September 6, 2005.  We will consider the comments and questions when finalizing the Solicitation however we will not disclose any questions or comments that are submitted.

We are also requesting comments on our proposed timeline for implementing the dental and vision program.  While the timeline will be included in the draft SOW, potential vendors are encouraged to comment on it immediately at the following email address: DENTAL-VISIONBIDS@OPM.GOV. Our current timeline for procurement actions leads up to a July 2006 start date.  We are soliciting input on the preferences of interested vendors for a later date in 2006 that would be more compatible with other Federal employee benefit programs that operate on a calendar year cycle.  Concerns about a mid-year start date include potential increased underwriting risk and/or low enrollment for the initial six month enrollment period.  While we are prepared to address these concerns, if industry reaction indicates that a mid-year startup is not optimal, OPM will consider a start up date based on the beginning of the last pay period in 2006 and revise the proposed timeline and SOW accordingly.  If this course of action is followed, both will be reissued for comment at a later date.

TENTATIVE TIMELINE:

2005;	August 25 - SOW posted on OPM’s web site for public comment;	September 6 - Vendor comments due to OPM;	September 16 - Solicitation for Applications issued;	September 30 - Interested Parties Conference;	November 16 - Vendor bids due
2006;	January 16 - OPM bid review, negotiation and final proposal revision;	February 28 - Contract awards and contract negotiations;	April/May - Open Season enrollment;	July 1 - Effective date.
 
Under this timeline, the Solicitation will be issued on or about September 16, 2005 with proposals due on or about November 16, 2005.  An opportunity for questions will also be offered. Our award decision will be based on a best-value determination: All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal in importance to cost or price.

At a minimum, proposals must include the following: 1) A detailed statement of the benefits offered (including any maximums, limitations, exclusions, and other definitions of benefits); 2) The premiums proposed and underlying assumptions; 3) Demonstration of proven experience in providing dental and/or vision benefits to public and private sector organizations, and 4) Demonstration of the financial resources necessary to bear the insurance risk.  Proposals will be evaluated using weighted factors, as described in the Solicitation

The base period for contracts awarded will be seven years, with option periods each consisting of seven years.  There will be no limit to the number of options the Government may exercise.  Assuming a July, 2006 start date, the base period would begin on or about March 1, 2006, with program benefits to be available to enrollees on July 1, 2006.  The Solicitation for Applications will be available exclusively for download electronically approximately 30 calendar days after the date of this posting through the Federal Government’s Federal Business Opportunities [FedBizOps] Website: http://www.fbo.gov.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 524114 (Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers), with the small business size standard associated with this NAICS code of less than $6 million in average annual sales for the preceding three years.  OPM will consider all responsive sources that submit a proposal.

<DESC>This requirement has been changed from a spot buy to a Standing Price Quote, not to exceed one year. Please see revised attached Word document.  All quotes already received will be considered for award unless advised differently.  Please resubmit quotes if changes need to be made.  New quotes will be accepted until 06/26/2006.  


Please see attached Word Doc for complete description.  GSA, FSS intends to establish a Request for Quote for one (1) National Stock Number in the 5120 Federal Supply Class.  This is a spot buy.  This NSN is part of GSA’s Stock Program.  All offers for this RFQ are to be FOB destination.  In addition to the normal clauses that apply to GSA stock tool orders, the following clauses apply; 552.225-70 Notice of Procurement Restriction – Hand or Measuring Tools or Stainless Steel Flatware, D-FSS-475 Bar Coding and 552.246-70 Source Inspection applies, D-FSS-468 Non-Manufactured Wood Package Material to European Union (Nov 2001). The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance, Delivery, and Price.  Past Performance will be based on information obtained by GSA’s Administrative Contracting Office in Chicago, IL.  Any offeror within the competitive range and has not previously performed work with GSA, (therefore does not have a performance history with GSA,) will be given the opportunity to provide references that will verify their ability to perform.  Past Performance and Delivery when combined are significantly more important than price.  Where proposals are determined to be essentially equal, the award will be made to the contractor submitting the lowest price. For questions please contact Katie Solon, Contract Specialist at 816-823-1929 or Katherine.Solon@gsa.gov.  Please fax your quotes to Katie Solon at 816-926-3678 by June 16, 2006

BACKGROUND

	Created in 1993, the Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) is a government corporation that oversees three national service initiatives—AmeriCorps, which includes AmeriCorps* VISTA (VISTA), AmeriCorps* National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) and hundreds of local and national non-profits; Learn and Serve America (Learn and Serve), which provides models and assistance to help teachers integrate service and learning from kindergarten through college; the National Senior Service Corps (NSSC), which includes the Foster Grandparent Program (FGP), the Senior Companions Program (SCP), and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP).

	The Corporation’s mission is to provide opportunities for Americans of all ages and backgrounds to engage in service that addresses the nation’s educational, public safety, environmental, and other human needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results and to encourage all Americans to engage in such service.  The Corporation strives to foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service.

	The Corporation employs about 580 people with headquarters located in Washington, D.C.  There are 48 Corporation State Offices serving all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.  Five Service Centers located in Atlanta, GA, Philadelphia, PA, Chicago, IL, Oakland, CA, and Dallas, TX support the Corporation State Offices.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE
 
The Corporation has implemented a wide range of ADP and communications systems in order to support its mission of national volunteerism.  The Corporation has implemented Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies and services in order to satisfy the requirement for high speed and reliable data communications throughout the Corporation's facilities.  The Office of Information Technology (OIT) is responsible for providing access, support, enhancements and the future development of these systems for the entire Corporation.

The Corporation maintains both Wide Area Network and Local Area Network (WAN/LAN) connections for its employees, contractors, and the computer labs of the NCCC.  There are approximately 800 individual computers on this network.  The Corporation's WAN is comprised of a series of Frame Relay clouds used to connect LANs at the Corporation's five regional Service Centers, the five NCCC Campuses, and forty-eight Corporation State Offices, with the Corporation’s headquarters.  All of the Corporation's network servers are located in the computer room of the Washington D.C. headquarters building.  These servers provide all necessary network services for headquarters users, as well as providing more advanced services (such as electronic mail and a suite of Oracle servers) to the entirety of the Corporation's WAN. 

	The Corporation headquarters’ network backbone is collapsed into a high speed, switched, gigabit Ethernet network.  The Corporation servers are connected to a Cisco Catalyst 6509 high-speed switch.  This switch connects several Cisco routers, a gigabit Ethernet link to local offices (other than the 6th floor headquarters), a Cisco AS5350 Access Server and access to the Internet.  One router connects to Frame Relay networks supporting all state offices, the NCCC, and the Service Centers.  A second router connects to a second Frame Relay network, which provides redundancy for several critical remote offices.  Separate routers connect a T1 Point-to-Point (PTP) circuit to our disaster recovery site and a T1 PTP circuit to a Department of Interior site, which houses the Corporation’s financial management system.  A Cisco 2610 router is also located at the disaster recovery site and at remote state offices.  A second Cisco Catalyst 6509 switch serves the clients on the 6th floor headquarters, and serves as a fallback switch for the primary Cisco Catalyst 6509 switch.  The Cisco AS5350 Access Server provides a dial-in capability for remote users and by the end of the fiscal year 2005 a VPN solution will be in place for high speed remote users. 
 
OIT maintains 60 + Application/File servers using Windows 2000, of which there is a 19 server Oracle farm operating on both 9i & 10g versions of the database.  Microsoft Office XP is the standard office automation software, Microsoft Exchange is used for e-mail, and Microsoft Internet Explorer is used as the Internet/Intranet browser.  The Corporation Network services approximately 750 core staff members nationwide; approximately 400 are located in the Headquarters facility.
 
MAJOR SYSTEMS AND GENERAL SUPPORT SYSTEM
 
•	“Momentum” is the Corporation’s financial management system.  It is an Oracle-based proprietary system developed by the CGI-American Management Systems.  The system utilizes Oracle 8.1.7.  The software runs on Windows 2000 servers at the Interior Department’s National Business Center hosting facility in Ashburn, VA. 
 
•	eSPAN (the electronic System for Programs, Agreements, and National Service Participants) is an Oracle-based system originally designed to serve as the central core repository of Corporation program data.  It has subsystems to manage member activities of the National Service Trust, all grants management functions, the “payroll” process of the AmeriCorps*VISTA program, AmeriCorps Projects member management and the Corporation’s AmeriCorps recruitment efforts.  eSPAN is used to manage the National Service Trust and to provide AmeriCorps member information to the Corporation. 
 
•	The Corporation has a web site with information about our programs and opportunities.  That site, which has over 1,500 pages, can be reached at www.cns.gov.  The site is hosted at a commercial firm but is maintained by Corporation staff.  The site now averages over 1,100,000 visitors and 5,350,000 hits per month, over 200 percent more than a year ago.  
 
•	The Corporation has a web based recruiting system (AC*RPS) for the AmeriCorps program.  The system permits the several thousand AmeriCorps sites to describe their AmeriCorps opportunities.  Prospective members can search that data using their interests and availability to find matching programs.  From that site members can apply on-line.  Programs can also search for prospective members using data supplied by individuals searching for a program.  To accompany this system, the Senior Corps Recruitment System (JASON), provides Senior Corps projects with a mechanism to publicize volunteer opportunities. 
 
•	The Corporation Network is a Windows 2000 and Cisco based network which serves as the GSS for multiple systems.  The network is described above in the Information Technology Infrastructure section. 

•	The Corporation also uses some other computer applications geared to specific office needs that should be assessed:  iBudget, Salary Management system, Learn and Serve Information Exchange System, I-Desk, VISTA MIS, Administrative Services Property Management System, OIT PR System, OIT Applix System, and the current WBRS system if its integration has not been completed.

•	The Corporation also makes use of major systems of other agencies.  Staff personnel and payroll services are provided by the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center.  The Department of Health and Human Service’s Payment Management System provides grants payment services.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT OF CONTACT (S):       Contracting: J.D. Martin , NSWC Crane, e-mail James.D.Martin@navy.mil , 812-854-3723.       Technical: Dale Platteter, C-605 email platteter@atd.crane.navy.mil , 812-854-1206. The Strategic Systems Division (Code 605) of the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Crane, Indiana, is interested in receiving proposals to investigate the effects of nuclear radiation on advanced semiconductor devices, model the response of electronics systems to radiation, and develop methods to mitigate and test for these effects.  The environments of interest include the natural radiation environment of space (trapped particles, cosmic ray ions, protons, etc.) and man-made sources from weapons effects (gamma rays, neutrons, pulses of energy, etc.).  The effects include total dose, displacement damage, single event effects, dose-rate upset, latchup, and gate rupture.   The semiconductor devices of interest include, but are not limited to, advanced technology digital and analog mixed signal devices, ASICs, FPGAs, gate arrays, microprocessors, memories, digital and analog converters, imagers, sensors, opamps, and discrete devices such power transistors.  Mitigation techniques include hardening by semiconductor processing, device layout, device design, or shielding techniques especially using novel and innovative ideas not previously investigated. Methods to model the man-made and space radiation environments will also be considered. NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in the afore mentioned areas for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding in these specific areas.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until 6/16/07. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the to!  pic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Award of an effort under this BAA does not imply other than full and open competition in the future for follow-on acquisition(s) for the awarded task(s). Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. Additionally, theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation and/or proposed studies are specifically excluded. All criteria as outlined in FAR 35.016 are applicable. In order to minimize the cost related to proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Interested parties may submit more than one white paper.  White Papers should clearly identify which concept area(s) they are responding to. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the prop!  osed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more imp!  ortant than price, but evaluated prices/costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to platteter@atd.crane.navy.mil and James.D.Martin@navy.mil for consideration. Please refer to BAA number N00164-06-R-6533 in all correspondence and communications.

Martin, NSWC Crane, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-3723.       Technical: Renee Jung, C-604 email LogR&D@navy.mil , 812-854-6099. The NSWC Crane conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed to the support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Defense Standardization Program Office’s Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) Knowledge Sharing Portal (DKSP). NSWC Crane is conducting research and development (R&D) for concepts and demonstrations that enhance the capabilities of the DKSP portal and all DKSP user functions.  These concepts include, but are not limited to: 1) DMSMS organizational interaction 2) DMSMS Logistic tools 3) DMSMS Program Management tools 4) Bill Of Material analysis & availability / predictive assessments 5) DMSMS planning and management 6) DMSMS Knowledge interchange 7) DMSMS education 8) DMSMS application tools  9) DMSMS training and education 10) DKSP – related activities 11) DKSP integration with Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) and the DoD DMSMS Working Group Information on the DKSP portal is available at www.dmsms.org.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in the aforementioned areas for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding in these specific areas. Proposals may be based on fundamental research and development; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based DMSMS; integrated data environments and product data managers; secure communication environments; and development of operational systems. This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until 6/15/07. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the to!  pic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Award of an effort under this BAA does not imply other than full and open competition in the future for follow-on acquisition(s) for the awarded task(s). Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. Additionally, theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation and/or proposed studies are specifically excluded. All criteria as outlined in FAR 35.016 are applicable. In order to minimize the cost related to proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Interested parties may submit more than one white paper.  White Papers should clearly identify which concept area(s) they are responding to. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the prop!  osed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more imp!  ortant than price, but evaluated prices/costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil . Please refer to BAA number N00164-06-R-6678 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items as supplemented with the additional information included in this announcement. U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, and the National Weather Service (NWS) intends to solicit for purchase of 100 packages (100 ea per package), Punch, Fischer & Porter (F&P)/Belfort Model No. 402B014T60. The F&P Model 402B rain gage uses a paper punch mechanism that is specifically designed to record precipitation events using mechanical dies perforated onto paper tape. The use of any other manufacturer’s paper punch mechanism other than the Belfort Model 402B14T60 will not function correctly in conjunction with the Belfort Model 401B rain gage. The use of  another manufacturer’s paper punch mechanism would require a redesign of the existing Belfort Model 402B rain gage and would require extensive field testing a a significant cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. This item is used to support the NWS spare parts program. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to solicit for purchase of 60 each, Monitor, Radio Frequency (RF) Power, 10 Watt Maximum, 100 Ohms Minimum, Narda P/N 70069 or 466B-1. The Narda brand RF Power monitors are installed in 168 WSR-88D radar sites.  The NWS had an additional source for an equivalent meter, General Microwave P/N N425-838, but is no longer available. The government now has only a single source for RF Power Monitors and spare parts for the RF Power Monitor. The procurement of bolometer elements for the Narda brand RF Power Monitors is required for the spare parts program at the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, Missouri.  Although the procurement of this specific bolometer element can be competed among suppliers, no part other than Narda part number may be installed in the Narda meter. The unique package size, electrical connection, and material properties of the Narda bolometer assembly make it the only acceptable part for use in a Narda brand RF Power Meter. This particular bolometer element is application specific and is/was designed by Narda for exclusive use in their RF Power Meters. Because the design is the property of Narda, neither the Government nor any other outside entity has access to the specific design features. The bolometer element works in conjunction with the power meter circuitry to accurately measure RF power output of the radar. Each component is mutually reliant upon the other to provide an expected result. Narda will not warranty operation or guarantee performance within specification if specified parts are not used. The NWS conducted a market research to identify a second source of RF Power Monitors, or another source of bolometer elements that would function properly in the Narda monitor. Also, research was conducted on the electronic market to locate any General Microwave RF Power Monitors, but none were found.  The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. Delivery will be on a FOB Destination Basis. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is L3 Communications – Narda Microwave East, 435 Moreland Road, Hauppauge, NY 11788.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified product. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors must provide a written acknowledgement that they will comply with the packaging requirements. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334220.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<DESC>Reference No:  P-3 A-76 RFI Det 4, Moron AB, Spain

17.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) Only.  Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Nov 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for the Det 4, Moron AB, Moron, Spain, Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance System (GEODSS).  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions may/will be conducted if a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  Detachment 4, of the 21st Operations Group, provides optical surveillance for the space surveillance network and is located within government facilities at Moron Air Base, Spain. The scope of operations follows:

To detect, track, identify all man-made objects in space; provide satellite tracking and Space Object Identification (SOI) data to support catalog maintenance of deep-space satellites and priority United States (U.S) space programs; search for space objects beginning at the top of the earth’s atmosphere extending beyond the geosynchronous orbit using government–furnished mission systems in accordance with USSTRATCOM Directive 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The objects may include rocket bodies, payloads, debris, and unknown items.  Specialized knowledge is necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of orbital mechanics and the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).

The system maintenance consists of organizational/user-level maintenance to include:  (a) fault isolation and troubleshooting through the use of built-in test equipment and diagnostic procedures;  (b) restoration of prime mission equipment, generally limited to removal and replacement of faulty components, such as assemblies or subassemblies; (c) inspection, servicing, alignment, and lubrication; (d) preventative (scheduled) maintenance and testing; (e) corrosion control, and (f) accomplishment of organizational level Time Compliance Technical Orders.

The Moron Optical Space Surveillance System (MOSS) consists of a windowed 56cm (22 inch) f/2.3 modified Ritchy-Chretien telescope mounted on a light-weight azimuth/elevation NIKE-AJAX mount.  The telescope is equipped with an up-to-date frame transfer Charge Coupled Device camera.  The operational structure consists of four (4) operator consoles, five (5) control computers, a data processor, image processor, camera processor, and a communications processor using a Red Hat Enterprise LINUX AS v3 based operating system.

All services are required 24 hours per day/seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with at least a secret security clearance.                      




This RFI is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 517910 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $12.5 million. The 517910 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and Satellite tracking requirement.  If as a result of the P3 Competitive Sourcing Decision Package a “GO” decision is identified, the decision will be synopsized and posted to Fed Biz Ops.  In an effort to provide prospective offerors current and relevant information to assist them in making informed business decisions and manage their resources in the most effective way possible, the following is provided:   Det 4, Moron AB, Spain, is currently an Un-priced Contract Line Item (CLIN) on the existing Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance System (GEODSS) contract F05604-03-C-0007, awarded 01 Oct 03 with a base year and four Option Years.  The GEODSS contract is currently in the third option year.  The GEODSS contract optical sites are located at Socorro NM, Diego Garcia BIOT, and Maui HI.  The 21st Contracting Squadron and Program Management Offices have initiated the re-acquisition process to insure a new GEODSS contract is ready for performance commencement on 1 Oct 2008.  Performance on the existing GEODSS contract will conclude on 30 Sep 08.  If the P-3 process results in a “GO” decision and the A-76 study results in contract award, the Det 4, Moron, Spain, Operations, Maintenance and Logistical Support (OM&S) would have a performance period of two years or less to align the work as a GEODSS Contract Line Item on the GEODSS re-acquisition solicitation.  Please note:  this RFI is not for the re-acquisition of the current GEODSS contract.  This RFI is posted to identify offerors who may be interested in providing OM&S at Det 4, Moron, Spain for two years or less.

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 10 July 2006.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUB Zone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<SUBJECT>B -- Legal Review and Assessment
<DESC>The period for questions for the combined synopsis/solicitation, 2006-Q-08549.A has been closed.  The proposals are due June 26, 2006 not later than 9:00 a.m. EST.  Below are responses to questions pertaining to this solicitation.

1. Will the contractor be expected to provide drafts of the report, the template table, or the comprehensive table for review or approval prior to delivery?

Yes.


2. Is the contractor expected to provide publication-quality graphic design and layout of the report and table? 

No.  Although the report should be suitable for publication, it is not necessary to provide publication-quality graphic design and layout.

3. What is the expected length of the final comprehensive report?
It is difficult to assign a specific number of pages -- or even a range -- for the report, because the report length will be determined entirely by the findings of the review.  

The report will be expected to describe the current legal environment for PCRS by synthesizing and interpreting the results of the comprehensive table, providing examples of common and exceptional legal requirements, analyzing how the requirements might affect implementation and operation of PCRS programs, assessing legal obstacles to PCRS, and identifying possible ways in which these obstacles might be addressed.  The report will need to be of sufficient length to accomplish these objectives.

4. Who is the intended audience for the table and/or final report?

CDC leadership and management staff.  CDC staff who are developing new guidelines for HIV partner counseling and referral services.  PCRS program managers in state and local health departments.

5. In the analysis of how provisions in the law may affect the implementation of PCRS for the final report, is the contractor expected to provide only qualitative legal analyses or is any type of quantitative analysis to link the legal information and the implementation of PCRS by health departments also desired?

The primary expectation is that this section would provide a qualitative description of how laws, regulations, and administrative policies might affect implementation of PCRS; however, it would also be desirable to quantify the number of areas in which various effects might be experienced, so as to give a sense of how great the impact might be.

6. In the Instructions to Bidders, page limits are specified for the Technical Approach and the Similar Experience sections but not for the Staffing and Management section. Is there a page limit for the Staffing and Management section and, if so, what is the limit?

There is no specific page limit for the Staffing and Management section.

7. In the Budget instructions, the solicitation indicates to prepare the budget using the "attached template;" however a template was not attached to the solicitation, would CDC please make the template available to bidders? 

The format template is located at the end of the questions.


8. In the Description for the Combined Solicitation, it indicates that "The services will be performed at the Corporate Square Campus....;" however, in the Statement of Work, Section D "Period of Performance/Delivery Schedule," it indicates that the contractor is to participate in an initial conference call and regular conference calls to review the work plan and progress. 

Would the Government please clarify whether they are looking for a contractor to place staff on site at Corporate Square and, if so, for what percentage of time/level of effort or whether the staff could be physically located elsewhere (in the Atlanta area or otherwise) and communicate with CDC via conference call, electronic mail, and other means.

There is no need for the contractor to place staff on site at CDC.  The work can be done elsewhere, as long as there is regular communication with CDC project staff via conference call, electronic mail, or other means.

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). Best value technically acceptable. Must review and comply with the attached IT Security Clauses If this is an electronic and Information Technology (IT) item, it must meet all or part of the applicable accessibility standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board at 36 CFR Part 1194; in other words, it must be Section 508 compliant. If an item is not compliant you must submit a completed waiver signed by the NIST 508 Coordinator (Dan Benigni). See information concerning 508 at the NIST webpage and http://www.section508.gov/. These systems will be integrated with two other HP systems that were procured on the open market, and will be managed by the management system that was included in the original procurment, the HP Systems Integrated Lights Out software.  Acquiringother computer brands will require acquiring another management system that is not compatible with the existing management software.  Having two different, incompatible management systems will complicate our effort to simplify our hardware and operating system architecture to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.

Please note that any such evaluation criteria must be articulated in the solicitation to the extent required by such regulations and/or guidelines. One of the management strategies that are used by the Department's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) is to use hardware in the office that are the same or similar so parts can easily be exchanged between computers as problems occur and versions are kept standard.  In 2005 the HIU purchased several Dell computers and have followed this trend in 2006 with the purchase of another 9 Dell computers earlier this spring. Recently the HIU have identified the need for additional computers and would like to purchase the same Dell computers that were started this year as part of the office hardware management strategy.  The Dells used in the HIU office have proven to be reliable, but if there is a problem we can substitute the CPU with a matching a CPU and swap the hard drives between the Dells, thus reducing down time. This ease can only be achieved if the HIU office continues to purchase Dell computers.  The HIU also uses Dell servers and have found that the service offered on all equipment has been very reliable.  Using this hardware management strategy it is less costly to the Government to build upon and continue to use previously well functioning equipment than it is to introduce new manufactures. SHIPPING MUST BE FOB DESTINATION CONUS.

Statement of Work

1.  General

English is an essential skill for workforce development.  USAID through its strategic plan, in particular with focus on competitiveness and workforce, is ideally suited to field test English as a Second Language Computer Based Learning (E-CBL) tools that may provide this critical job-skill for Sri Lankan youth from age eighteen to thirty, from all ethnicities and genders, particularly in rural areas. Sri Lankan employers often complain that they cannot obtain a workforce with the necessary job skills and new entrants to the workforce are frustrated that they cannot obtain decent jobs. Matching supply and demand is a core element of the USAID strategy, particularly in the Economic Growth program’s focus on workforce development. Learning English is no longer limited to ‘chalk and talk’ or radio instruction. With global affordable computerization and ‘Internetization,’ tools such as CD-ROM and the Internet have emerged to cost-effectively deliver English language instruction to the widest number of Sri Lankans. 

2.  Objectives

Provide the instructors/teachers of young adults with training to use supplemental English language instruction through English as a Second Language – Computer Based Learning (E-CBL). This program will be used to improve the overall English language proficiency of instructors so that they may better enable young adults to become competitive for jobs in the Sri Lankan workplace.

Deliver for young adult use an E-CBL instructional program that can be used in either a blended instructional setting or as a stand-alone for self study.

Travel to targeted sites in Sri Lanka to train teachers, IT staff and other participants to install and support software, as well as effectively use the software in blended English language instruction.

Report on the efficacy of the New Dynamic English, Dynamic Business English and Hospitality English training among the trained participants.  Indicate the need for adaptation of the software, teacher’s guide or teacher training upon assessment of the training using standard methods.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  This requirement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541513 (formerly SIC code 7376) at a $23,000,000.00 size standard.  

The offerors shall provide separate pricing for each of the contract line item numbers (CLINs):  0001 - Contractor shall provide all professional services in accordance with the Statement of Objectives (SOO) entitled Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) Knowledge Discovery and Knowledge Visualization Research and Evaluation Services, dated April 14, 2006; 0001AA - Direct Labor Costs; 0001AB - Other Direct Costs.   

Statement Of Objectives (SOO) for Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) Knowledge Discovery and Knowledge Visualization Research and Evaluation Services, April 14, 2006

1. PURPOSE: The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) proposes to obtain technical, project management, and product evaluation services for improving intelligence analysis capabilities.

2. BACKGROUND: The primary mission of Defense Intelligence is to provide timely and accurate global threat intelligence support to Department of Defense policy-makers and operational commanders at all echelons of command: national, theater, and tactical during peace, crisis, and war whether involved in unilateral, bilateral, or multinational operations.  As such, Defense Intelligence analysts are responsible for all aspects of intelligence analysis across a wide spectrum of targets.  The rapid introduction of advanced technology is crucial to accomplishing DIA’s Strategic Plan to be the premier provider of defense intelligence.  However, prior to introduction this advanced technology, it must be evaluated to ensure that it functions properly in the typical work environment, and that it truly improves analytical capabilities.

3. OBJECTIVE:  The overall objective of this task involves the Contractor conducting planning, project management, product evaluations, and technology exploitation for moving useful technologies from other Government Research and Development (R&D) efforts, industry, and academia to DIA’s operational computing environment via rapid evaluation and fielding recommendations, to be done as part of the overall General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP) Information Technology (IT) evaluation program.  

4. SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall provide a statement of work (SOW) that explains how they will accomplish the work under this SOO.  The contractor shall provide a Quality Control Plan that explains and dictates how the contractor will evaluate and inspect performance. The contractor shall provide those performance measures that they feel are necessary to measure performance. The Contractor shall perform the following tasks for this effort:

4.1 Project Planning.  The Contractor shall develop and sustain the DIA-based portion of an operational evaluation network in conjunction with the Disruptive Technologies Office (DTO).  This evaluation network will be used for evaluating new analytical tools via several operational evaluation spirals, the integration of data and advanced analytic tools within this network, methods for all members of Defense Intelligence agencies to participate, and the development of “to be” business processes.  All project planning will consider and be coordinated with other DIA-DS project plans.  Additionally, activities by other members of the Intelligence Community (Dept. of Homeland Security, IC-CIO, Intelink Management Office, etc.) will be considered, and where applicable, factored into the operational evaluation network plan.  The Contractor shall develop a performance-based management system that provides best value to the government.

4.2 Operational Evaluations.  The Contractor shall rapidly conduct spirals of operational evaluations of advanced analytic tools on the operational network or on stand-alone networks.  For planning purposes, the spirals should be 3-4 months in duration.  In the Project Management Plan, the contractor shall propose the specific time frames for each spiral.  The Contractor shall conduct risk reduction evaluations of some technologies before exposing them to Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence analysts for further operational evaluation.  The Contractor shall create and manage the execution of operational test plan(s).  Under the direction of the contracting officer's representative (COR), the contractor may also participate in operational evaluations being conducted by other contractors in the laboratory.  These advanced analytical tools will be evaluated for how well the tools improve the quality of analysis done in Defense Intelligence.

4.2.1 The analytical tools will be part of a larger DoDIIS environment.  The underlying security and enterprise services and data environment are being developed by DIA’s Research and Requirements Group.  The contractor will need to maintain situational awareness of these on-going efforts to ensure that the tools being evaluated are compatible with DIA’s DoDIIS Enterprise Architecture and the move to a Service Oriented Architecture.   

4.3 Technology Exploitation.  As identified by the COR, the Contractor may be required to manage other outside contractors that have been identified as having applications that have a high likelihood of meeting high priority analytical requirements.  These outside contractors will typically be small start-up companies that do not have personnel with clearances, or who do not have system engineers who can support multiple installations of the software.  The Contractor will:

4.3.1	Manage technology providers for rapid support in software training, technical integration, tool modification, evaluation and metrics tasks.

4.3.2	Manage the acquisition of limited hardware and software licenses that are required for quick reaction to Government requirements.

4.3.3	Manage sub-contractors that are essential to the above tasks especially as related to integration and operation of software identified through the above processes.  

4.4	Evaluation environment.  The contractor shall support and sustain the advanced analytical tools evaluation environment currently in place at the Defense Intellience Agency Center (DIAC).  Upon direction of the COR, the contractor shall expand the node by adding additional servers or workstations at DIA.  See Exhibit A for the equipment list.  

5. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance for this effort shall be 12 months after date of award.

6. PERSONNEL: The contractor shall have its proposed team in place within five (5) days after contract start date.  All members of the proposed team shall have the necessary security clearances (see paragraph 7) at contract start date.  The Contractor shall strive to maintain the same team throughout the period of performance on this task.  If changes are necessary, the COR must approve the personnel proposed by the contractor.  The contractor shall provide replacements for all contractor personnel removed from this contract.  The contractor shall provide personnel with equal or better qualifications than those being replaced.  The COR shall not accept a lesser qualified person, unless otherwise approved by the contracting officer (CO).

7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: The work described in this Statement of Objectives is classified up to Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) and will require the selected contractor to provide personnel with the valid TS-SI/TK clearances by contract start date.  Contractor personnel shall sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to beginning work on the contract.

8. REQUIRED TRAVEL: The Contractor may be required to travel to Government or industry sites located in the United States.  The contractor is responsible for the administrations of all travel costs.  Travel expenses will be based on the current Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) for all employees.  Claims for local travel (within 50 miles of the DIAC) are not authorized.

9. DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE: (See included schedule of deliverables, Exhibit B).  

9.1  Program Management Plan (PMP).  The Contractor Project Manager shall collaborate with the COR to develop and maintain a detailed work plan to include specific tasks, assignments, and schedules. The Contractor shall develop a Project Management Plan (PMP) within 15 calendar days of award of the order resulting from this statement of objectives (SOO).  The program management plan shall detail the proposed schedule for the initial operational evaluation spiral.  The plan shall include applications to be evaluated, and the metrics to be captured and assessed for each application.  The PMP shall also include a proposed performance based management system for this work to be performed under this SOO. The COR will either approve or submit changes to the PMP within 5 days of receipt.  The Contractor shall update the PMP within 5 days after a change is required.  The Contractor Project Manager is responsible for providing appropriate labor skills to accomplish the work.  This activity will take place primarily in a government furnished laboratory which will be shared with other contractors.  The contractor will need to work cooperatively with the other contractors under the direction of the COR.

9.2  Project Planning Roadmap.  The Contractor shall deliver and maintain a project planning roadmap that presents tasks, milestones, and resources for the primary aspects of the tasks that result from this SOO.

9.3  Operational Evaluation Reports.  The Contractor shall produce and deliver operational evaluation reports for each spiral of operational evaluation conducted.  Each report will compare the metrics of the prototype application(s) to current operational applications.  The metrics collected need to address both functional (how well do the analysts like the new application and does the application improve the quality of analysis) and technical (how well does the proposed application fit into the current and future DoDIIS baseline) aspects of the applications.  For those application(s) that provide “value added” to the current DoDIIS baseline, the Operational Evaluation Report shall be presented at a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) conducted by the Government.

9.3.1  During the PDR, the government shall make a determination on whether the proposed application should be deployed to the operational DoDIIS environment.  For those applications that are approved, the vendor shall develop the following set of software documentation and present that information at a Critical Design Review conducted by the Government:  Implementation design; functional design; security design; and data design.  The security design and the data design will be based upon the on-going efforts by DIA’s Requirements and Research group to implement a security layer and a data layer for DoDIIS.

9.4  Technology Exploitation Reports.  The Contractor shall produce and deliver a technology exploitation report that describes the performance metrics of the application and the readiness of the application to move into an operational evaluation spiral.

9.5  Project Status.  The Contractor shall deliver a monthly project status to the COR.  The project status shall include funds expended, accomplishments during the previous month, planned activities for the next month, and issues that could affect cost, schedule, or performance on the contract.

10. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY/EQUIPMENT/DATA: The Government shall provide space for the contractors to perform the work on this SOO.  

11. INVOICE AND PAYMENTS: The COR will be responsible for certifying payment invoices to DFAS.  Travel may only be taken at the direction of the COR, and prior approval of the COR must be obtained.

FAR PROVISIONS: The provisions at 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2006); 52.212-3, OFFERORS REPRESENTATION AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERICAL ITEMS (MAR 2005); 52.212-1, SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) and 52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996) are hereby incorporated.  Clause 52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (applies to this solicitation, specifically the following criteria: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Security, technical, past performance and price; with technical and security being equally important, and past performance less important than either technical or security.  The Government will award to the offeror submitting the best value proposal. The Government will perform a trade-off analysis of non-price factors against price to determine the best value to the Government.  Offers that are unrealistically low in total price will be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk in meeting contract requirements and will not be considered for award.  Non-price factors (Security, Technical and Past Performance), when combined, are more important than price.  Of the non-price factors, security is more important than Past Performance.  The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase as the relative differences in non-price factors of offerors decreases.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 611310.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) requires a contractor to provide the Ranched Bluefin Tune Economics Study.   The tasks are as follows:  1).  An assessment of the Atlantic Bluefin Tune market will be developed to determine how the price received by US Atlantic Bluefin Tuna harvesters is influenced by products attributes (i.e. size of fat content), time of the year and supply from competing areas such as Japan, Australia or the EU.  2). A model of an offshore Atlantic Bluefin Tune aquaculture facility based on the capture of wild ABT will be developed.  The model will incorporate the demand parameters identified in (1) above, as well as cost and production parameters.  It will be used to evaluate profit maximization and/or cost minimization subject to input, output and/or regulatory constraints.  The model will explicitly compare the profitability of ABT tuna aquaculture based on harvest of wild stock and closed- loop tuna culture systems. 3). A model of industry dynamics will be developed and parameterized to explore such issues as the potential size and scale of the industry.  4). The above analysis will integrate into a single computer based on model of a wild capture ABT aquaculture operation of Northwestern Atlantic Bluefin tuna.  5).The contractor shall provide copies of all research materials and a draft report.  A final report will be submitted by the contractor.  6). Upon completion of the project, a comprehensive report describing the economics of Atlantic Bluefin tuna, an operational computer based model, the software necessary to run the model, and the computer code and any and all data associated with the model will be provided to the contracting office.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking Privacy Expert services.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 and supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This procurement is being conducted as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation, identified as SSA-RFQ-06-1330.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One twelve (12) month base period with two (2) one-year option periods.  CONTRACT TYPE:  The Government intends to award approximately two (2), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) labor-hour type contracts (incorporating fixed loaded labor rates). The number of hours to be procured in the base year will be 24 hours.  For each option period, the minimum number of hours to be required is 16 and the maximum number of hours to be required is 24.  BACKGROUND: In order to process claims for disability, the Social Security Administration (SSA) solicits medical information from doctors and other health care providers.  SSA has legal and regulatory requirements to share payment and eligibility information with other federal, state and local agencies.  SSA’s records are subject to the rules of confidentiality of the Federal Privacy Act.  Many of these records are sensitive in nature.  In spite of the safeguards for personal data guaranteed by the Privacy Act and other statutes, public concern for the security of personal data continues.  As a result, SSA has developed Internet services as an alternate service delivery channel.  Further legal drivers such as the Government Paperwork Elimination Act have made it necessary to offer services electronically as well.  Such Internet services magnify the issues of confidentiality and privacy.  OBJECTIVE: Development of the internet as an alternate service delivery channel raises challenges regarding how SSA will continue to shape and affect privacy and disclosure policy to ensure that it continues to make sound decisions regarding the Agency’s internal and external electronic business applications that have privacy and disclosure policy implications, and reflects a continued commitment to the public trust SSA holds as unique guardians of highly sensitive and personal information.  Several issues must be resolved in order to effectively offer Internet services to the public:  1) Authentication: many of the electronic transactions being developed will allow access to personal information found in SSA records (e.g., access to MBR information in the Check Your Social Security Benefit service).  These records are protected by the Privacy Act, which requires written consent for disclosure.  SSA must ensure that it has built in effective user authentication to safeguard users from potential harm due to improper disclosure; 2) Program Integrity: other transactions will allow users direct access to SSA records which will result in changes that could redirect payments (e.g., COA service, Direct Deposit service) or post-entitlement reports that could change the amount of payments.  Authentication is key in this area as well, as SSA needs to ensure that it controls risk and prevents loss of program dollars or liability for furnishing incorrect data; and 3) Image: SSA has earned the reputation for protecting the confidentiality of the information it collects and for providing efficient, accurate service to the public.  As such, it is therefore necessary for SSA to consult with experts in the field of privacy to ensure that it is taking all privacy issues into consideration.  STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall have knowledge of Privacy Act rules and regulations and shall be in touch with current privacy matters as well as ideas, movements, and trends so that he/she can help SSA develop its thinking in the following privacy-related areas.  These are not all-inclusive:  1) SSA’s Identity Database and our Potential Role as Authenticator:  Although SSA collects and retains much unique information that could be used in a general authentication scheme, it is aware of the public’s intolerance to any type of national identity system and has therefore resisted many attempts to use such data in this manner.  SSA seeks continuous input from experts as it monitors public reactions in this area; 2) Conversion of Agency Paper Business Processes to Electronic Platforms:  While individual applications often share common authentication issues, it has been SSA’s experience that each also raises unique concerns about privacy protections.  SSA seeks input from experts about these unique concerns; 3) Data Sharing:  In order to streamline the development of program requirements, SSA seeks to establish online data access to information maintained by other federal, state and local agencies.  This results in similar requests for access to the information SSA holds.  As such, SSA needs to cautiously consider the ramifications of data sharing and seeks input from experts in this area; 4) Employee Privacy:  Monitoring of employee use of Internet, voice mail, email, etc. creates implications about systems of records for collection of personal data and public notice of these records.  SSA seeks expert opinion of these issues; 5) Medical Privacy:  The HIPAA Privacy Regulations established certain privacy standards that impact on the agency’s collaboration with the medical industry towards adjudicating disability applications.  Even though SSA is not a covered entity under the privacy regulations, it is obligated to ensure the integrity and privacy of the medical information that is transmitted electronically to it to achieve program goals.  SSA seeks expert opinion on this topic as we move forward; 6) Privatization/Personal Savings Accounts:  Although SSA does not know at this time what form such a modification would take, it believes that there will be a need to set up a public/private sector partnership for the exchange of financial information in an investment process.  SSA seeks expert opinion in the financial privacy community to ensure that it address the new categories of personal information created and how the Privacy Act applies; 7) Consent Based Release to Third Parties:  SSA is facing increasing demands by third parties for beneficiaries’ personal information from its program records.  (Examples: insurance companies, pension plans, etc.).  As such, SSA needs to anticipate the political and business pressure that may surface as this type of demand increases, and seeks expert opinion to assist in developing the best strategies; and 8) Collection, Maintenance and Use of Biometric Identifying Information:  Some individuals believe that the only sure method of authentication is based on biometric identifiers such as fingerprints or retinal imaging.  If SSA were to undertake this type of data collection and storage, it would need to address all the issues inherent in this process.  SSA seeks expert opinion about this subject area.  All of the issues above challenge SSA to anticipate how and where the public’s privacy concerns will develop in the next few years so that it can position itself to respond to the American public in an acceptable manner.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide advice and consultation on an as needed basis.  SSA will initiate contact when issues need to be considered.  Most of this contact will be in the form of a conference call, with some face-to-face meetings.  Background material will be sent out in advance to allow preparation for the discussion.  The contractor will provide its thoughts and guidance based on this material during the conference call or meeting.  The frequency of these discussions cannot be fully predicted at this time, as it depends on what issues surface as we develop Internet services.  However, it is expected that conference calls or meetings would be held no more than once per quarter and only when a specific set of concerns need to be addressed.  The contractor will be notified prior to the conference call or meeting if a written record of the discussion is needed.  Occasionally, SSA may send a document to the contractor requesting a written opinion.  SSA will explain the issues involved and provide a due date for the response.  The contractor will review the areas of concern outlined in the document and prepare a written analysis.  If the contractor thinks there are additional items to be addressed beyond what is included in this document, the contractor shall submit them to the Project Officer for pre-approval.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS: The clauses at FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions --Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. FAR 52.212-5 applies as follows:  (a); (b)(14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (26), and (31).

An offeror's proposal may not be considered when the proposed price is unreasonably high or unrealistically low.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  Since the technical criteria are considered to be of greatest importance, the Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the offeror offering the lowest price. However, in the event quotes are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price  will become a major consideration in selecting the successful offeror. Clauses FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov. 1999): The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days. (End of Clause) FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000): a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 7 days; provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years.   INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF DELIVERABLES   The Government will review finalized deliverables within 7 calendar days of receipt and will notify the Contractor of acceptance or rejection.  The Government will not issue notice of acceptance until all required deliverables associated with the work order are received.  In the event of rejection of any deliverables, the Contractor(s) shall be notified in writing and shall have up to 7 calendar days to correct the deficiencies at no cost to the Government.  The Government shall have 7 calendar days to review subsequent submissions of the same deliverables. PENALTIES   If the Contractor(s) fails to furnish to the BVA; an accurately transcribed paper copy of each hearing, the corresponding 3.5" diskette in MS Word 2003 format (where applicable, an electronic copy can be submitted by means of the VA virtual private network utilizing the hearing transcript management software in use at the Board), and the original audiocassette tapes or digital media for the entire work order within the specified time limit, the payment shall be reduced by 3% for each calendar day of delay in receipt.  If it is necessary to have the hearing(s) transcribed by another Contractor, the original Contractor will have no claim for payment for the transcription of the unsatisfactory hearing(s). CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE All audiocassette tapes will be returned to the BVA.  Once a transcript is accepted by BVA, the Contractor(s) will purge all paper and electronic systems of the hearing transcript.  The Contractor(s) will not retain any information or personal identifiers that are subject to the Privacy Act. Confidentiality:  The transcriber shall hold in the strictest confidence all information relating to the individuals and issues involved in the BVA proceeding that he/she may gain in the performance of his/her services. The Contractor(s) will ensure that contract personnel have met VA training requirements pertaining to the Privacy Act and VA Cyber Security Awareness, which are available via the VA virtual private network and can be completed in approximately one hour each.

<DESC>This amendment is to provide answers to questions from potential offerors and extend the response date to 3:00 PM EST.26 June 2006. Q1.    Para 2.1.2.1 states testing to NRL 8093 Test 1, 2, 3a and 3b.  We do not recognize tests 3a and 3b.  The 8093 document only describes a test 3.  Please verify if you have are referencing a new or updated different version of NRL 8093. A1.  We agree there is only a test 1, 2 and 3.  Please correct. Q2.    You have specified delivery not being made until October 2007.  Can the materials be manufactured according to a normal schedule, invoiced, and be stored until the specified delivery date.  The reason for this request is that if we must wait to manu facture these materials until 2007 we cannot be guaranteed that our current raw material prices will remain unchanged.  Our vendors will only hold their current prices for 60-90 days.   A2.  Contractor can include a separate line item for the material to be properly stored until the specific delivery date, but the Government will not take title of the items until the final acceptance which will occur after testing of the material.  Upon f  inal acceptance invoicing and payment occurs.
