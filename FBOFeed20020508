<DESC>LARGE FORMAT RESISTIVE-EMITTER ARRAY (LFRA)
INFRARED SCENE PROJECTOR (IRSP) 

The U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) intends to award a sole source contract to Santa Barbara Infrared, Inc. 312-A North Nopal Street, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 to perform research, design, development, management, testing, integration, documentation and delivery of Large Format Resistive-Emitter Array (LFRA) Infrared Scene Projector (IRSP) systems.  The LFRA  IRSP program is part of the Infrared Sensor Stimulator (IRSS) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) Project sponsored by Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  The IRSS P3I project falls under the Joint Installed System Test Facility (JISTF) umbrella of the CTEIP effort.  The IRSS P3I is designed to support the Tri-services? installed electro-optical (EO) imaging sensors Test and Evaluation (T&E) instrumentation requirements.  The Air Combat Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF), Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD is the Lead for Program Management (PM).  The Electronic Combat Integrated Test (ECIT), Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is the Deputy PM.  The U.S. Army STRICOM serves as the Technical and Engineering Lead. 

Presently, T&E organizations from each of the three services utilize resistive-array-based Infrared Scene Projectors (IRSP) for developmental testing of tactical IR sensors in the laboratory environment.  The IR resistive array consists of a packaged integrated circuit utilizing several hundred thousand micro-resistors (micro-emitters) which each emit individually controlled IR energy in response to controlled current flow.   Combining the resistor array with a scene generator, drive electronics, and matching collimator optics provides an IRSP with the capability to project realistic IR scenes into the entrance aperture of a sensor under test that are dynamic, and radiometrically correct.  Consequently, the resistive array based IRSP has proven to be the most versatile, realistic, and cost effective means of testing IR sensors in the laboratory.

The state-of-the-art in IR scene projection is represented in IRSPs utilizing resistive arrays containing up to 672x544 pixels.  These devices are sufficient for testing many presently fielded sensor systems.  However, they do not provide the necessary resolution and field-of-view (FOV) coverage to adequately test advanced-sensors presently under development (i.e., Target Acquisition Sensors, Threat Warning Sensors, Directed IR Countermeasures Sensors, IR Search and Track Sensors, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Sensors, and Missile Seekers).  Subsystem test laboratories, and installed systems test facilities, both need higher resolution IRSPs (up to 1024x2048 pixel format in the near term, with a growth path to 2048x2048 pixel format) to cost effectively test the next generation of sensor systems in the confines of the laboratory, depot, chamber, hangar, and dock.

The IRSS P3I Project is a ?Follow-On? upgrade to complete the required performance capability requirements of the Full Operational Capability (FOC) IRSS system.  IRSS P3I will satisfy the requirements for Full Field of View (F-FOV) scene projection in the middle to long wavelength IR (M/LWIR) spectrums.  It also addresses corresponding upgrades commensurate to the increased data throughput and computational requirements for the supporting command and control electronics (C&CE) capabilities.

Santa Barbara Infrared, Inc. (A HEICO Company) is located in Santa Barbara, CA., and is classified as a large business.  The company is an experienced, and a leading, supplier of standard, and custom equipment, for testing IR/Visible/Laser electro-optical systems, and is the only viable candidate that can meet the LFRA IRSP performance capability requirements as evidenced by the results of the recent ?sources sought/request for information?.   Santa Barbara Infrared, Inc is the only company that has the requisite technical capabilities and expertise to meet the following LFRA IRSP requirements:

&#61623; Micro-resistive array for a scene projector with a large format configuration of 1024x1024 and 1024x2048 pixel formats with growth path to 2048x2048 pixel formats or larger.
&#61623; Technically sound design, approaches and processes to fabricate, package and cool the large format arrays.
&#61623; Continuous emission over the entire 3 to 12 micron spectral range.
&#61623; Emit dynamic and radiometrically accurate IR images of targets and battlefield/test environments that replicate scenes as presented to the sensors in real world scenarios.
&#61623; Technically sound design and approaches to perform projection at real time frame rates of up to 200 Hz.
&#61623; Windowing techniques at 400 Hz. frame rates or higher for applications that require lower resolution (e.g., 512x1024) stimulation.
&#61623; Emphasis on uniformity, pixel yield, and heat load.
&#61623; Form, fit and function that provide portability, mobility and reconfigurability needed to fully support installed system testing.
&#61623; The scene signal/imagery will be in digital format and transmitted to the LFRA via fiber.  It is preferred that digital to analog conversion of the signal be performed on or near the back-plane area of the LFRA.
&#61623; Required delivery by July 2003 of a scene projector with a large format configuration of 1024x1024.

Based on the results of the ?sources sought/request for information?, which established that there is only one viable company that can perform and meet the above requirements, the US Army STRICOM intends to pursue a sole source acquisition strategy and intends to award the LFRA IRSP effort to Santa Barbara Infrared, Inc.  Any further questions or responses should be addressed to: NAWCTSD, Code 2536, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or e-mail to Mr. Felix Marrero, Contract Specialist, at Felix_Marrero@stricom.army.mil and/or Mrs. Shirley L. Eaton, Contracting Officer, at Shirley_Eaton@stricom.army.mil.  Please provide responses no later than 1300 hours, 24 June 2002.

<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a hand-held CZT isotope detector capable of identifying gamma and neutron radiation emitted by radioactive materials.  In real time, this device produces high quality data in a portable device that is not sensitive to extreme variations in temperature or environment.  The detector hardware includes a CZT detector housed within the charge-sensing preamplifier, read-out electronics to conduct the measurements of any radioactive materials present and to provide the analysis of those samples, as well as a multi-channel analyzer (MCA)/microcomputer.  

This device allows users operating the device to identify if a radiation source is near, how close that source of radiation is, what the radiation source is, as well as how much of the radiation source there is based on the data collected by the detector and analyzed by an on-board microcomputer. 

This device uses Palm Pilot? REDEYE software  (a registered Palm Application).  REDEYE communicates with the embedded microcomputer in the CZT spectrometer to control the operation of the CZT spectrometer.  Three modes are currently available: a Search mode for detecting radiation, a Scan mode for locating the hot spot, and an Identification mode for determining the type of material.  Additional modes, analysis or language options can be easily added to the Palm Pilot?.  

3 Lithium Manganese dioxide (LiMnO2) batteries provide power to the system currently providing approximately 8-10 hours of continuous operation of the handheld device.  

The CZT Palm Pilot? Spectrometer is completely self-contained in a waterproof, rugged anodized high strength aluminum enclosure that consists of a detector module mounting the front of the main body with a top mounting microcomputer.  
The three main assemblies contained in the hand-held device are the electron-only charge-sensing preamplifier, a battery power supply, and a MCA/microcomputer. 

Advantages
1. The device developed at LANL permits real-time detection of radiation sources in a durable, hand-held device. 
2. State-of the art electronics are incorporated into the device making it suitable for field measurement and analysis of radioactive sources.
3. The LANL technology is better than status quo scintillator technology because it provides superior resolution.
4. The LANL technology is better than status quo HPGe (high-purity germanium) detector technology because of its ruggedness and durability as well as the environments in which the CZT Palm Pilot? can be operated and by whom the Palm Pilot? CZT Spectrometer can be operated (HPGe technology suffers too much from the fragility and cooling requirements of the detector and the complexity of the spectrum analysis required by HPGe detectors requires significant training on the part of the user to obtain quality data. 
5. The LANL technology would allow for less expensive devices to be made than status quo HPGe detectors.

Status
The University of California, as operator of Los Alamos National Laboratory, has filed a patent application on this technology in the United States only.  Foreign patent rights may still be available.  The University has also developed and integrated software that is necessary to operate the patent pending hardware.  The University plans to offer this technology for license on a non-exclusive basis.  However, license proposals for field-of-use exclusive license rights will be evaluated and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<DESC>This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The AN/AQS-20/X tow cable is custom manufactured by Cogent Defense systems.  The tow cable purchases include both the bulkhead connector attached to the tow body and its mating, or wet end connector located on one end of the tow cable. These connectors utilize a proprietary fiber optic technology necessary to withstand the harsh submarine environment and the tremendous forces generated by towing.  This technology is solely manufactured by Cogent Defense Systems.  The costs associated with having another contractor reverse engineer the wet end connector required to mate with the tow body would be excessive and would negate any benefits associated with a competitive procurement.

REFERENCE: USAID/HONDURAS SOLICITATION NO. 522-02-021 MANAGER POSITION FOR HONDURAS

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Honduras (USAID/Honduras) is seeking applications (Optional Form 612, Standard Form 171, or Resume) for a Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) of a U.S. Manager for the Municipal Infraestructure Rehabilitation and Constructiong through FHIS in Honduras.  Submissions shall be in accordance with Scope of Work herewith to the following address:
Office of Contract Management, USAID/Honduras, Unit 2927, APO AA 34022 or by fax no. 011 (504) 236-7776.

SCOPE OF WORK
U. S. Manager
FHIS Executing Unit
Municipal Development Activity:
"Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Contraction through FHIS"

Background:  Municipal Development Activity

Devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in late-October 1998, and the associated flooding which continued through January 1999, resulted in the deaths of thousands of Hondurans, left nearly a million people temporarily homeless and caused incalculable crop, equipment, and infrastructure damage. The impact on water, drainage, and sanitation systems in Honduras was particularly severe.

The Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Contraction through FHIS of the Municipal Development Activity (MDA INFRASTRUCTURE Infrastructure) of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program is supporting the construction of works related with the repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of water, drainage, sewerage and landfill systems damaged by Hurricane Mitch as well as the establishment of new systems in sites where families displaced by the hurricane have been relocated.

It is expected that approximately 30 municipalities will benefit from major repair, rehabilitation, improvement and expansion of their basic water, drainage and sanitation systems.  Design and construction of the systems will be contracted by the FHIS Executing Unit in close collaboration with municipal governments.

Expected results include: 1) rehabilitation and expansion of approximately 24 urban water supply and 27 urban sanitation systems that will be operated by municipal governments; 2) construction of eight new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations; and 3) comprehensive storm drainage systems constructed in five secondary cities. 

Private sectors firms will be contracted to execute reconstruction and regular assistance activities; day-to-day supervision will be provided primarily by individual contract consulting engineers and supervisors.  An estimated 20 firms are expected to be involved, including contractors and supervisory firms.

FHIS Executing Unit

The implementation of these construction projects had originally been undertaken by the Directorate for Major Infrastructure (DIM) of the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS).  Under the direction of the DIM/FHIS, approximately 12 water systems, 15 sanitation systems, 5 new water and sanitation systems for resettled populations, and 3 drainage systems have been contracted and completed for a value of US$40 million.  In an effort to improve the timely contracting and execution of the remainder of the water and sanitation systems (with an expected cost of US$30 million), implementation responsibilities have been transferred to an executing unit within FHIS ("FHIS Executing Unit").  This executing unit has been given the necessary authority to contract the remaining water and sanitation construction, and manage existing construction contracts within the established timeframe.  Under the direction of its U.S. citizen Manager (the "Manager"), the FHIS Execution Unit, which responds directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee is the entity responsible for the tendering process, supervision of construction contracts, and completion of the established objectives.

A similar executing unit was established to contract and build the roads and bridges activities of USAID's Hurricane Reconstruction Program.  Through approximately May 31, 2002, this executing unit will be responsible for closing out the roads and bridges component while assuming responsibility for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE.  On or about June 1, 2002, the FHIS Executing Unit will be solely responsible for the implementation of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE.

This executing unit is unique because of its special authority to manage and execute construction contracts.  It is a unit entirely within the supervision of the Minister of FHIS, but is also unique in that all staff, both U.S. and Honduran nationals, are contracted with USAID program funds (i.e., MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE funds).

Headed by a U.S. citizen Manager, the FHIS Executing Unit will be comprised of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE-financed Honduran staff to implement the contracting, field supervision, financial administration, and concurrent auditing activities.  A U. S. citizen will also be contracted for the position of Chief Engineer and will serve as the FHIS Executing Unit's chief technical, scientific and engineering expert.  Under the supervision of the Manager, the Chief Engineer will insure that the FHIS Executing Unit inspects, measures and monitors all construction activities and provides regular assistance to assure contract compliance and adherence to acceptable engineering practices; that the engineering staff are effecting proper technical oversight and payment certifications; and that they are dedicating approximately 60% of their time to field inspections during both design and contract implementation phases. To facilitate the engineering oversight, the Manager, with input from the Chief Engineer, will develop standard formats for supervision record keeping and maintenance of daily staff activity and travel records.

The remainder of FHIS Executing Unit staff will include approximately xx senior Honduran water and sanitation engineer experts, xx middle-level Honduran field engineers, two contracts specialist engineer, xx financial officer, and a complement of administrative and support staff.  The FHIS Executing Unit will also include a two-person Internal Concurrent Audit Team (CAT), which unlike the rest of the staff, will report directly to the FHIS Controllers and USAID controllers.  

Role of Manager 

The MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE will be managed by a U. S. citizen Manager, who is chiefly and personally responsible for achieving the results set forth in the agreements, amendments and implementation letters, in accordance with all relevant procedures established in the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE operational manual. Despite being contracted by USAID, the Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee.

The Manager must be a senior, widely experienced and recognized expert in construction/reconstruction program management who without significant external guidance will be capable of using leadership skills, independent judgment and initiative to assume management responsibility for a uniquely ambitious undertaking.  He/she will be responsible for assuming lead responsibility of the FHIS Executing Unit, devising and improving implemention procedures when necessary, and managing in an independent manner its technical, financial, contractual, and supervisory functions, as well as ensuring that established procedures for the internal concurrent audit are followed.

The Manager will be responsible for the supervision of the entire staff of the FHIS Executing Unit in accordance with the procedures established in the operational manual.  These responsibilities include monitoring staff performance, renewing personnel contracts, establishing salaries, and hiring or eliminating staff as needed.  New contracting and separation of all Honduran FHIS Executing Unit staff will be done with the concurrence of FHIS (with the exception of the FHIS Executing Unit Internal Concurrent Audit Team which will be approved by USAID and FHIS Controllers), as established in the operational manual.  Otherwise, the Manager will be expected to supervise and make personnel decisions independently, appealing to the FHIS Minister or his designee on a limited basis, such as for interpretation or clarification of personnel policies.  

The Manager will establish internal procedures for managing the contracting process, including rigorous pre-qualification and bidding processes, and will critically review and approve for payment all invoices and vouchers submitted by contractors and vendors.  No contracts will be executed under this component, and no transfer or disbursements of funds from MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE accounts will be executed without advance written authorization from the Manager.  

The Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee and provide both FHIS and USAID with updates at regular intervals to be determined jointly.  The Manager will promptly bring to the personal attention of the FHIS Minister, USAID, and the CAT, major problems which come to his/her attention which could affect the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE's transparency or achievement of results.

The Manager will work independently with FHIS and other GOH officials, host country entities, municipal governments, USAID and other donor agencies as needed.  He/she may be called upon to brief senior U.S. Government officials and Members of the United States Congress visiting Honduras.  The Manager will insure that complex challenges in maintaining transparency and ensuring the durability and quality of these expensive reconstruction investments are overcome.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the water and sanitation systems, the Manager will coordinate closely with the USAID Municipal Development Program.  He/she will use a vigorous, hands-on field-oriented approach, which is expected to include significant field travel. 


Contract Management

The Manager will establish and insure compliance with transparent procedures for:  1) overall supervision of ongoing construction activities including technical oversight and financial monitoring; 2) the contracting and supervision of new water/sewer/drainage systems, flood protection works, and landfills; 3) the contracting and technical oversight of supervisory engineering firms and/or individuals.   The Manager will insure that the pre-qualification process includes verification of the credentials and capabilities of proposed engineering staff.  During the construction phase, the Manager will insure that FHIS Executing Unit staff verify, through on-site inspections, the title and condition of equipment utilized matches or exceeds the equipment included in the proposals.  The Manager will insure that opportunities to bid are publicly advertised to pre-qualified firms, and that bids are processed, considered and adjudicated in accordance with the requirements set forth in the agreements, amendments and implementation letters (which may amended from time to time), and the appropriate sections of the operational manual.  He/she will assure, through management of the FHIS Executing Unit, timely compliance with contract specifications and conditions. 

Financial Management

At the request of FHIS, USAID will advance MDA INFRASTRUCTURE funds into discrete accounts held by a private Honduran bank.  The funds will be used exclusively for specified purposes.  No transfers or disbursement of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE funds will be made without the advance written authorization of the Manager.  The Manager will be responsible for all advances and monthly liquidations and will insure that all funds are used in a cost-effective manner.  The Manager will oversee the administration of a petty cash fund and will assure FHIS Executing Unit responsiveness to requests from the USAID Controller's office for accruals, projections and other financial data. 

The Internal Concurrent Audit Team (CAT), to be established and/or maintained by the Manager, will aggressively and independently review 100% of MDA INFRASTRUCTURE's financial and contract documentation to insure compliance with the Agreement.  The CAT, which reports directly to the FHIS Controller and USAID Controller will also observe and report on contract pre-qualification and bidding procedures and will independently pursue reports of irregularities.  The CAT will submit a monthly report of findings and observations directly to the FHIS Controller and USAID Controller, with copies to the Manager and senior officials of FHIS and USAID.  The Manager will work collaboratively with the CAT to resolve problems and strengthen procedures, when necessary.  

The Manager will review and improve a written professional code of ethics developed under RECAP and assure staff awareness, understanding and adherence to this code, including the strictest compliance with confidentiality and integrity requirements throughout the design, contracting and execution process. 

In accordance with contract provisions and the operational manual, the Manager will promptly request concurrence of FHIS to terminate any contractor or staff whose performance demonstrates a violation of transparency, or any contractor or staff who exhibits, in the Manager's opinion, substantial technical deficiencies and/or irregularities.  He/she will work with FHIS to pursue all contract and legal remedies available under Honduran law.
 
Technical Liaison

The Manager will establish and maintain systems to ensure that MDA INFRASTRUCTURE activities are smoothly integrated into regular municipal operations in those municipalities where construction will be executed.  He/she will insure that appropriate coordination with the respective municipal engineers and municipal environmental units is undertaken during the planning and oversight of construction activities.  (This may include coordination with local beneficiary communities as well.)

The Manager will assure that the FHIS Executing Unit liaises effectively with USAID/Honduras personnel, technical scientists, experts and engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as needed.  USACE's engineers will continue to be an expert resource available to the Manager and utilized at his or her own discretion and with the concurrence of USAID, to address technical, financial, or quality control issues.  

Special Challenges

The Manager will face challenges arising out of a contracting process in which transparency and adherence to standards has vulnerabilities.  There are three key challenges facing the Manager and the FHIS Executing Unit:

1. Insuring transparency of contracting and financial management;

2. Developing and adhering to technical specifications and designs which promote the durability and sustainability of the water and sanitation systems; and

3. Preparing environmental reviews for submission to USAID to insure the protection of the local environment.

Duration and Termination

The duration of this contract will be twenty (20) months, with an option to extend, if needed, for an additional six (6) months.

As currently contemplated, this is a USAID direct contract with an individual for non-personal services (non-PSC).  The Contractor shall provide the services described in this Scope of Work to FHIS to assist it in accomplishing the MDA INFRASTRUCTURE.  The Manager will report directly to the FHIS Minister or his designee.  Furthermore, the contract may be terminated, with or without cause, at the convenience of the U.S. Government.

This position is subject to availability of funding for MDA INFRASTRUCTURE implementation.  

Qualifications

A senior, widely experienced and recognized expert in the field of construction/ reconstruction program management who, without significant external guidance, will be capable of using independent judgment and initiative to assume management responsibility for a large-scale ambitious undertaking.

Twelve years of successful hands-on international infrastructure activity management experience, of which five must be in Spanish-speaking Latin America and five in public infrastructure construction.

<DESC>This is a SOLE-SOURCE synopsis.  The Federal Highway Administration intends to negotiate a contract with the University of Virginia to perform a study entitled, "Field Evaluation of DynaMIT in Hampton Roads, Virginia."  The purpose of this effort is to conduct a field test of the DynaMIT software, a traffic information predictor, before proceeding with the wide-scale online field implementation.  The objectives are to conduct an off-line evaluation of the software to evaluate the accuracy of traffic estimation and prediction and to deploy the software for an on-line evaluation of the accuracy of traffic estimation and prediction and to gather feedback from Traffic Management Center operators. The University of Virginia is uniquely qualified for the work required under this project through the traffic research capabilities is possesses at its Smart Travel Laboratory (STL), which was developed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) research.  The facility is equipped with a direct communication link to operational traffic control and management systems in Hampton Roads and Richmond, Virginia.  This link provides researchers with real-time data and video used to support traffic control system decision-making.  Access to the data, as well as the software used in the traffic control systems, supports advanced traffic modeling analyses.  STL has an archive of nearly 4-years of traffic and incident data in the Hampton Roads region that will provide a wealth of scenarios for testing the DynaMIT software.  This combination of having both an extensive compilation of processed data and a direct communication link to the operational traffic control and management systems makes the Smart Travel Laboratory at the University of Virginia a unique source for the performance of this effort.  If any other organization believes that it has the ability to perform this project, please submit one original and one copy of a thorough Statement of Qualifications to the following addressee by 4:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on June 24, 2002: Jill M.

<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, Contact the Contract Specialist, johnson@netl.doe.gov;Denise Riggi, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4241, driggi@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The major goal of the Science Initiative is to advance research and development (R&D) of energy technologies by exploring and exploiting synergies among different research fields, technologies, investigator communities, and end-use applications.  This cross-cutting approach seeks to widen the Department?s R&D activities between energy efficient technologies and clean energy.  This approach seeks to expand and formalize existing cooperation between EERE and FE. The Science Initiative is intended to focus funding and effort on "bridge" R&D that falls between exploratory research, traditionally the province of university researchers, and pre-commercial applied R&D, where private sector firms and research institutions normally devote their efforts.  Often this middle ground of research - crucial to identifying and proving the feasibility of multiple potential applications of a given fundamental scientific discovery - does not receive sufficient emphasis.  For example, there are situations where an existing technology has obvious potential for significant performance and design gains, "if only" an identified hurdle can be overcome by a breakthrough in the application of the science underlying the technology. The primary objective of this solicitation is to pursue "bridge" research and development (R&D), of interest to EERE and FE, with ultimate applications that will promote energy efficiency and clean energy.  This category of R&D occupies the spectrum between exploratory science and pre-commercial applied R&D. There are four general areas of interest (1) Materials Sciences; (2) Fuels and Chemical Sciences; (3) Sensors and Controls Sciences, and (4) Energy Conversion Sciences.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a twelve (12) month, cost-reimbursable type contract for the "Evaluation of Alternatives in Obtaining Structure Elevation Data" for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The requirement calls for a contractor to provide the necessary technical expertise to support a project that will evaluate alternatives in obtaining structural elevation data.  The project will determine if it is appropriate, feasible and legally possible for FEMA to obtain the elevation data on individual structures and to make this elevation information available to properly rate the structure. Specifically, the Contractor will be required to: 1) Prepare and submit a work plan describing the research strategy, approach and proposed schedule to complete outlined requirements in the Statement of Work. 2) Examine the legal issues involved in collecting and making elevation information available and assess approaches for obtaining structure elevation information. 3) Assess the benefits of costs of approaches and recommend an approach for obtaining, maintaining and making available structure elevation data.  4) Prepare and submit a Final Report, per the instructions in the Statement of Work, on the advantages and dis-advantages of the strategies considered, findings and recommendations.  This is a new requirement, and there is no incumbent contractor.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ .  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments.  The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  Potential offerors that do not have the capability to download from FBO, may request, in writing, diskettes containing electronic copies of the solicitation, including attachments, and any amendments.  Potential offerors making this request must include in their written requests an adequate justification for not obtaining the solicitation via the Internet.  Telephone requests for diskettes or inquiries will not be honored.  Requests should be made via email or fax.  Offerors are cautioned to include "Solicitation EMW-2002-RP-0027" on all documentation submitted in response to this requirement.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Comet Assay is a technique for analyzing DNA damage associated with chemical exposure.  DNA damage is assessed in blood samples and tissues from high cancer risk individuals enrolled in large molecular epidemiological studies and in cell culture to better understand the mechanisms toward carcinogenesis.  The Comet Assay Analysis System developed by Loats Associates will greatly increase the efficiency, time and accuracy of Comet analysis for DNA damage.  The instrument will reduce the time needed for analysis of each comet from five (5) minutes (the laboratories current manual method) to that of five (5) seconds as well as significantly improve accuracy of assessment.   This feature is critical for proper assessment of DNA damage in cultured cells and human lymphoblasts.  The following unique features are required and are critical for the laboratory to adapt to full automation: 1) high performance CCD digital camera support, 2) camera thermo-electric cooling to reduce noise, 3) computerized image capture control, 4) one-click capture and processing, 5) automated delineation of comet features over full range of potential DNA damage, 6) extended dynamic range image capture, 7) automated background correction and, 8) visualization and editing capabilities.  Loats Associates, Inc., is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned unique features.  This notice of intent is not a request of competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 23, 2002.  If you have any questions, they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, one (1) original and two (2) copies are to be mailed to the following address: Attn.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research?s (CDER) Office of Pediatric Drug Development and Program Initiatives (OPPDI), in conjunction with FDA?s Office of Women?s Health, are writing a contract to support research on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in pregnant women exposed to certain pharmaceuticals, which could be used to treat diseases or conditions resulting from a terrorist attack. The nation?s recent experience with bioterrorism has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack it will be necessary to treat pregnant women with pharmaceutical agents for diseases or conditions that might otherwise be fatal.  However, little is known about the safety of most drugs either to the woman or to her developing fetus when used during pregnancy. The objectives of the contracted research will be to develop information on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in a cohort of women exposed to a drug of interest during pregnancy using large automated healthcare data systems data.  The highest priority is to evaluate infant outcomes; however, a specific contract could also include a component to assess maternal effects of the drug during pregnancy.  Also, a specific contract could study one or more drugs of interest. The contract shall have an eighteen-month basic period of performance. All responsible organizations may submit an offer in response to the solicitation. (NOTE:  Guidelines will be provided with the solicitation.)  This is a new contract (Contract Number 223-02-3003). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Prospective offers are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments. The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  This requirement will be a full and open competitive requirement.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.

Travel time to a sub-station is estimated to range from 1 to 12 hours over dirt roads that are subject to muddy and slick conditions.  A four-wheel drive vehicle may be required depending on weather conditions.  Upon arrival at the site, the contractor will scan for SF6 gas leaks and have personnel and equipment capable of detecting gas leaks down to a minimum of two pounds per year.  The contractor will provide written and video documentation of scan results.  A single requirements type contract is contemplated consisting of a one-year basic performance period with four option years. For informational purposes, the North American Industrial Classification Code is 541620 and the size standard is $6.0 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Request for Proposal (RFP) planned issue date is 23 May 2002,  with proposals due 24 June 2002, 4:00 p.m. local time.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this RFP is 54171.  The size standard is 500.  The Government intends to award, on or around  3 July 2002, an Indefinite Delivery In definite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with issuance of cost plus fixed fee task orders.  No options are included in this acquisition.  The requirement is for a wideband mobile network prototype system for concept evaluation pursuant to congressional plus up. Negotiations will be limited to Sierra Research, Buffalo, NY, manufacturer of a network solution that is available now, with minor modification, to meet the Governments requirement within the necessary time frame.  There is no other known system that affo rds the capabilities of the Sierra network.  Specifications, plans or drawings relating to the procurement described below are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The first task order will be for proof of concept effort.  If successfu l, subsequent task orders may be issued for continued work within the general scope of the contract. While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  Written proposals should be sent to the address shown above, ATTN: Ms. Pattie Wells.  Proposals may be submitted electronically, email pwells@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Electronic inquiries are encouraged.  Background.  An AMUST Wideband RF (radio frequency) Network will build on lessons  learned during the Armys Rotorcraft Pilots Associate (RPA), Airborne Manned/Unmanned System Technology (AMUST), and Airborne Manned/Unmanned System Technology - Demonstration (AMUST-D) projects.  RPA was largely focused on assisting combat helicopter pi lots in making better, quicker decisions through the use of data fusion and artificial intelligence, when attempting to identify and engage enemy targets.  AMUST was focused on allowing a manned aircraft to control an unmanned aircraft, thereby remaining f arther away from a target and reducing the vulnerability of the crew to hostile fire.  In the AMUST vision each manned vehicle will be able to control, manage, and interact with multiple unmanned vehicles, and unmanned vehicles will interact and collaborat e with each other to execute a common mission. A critical enabling technology for achieving this capability is a wideband, mobile network, which will transmit data and video to numerous nodes in a mode transparent to the user and application software.  Suc h a network must treat each vehicle as an addressable node, and dynamically route and re-route information on multi-node pathways using the least amount of retransmissions to get the message to its destination in the shortest time.  This will be very impor tant in situations where direct transmission is not possible because line-of-sight communications are impeded or transmission distances are great.  It must also be able to broadcast information to multiple nodes at the same time.  Tactical battlefield info rmation must flow from one vehicle through any number of intermediate vehicular network nodes to its intended vehicle without regard for specific paths, much as email and web page information traverses the internet.  In order for a wideband mobile network to be practical for AMUST application, the network must utilize components small enough to be installed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet powerful enough to communicate over long distances.  The network must be ad-hoc to allow participants to enter a nd depart the network without prearranged context and must function without the need for specialized network management equipment so that any two vehicles can come together to form a network.  It must have the capability to allow numerous (100 or more desi red) aircraft to be in the network at the same time.  It must have sufficient bandwidth for  participants to share critical information for airspace deconfliction and mission execution (millions of bits per second or more desired). The system must be resistant to enemy jamming and operate in severe weather conditions, and be capable of supporting  multiple Army rotorcraft platforms.  The period of performance for the first task order for proof of concept is 11 months after date of contract award; the entire contract period of performance is 52 months after date of contract award.  The inspection/ac ceptance and FOB Point are Destination Fort Eustis, VA.  Point of Contact is Mrs. Wells at 757-878-0104, facsimile 757-878-0008, email pwells@aatd.eustis.army.mil. The following CBDNet Numbered Notes apply:  Note 8, 22, and 26.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

This service, if competed, would include generation, transmission (to Northwestern transmission/pickup points only), and scheduling. Malmstrom AFB would prefer that 5% of the power is Green Power, i.e., wind, solar, or biomass power, NOT hydropower, and be 1% of the total supplied load in the first year with a minimum ramp up of 2% per year to 5% by the beginning of the fourth year. Malmstrom AFB would especially be interested in this power at a reduced rate lower than that of the respective customer class default supply rate as to be determined by the PSC final order of Docket No. D2001.10.144.

Malmstrom?s approximate annual consumption for FY 2001 was as follows: Main Base-  49,500,000 KWh, 8077 kW peak demand, GS 2 Transmission Level tariff; Housing- 2,500,000 KWh, 650 kW peak demand, Residential tariff; Missile Complex Sites (102)- 16,400,000 KWh total, 3,220 kW peak demand, GS 1 Secondary Level tariff.  The annual consumption and tariff for the other various agencies can be provided at a later date.

Delivery to the main base load is at the Base Substation at the 100kv level. Delivery to the Housing load is at the meter base on each house at the secondary voltage level. Delivery to the Missile Complex is at the consumption meter base at each of the 102 sites located throughout central Montana at the secondary voltage level.  The meter locations for the other agencies can be supplied at a later date

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for nationwide wireless telecommunication services, including cellular telephone equipment, accessories, and airtime.  The initial requirement is for nationwide wireless telecommunication service for approximately 1,600 users at NAVAIR headquarters at Patuxent River, MD (to include the Webster Field Annex at St. Inigoes, MD), with the option for expansion to NAVAIR users at Cherry Point, NC; China Lake, CA; Lakehurst, NJ; North Island, CA; Orlando, FL; Point Mugu, CA; and San Diego, CA.  Currently, the total effort represents approximately 2,800 users nationwide.  The average monthly airtime minute usage at Patuxent River, MD for the most recent two billing cycles was 214,000 airtime minutes.  Information on prospective wireless service providers will be gathered through capability briefings to be held Wednesday, May 29th and Thursday, May 30th at NAVAIR headquarters, Patuxent River Naval Air Station (NAS).  Briefings shall include: (1) Company profile, company size and description of experience in the wireless telecommunication service industry; (2) Description of existing nationwide coverage area, as well as plans for expansion, and the extent to which the eight identified NAVAIR sites are included therein, (3) Description of equipment offerings, including features, accessories and repair/replacement/warranty information, (4) Description of current wireless service plan(s) and program(s), including standard and optional calling feature details, (5) customary business practices, procedures and/or policies regarding customer service; billing (include example format); ordering of equipment/services; activation and deactivation (include standard times); and equipment/technology obsolescence.  Briefings shall not include pricing information.  Interested wireless service providers shall email company name, point of contact information (telephone number(s) and email addresses) to younglj@navair.navy.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. EST May 17, 2002.  Providers will be notified via email of scheduled time, date and location at least seven (7) calendar days in advance.  A box light projector, laptop computer and screen will be provided for providers who wish to deliver presentations utilizing Microsoft Power Point.  The laptop to be provided supports Microsoft Power Point 98.  The contractor shall provide any other special equipment needed. The use of commercial product literature and product demonstrations is acceptable.  Providers wishing to deliver presentations utilizing Microsoft Power Point shall bring an electronic version of the presentation on a virus-free 3.5 inch disk in an IBM-compatible format.  On the day of its scheduled presentation, each provider will be given fifteen (15) minutes of preparation time in the room where briefings are to be held prior to the briefing.  This preparation time will be followed by Government introduction of the eight (8) Government attendees.  Briefings shall not exceed one hour.  Neither the preparation time nor the Government introduction will count against the briefing time.  At the conclusion of the briefing, the Government will be given an opportunity to ask questions, if any, to clarify information presented in the brief.  The intent of the briefings is to determine if sources capable of satisfying agency requirements exist, develop a better understanding of industry practices, and to arrive at the most suitable approach of acquiring the required products and services.  Providers are limited to not more than five (5) attendees, including presenters.  Providers with planned attendees without Patuxent River NAS decals and identification badges shall provide the name, SSN, date and place of birth of these individuals with their expression of interest so that arrangements can be made for their admittance to the NAS.
