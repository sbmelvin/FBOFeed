<DESC>Notice of Intent to award single source contract to Harney County Gypsum to install two large arch culverts with an attached fish barrier in an existing dike at Mud Lake located on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Award is being made to meet a short time frame while the lake is low before the snow melts and water levels raise.  Harney County Gypsum completed the dike in the spring of 2006 therefore they have first hand knowledge of the site and construction specification.  They still have the original drawings and have knowledge of the site and will save the Fish and Wildlife Service from hiring an engineering firm to write up specifications for this additional work to the dike. The use of another contracting firm would also impact staffs time because of the need for intensive oversight of the project.

<DESC>The U.S Department of Education (ED) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The proposed contract action is for The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences.  NCES's longstanding mission is to "collect, and analyze and disseminate statistics and other information related to education in the United States and in other nations."  ED intends to award the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), on a sole source basis. The IEA has mounted several major large-scale international assessments, most recently the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2006 and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007. TIMSS is an international assessment that focuses on the mathematics and science knowledge and skills of fourth- and eighth-graders. PIRLS is an international assessment that focuses on the reading knowledge and skills of fourth-grade students. The International Association organizes both TIMSS and PISA for IEA, an international organization of universities and governments based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  TIMSS and PIRLS have been designed to track changes in student achievement over time. TIMSS has been administered on a four-year cycle starting in 1995. There have been four cycles of TIMSS thus far (1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007). PIRLS has been administered on a five-year cycle starting in 2001. There have been two cycles of PIRLS (2001 and 2006). In 2007, 63 countries implemented TIMSS at the national level, at either fourth- or eighth-grade, or both. In 2006, 40 countries participated in PIRLS. More information on TIMSS and PIRLS can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/timss and http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pirls.  The IEA maintains sole copyright of TIMSS and PIRLS, including but not limited to the assessment items and questionnaires. The proposed contract is to develop and implement the next round of TIMSS and PIRLS. Through this contract, NCES will work with the IEA to ensure the collection of high-quality data that can inform key U.S. education policy questions.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by submitting a not to exceed 25-page proposal addressing the requirements stipulated above. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received within 10-calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis. A Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, the Government will consider information received by the response date of this presolicitation notice.

Note, responses are due 12:00 Noon on January 28, 2008.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK:  The Government is seeking a qualified contractor to construct a new U.S. Port of Entry, Portal, North Dakota to replace the original border station built in 1932.

If negotiations result in a final price for Phase II construction within Congressional funding limits, the Government intends to exercise the option for Phase II construction pending availability of funds.

Statement of work: 

Item #1 is to include the labor required for the repair, relocation and installation of all Visual Information (VI) Equipment as specified by NCTC?s Media Resources Administrator.  Types of VI Equipment include various makes and models of LCD Projectors, document cameras, smart boards, amplifiers, CCTV Analog and Digital Camera Systems, and other related equipment.

Item #2 is to include all materials and supplies required to repair, install or relocate VI equipment.  Material includes but is not limited to, mounting brackets, various cables, mounting poles and Gyro Mouse Replacements.

Item #3 is for replacement of LCD projector bulbs.  LCD projector bulbs last between 1,000 ? 1,500 hours.  Currently, NCTC has 13 different makes/models of LCD projectors.  A minimum of 1 spare bulb on hand is required at all times so classroom instruction will not be interrupted.  At least half of the LCD projectors are 4 or more years old.

Over the last three years, NCTC has averaged almost 8 service calls per month.  Less than 10% of these trouble calls have been emergency repair calls.  Contractor will respond to emergency repair service calls within 24 hours and respond to routine service calls within 72 hours.

Contractor shall possess proper identification and credentials to acquire a base pass for company work vehicle.  Contractor will furnish all tools and equipment required to perform specified work.  If materials such as cables, connectors, or other related items are required to complete the service, the contractor will provide the Media Resources Administrator with a list of required items prior to purchasing.  Upon completion of the service call, the contractor will provide the Media Resources Administrator with a paper copy of the work order describing work performed and all materials used.

Twelve service calls per month x 12 months = 144 service calls per year
144 service calls x 2 hours per call = 288 hours
288 hours x $45.00 per hour = $12,960.00

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, intends to negotiate a 9 month extension to the contract with Jackson Laboratory of Bar Harbor, Maine to continue operations of the Mouse Model Repository for Cytogenetic Disorders. The extension is required because of delays in a planned FY2007 acquisition for this requirement. The planned extension will permit the repository to continue to function while a new acquisition is conducted for these services. The proposed extension will prevent a lapse in service until the pending sole source five-year contract award to the Jackson Laboratory can be approved. The Jackson Laboratory has been operating the Mouse Mode Repository for Cytogenetic Disorders under Contract N01-HD-7-3265 since 1996. The requirements of the contract are: 1) Continue maintenance of the Repository for Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders for Cytogenetic Resource. 2)Breed various strains of mice with known genetic background, which will produce chromosomally unbalanced gametes, resulting in trisomic and monosomic embryos with special emphasis on chromosome 16, but including relevant regions of chromosome 17 and chromosome 10. 3) Continue to refine procedures to freeze embryos that can be rescued by thawing and reimplanting them in pseudo pregnant mice. 4) Distribute the animal models to qualified investigators by NICHD. Test the animals periodically for pathogens. 5) Publicize the availability of mouse models indicating the type of strains in the colony. 6) Continue to characterize the clinical phenotypes of the mouse models.  Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the mouse models discussed earlier in this JOFOC for the following reasons: A new contractor would have to develop cryopreservation, and maintenance techniques unique to the type of mice in this resource, specifically strains with chromosome aberrations. One would have to acknowledge and plan for the time needed to learn procedures involved in cryopreservation and maintenance of these strains. There would be little room for developing the unique skills associated with cryopreservation of the Robertsonian (Rb) and partially trisomic embryos that could result in a significant loss of the frozen stocks in the resource. Researchers rely on the resource to obtain segmental trisomy and Rb mice primarily for studies related to Down syndrome. Over the past five years over 144 requests for mice from researchers have been fulfilled. A variety of studies using these mice are on-going. Investigators require a foundation colony from which different stocks are derived so genetic drift does not occur among different colonies. If another contractor were to be awarded the proposed extension it would take approximately one-year for them to transfer and process the mice, thereby disrupting the distribution of the mice to researchers and potentially impacting their research. If the mice were to survive the transfer it is not known if another contractor could consistently duplicate the characteristics of the mouse models currently maintained at the Jackson Laboratory. This would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the government's requirements. In addition, it would take another contractor approximately $1M to transfer the mice that would result in a duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition. However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7AO7, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>17 -- Helicopter Services
<SOLNBR>RFQ-81J8-8-0002
<RESPDATE>012808
<ARCHDATE>02122008
<CONTACT>Regan Alexander, Purchasing Agent, Phone 602-437-1376, Fax 602-437-5354, Email ralexander@uswcl.ars.ag.gov
<DESC>Description of Supplies/Services:
Helicopter flights over test sites at the Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC), Arizona are required between January and June 2008.  Up to ten separate flight sorties will be required.  Flight levels are to be flown between 500 and 3000 feet above the ground.  All flights are to be coordinated with ground-level activities at MAC and may require on-site landings on non-public, paved farm roads. Contingent upon safety requirements, helicopter flights will follow paths designed by on-site USDA scientist.  When requested, helicopter flights are to be flown at slowest safe speeds.  Flights are to be scheduled during daytime, mainly between sunrise and 13:00.  Flights are needed during clear, or mostly clear sky days. Helicopter must be able to carry one passenger who will operate USDA-supplied image equipment.  The image equipment package may weigh as much as 50 pounds and must be mounted to provide a clear nadir view for all of its instruments. A mounting bracket, supplied by USDA, must be used and is a steel tube frame approximately 16 in x 16 in with an additional diagonal brace approximately 36 inches long. 

We need to be able to install our own custom camera systems on the helicopter. One company has agreed to these conditions, Heli-Tours based out of Deer Valley airport north of Phoenix, AZ (Brian Mitchell, 602-692-9898).  In FY2003 Heli-Tours built a custom mount and acquired FAA approval; a difficult and required step before flying with our custom mount.  Heli-Tours is uniquely qualified for this contract because they are the only business with the necessary FAA approval to fly the USDA image acquisition package.  This approval process is specific to the aircraft type.  The USDA image package is a unique collection of state-of-the-art research equipment that Heli-Tours has successfully adapted to its helicopter frame.  The order requires equipment mounting that is not readily adapted to standard airborne photogrammetric installations. 

This solicitation has an urgency and timeliness component.  Airborne image data are required over a growing crop between January and May 2008 and are also required during dominantly clear sky conditions.  Heli-Tours has agreed to meet these requirements.  We need to schedule our first flight by the end of January 2008.

This is a multi-year project.  This is a sole-source requirement to the extent that other companies have declined to provide these services.   We are interested in establishing new relationships with companies that are willing to mount our equipment and obtain FFA approval.  

A solicitation is not available for this requirement, but interested firms may submit proposals to the attention of Regan Alexander as listed below.   If no written affirmative responses are received, then this contract will be awarded to Heli-Tours without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is January 28, 2008.  Please provide Regan notice if you need additional time to prepare a proposal.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR PART 13 (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm-fixed purchase order to North America Precis Syndicate, 1819 L Street, NW, Washington, DC  20036 to purchase thirteen articles at about 400 words each (4 minority releases) during the period of performance.  Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  The North America Precis Syndicate (NAPS) provides CMS with a unique distribution outlet to feature key Medicare messages in the form of articles to most local newspapers in the country. NAPS distribution and placement assures regular national media placement of Medicare messages by driving topic selection and content development and securing placement in the local newspapers. With the recent changes to Medicare, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage from the MMA, the DRA, and the new preventive benefits, there is a great need to convey accurate and reliable information to the public about Medicare. Through NAPS, CMS? goal to have confident, informed consumers through more service-oriented education to the public can be achieved by addressing new and important coverage changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs as well as topics based on the top questions asked through the Medicare Call Center and website. This service enables CMS to be more proactive through outreach by providing more comprehensive answers to questions being asked by people with Medicare through guaranteed print placement.  Potential outreach of NAPS includes 10,000 papers (1,500 dailies and 8,500 weeklies) across the United States. Audio news releases can also be distributed to radio stations on CD and in script format to 6,500 stations nationally.  Purchasing more print releases will provide us with more inexpensive vehicles with which we can reach people with Medicare and their caregivers. This includes the African American population. Since 2004, CMS has acquired contracts with the North America Precis Syndicate (NAPS) to distribute articles to provide information to readers about the Medicare program and its various information channels to help extend Medicare messages. Through these agreements, NAPS provided editing, production, mailing, placement, tracking and analysis services.  NAPS
provides national, regional and local outreach of print messaging using consistent and accurate language. With minimal cost to the agency, it helps reach local media with guaranteed placement.  Medicare issues addressed in articles in local dailies (newspapers) are often placed in prominent sections of the paper. This leverages CMS? likelihood of reaching more general and underserved audiences with important Medicare information.  Paid service placement such as NAPS guarantees placement; earned media (non-paid) is at the mercy of the news director and availability of space.  Building awareness of Medicare coverage, including but not limited to the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage, preventive benefits, quality, and value driven health care is a key responsibility by the Department and Agency and supporting HHS and CMS goals and mission and, can be leveraged using this medium. All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System.  CMS program officer shall make the determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise.  The period of performance is for 1 year.  NAICS CODE IS 541820.

The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has a requirement for two types of antennas: ultra high frequency (UHF) high gain satellite antennas and very high frequency (VHF)/UHF (multi-band) whip line of sight (LOS) antennas. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number H92222-08-R-0007 is issued as a Request for Proposal.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-20.  This solicitation may result in multiple awards of commercial, five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for antennas to be equal or comparable to the following four antennas: Trivec-Avant AV 2091-0 antenna, Trivec-Avant AV 2091-1 antenna, Trivec-Avant AV 2091-2 antenna, and the Chelton GD1813 antenna.

Standard Commercial Warranty:  The Contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government?s rights under the ?Inspection? clause nor does it limit the Government?s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty.  The standard commercial warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable material and/or services listed in the Schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with its offer.  

All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be solely distributed through the FedBizOps website.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation, set-aside for small business participation only, to obtain the services of one to three experienced, licensed Cardiologists, who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or cardiological impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalist, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or cardiologist specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 
SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for a 3-month base period, with four 12-month option periods.   SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about January 18, 2008, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release.   Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to s.kyle.roberts@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2900 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairsý systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2900 server equipped with more recent and powerful dual-core Intel Xeon 5150 processors for their superior performance and lower power consumption as the only server that can successfully function as a primary Oracle server (POS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems.  The PowerEdge 2900 server is the ninth generation PowerEdge server manufactured by Dell. The server is equipped with Intel Xeon 5100 series processors, which can help lower power consumption and can deliver up to a 152 percent increase in performance over the previous generation dual-socket Dell PowerEdge servers. The server uses dual core processor technology, combining two processing units into a single processor chip. This technology increases performance and efficient use of power, especially when running several applications on a single server.  Consular Affairs modernized applications rely on the availability and operability of a POS installed at every post where the applications are used.   The POS must function as a primary server, a standby, an external drive and a backup.  This is considered a critical piece of equipment. For support purposes, we must standardize on one configuration.  The Dell 2900 meets all requirements. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 840 server equipped with dual core processor technology (configurable to quad core), as the only server that can successfully function as a secondary Oracle server (SOS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Departmentýs best interests will be served if the Dell PowerEdge 2900 and Dell PowerEdge 840 is procured at this time.  No other server fully meets the Departmentýs requirements.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements.<BR><BR>

1.	QUESTION:	Will the team awarded the contract be expected to provide geo-technical and survey services for the proposed facility?
	ANSWER:	The geo-technical and survey services for the site will not be a part of this contract.

2.	QUESTION:	What is the goal for minority participation, if any?
	ANSWER:	The awardee, if a large business, will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.

3.	QUESTION:	Is there a page limit?
	ANSWER:	There is no page limitation, however, the information required for evaluation is specifically set forth in the announcement and responses should be relevant, thorough, and concise. 
 
4.	QUESTION:	Is there a font size and style required?
	ANSWER:	No.	

5.	QUESTION:	Under "Description" The second sentence under paragraph two reads "The lease will be" etc.   Is the anticipated work to take place in an existing facility or is this for a new building?
	ANSWER:	The site is not yet selected.  It could be a Greenfield site or an existing building.

6.	QUESTION:	In the RFP released on August 7, 2007 for Solicitation Number H07-1150 the estimated Construction range is listed as only $10,000,000.00.  Is this correct?
	ANSWER:	In accordance with the FAR , the construction range shown in the announcement is more than $10,000,000.00.

7.	QUESTION:	I was looking for the following information:
 			1. Contract Value
			2. Acquisition Strategy (small business, full and open competition, set aside)
			3. Technical Point of Contact
	ANSWER:	1. The estimated contract value is not public information.
			2. This procurement is open to all business classifications.
			3.  Technical Point of Contact will be designated after award.

8.	QUESTION:	In the section under project team item number 8 asked us to provide the percent of time committed to this team per week, can we break the time commitment down by phase?
	ANSWER:	Yes.

9.	QUESTION:	Item 9 of the project team section asks for a synopsis of design experience including firm name(s), years with each firm and type of design experience with each firm, how far back are we supposed to go for each team member?
	ANSWER:	5 years

10.	QUESTION:	1.Will there be a pre-proposal conference?  
			2. Is there a more detailed package of submittal requirements?  
			3. Is this a multi-step RFP process? as this solicitation does not appear to require a fee break down, at this time.  
			4.  Will there be a formal interview process once you have selected a limited number of qualified firms?
	ANSWER:	1. See Modification 1.
			2. See Synopsis
			3 &4.  SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm(s) based on the published selection criteria. Past performance will be evaluated. Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms ranked as most highly qualified.  After interviews, the most highly qualified firm will be requested to submit a cost proposal for consideration.

11.	QUESTION:	Are there any page limits or font size limits for this proposal?
	ANSWER:	See numbers 3 and 4 above.

12.	QUESTION:	Specifically we are interested in whether this project opportunity is a fit-out of existing space or will it be new construction.  And is it a requirement that the team have experience in the permitting process in the Frederick area.  Meaning do we need to have a local architect in Frederick on the team?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above. The A/E will be responsible for producing a design that, at the initial submission to the governing authority, will meet all of the standard and unique code requirements of Frederick City or County.  The A/E will also be responsible for substantiating compliance to the governing authority in a timeframe which does not cause delays during the utility and construction permitting process.

13.	QUESTION:	A question was whether you anticipate extending the due date, since the time between the site meeting and the sending of the deliverable is only about 4 working days?  SF 330's are very challenging, and to incorporate the learning from the meeting in such a short time will be quite a challenge, especially with a holiday in between. 
	ANSWER:	A time extension may be considered if questions or issues arise during the pre-proposal conference which would substantially change the response requirements as set forth in the announcement on August 7, 2007.

14.	QUESTION:	The primary question we have is this. Is this project for new construction, or is it the fit-out of a leased facility? The RFP is not quite clear on this issue and it has a very material impact on how we would assemble our proposal. Any chance you could answer this question very soon?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above.

15.	QUESTION:	Does the Government intend to evaluate multiple sites?
	ANSWER:	Yes, multiple sites are being evaluated.

16.	QUESTION:	Will the facilities be housed in new construction on a "greenfield" site, or in existing buildings requiring renovation/fit-out design?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above.

17.	QUESTION:	What is the relationship between the Government, SAIC, and/or a third party regarding: ownership of the site and building(s); and operation of the facilities?	
	ANSWER:	SAIC-Frederick, Inc. will lease and operate the facility for the National Cancer Institute.

18.	QUESTION:	What are the roles of SAIC and NIH-NCI in the evaluation of responses to the solicitation? 
 	ANSWER:	SAIC-Frederick, Inc., in its role as Operations and Technical Support Contractor for the NCI at Frederick will be responsible for evaluation of the responses to the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Chad Pelekai, Contract Manager, Phone (310) 653-3854, Fax null, Email chad.pelekai@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Navstar GPS Block III Space Vehicle Program (GPS III) intends to award a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract modification to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems & Solutions contract FA8807-04-C-0001 for a period of 01 November 2007 to award of GPS III Satellite Production contract.  Lockheed Martin can provide the following supplies without the Government incurring substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)).  GPS Constellation sustainment is driving the need for GPS IIIA Key Decision Point-B (KDP-B).  The delay of KDP-B from August to December 2007 provided an opportunity for further system design risk reduction activities to be performed.  Lockheed Martin is currently on contract and has completed a delta Systems Requirements Review (SRR) in November of 2006 and System Design Review (SDR) in March of 2007.  This action will add approximately five months to the existing GPS III Phase A contract and will build upon Lockheed Martin?s current GPS III Space Vehicle Risk Reduction and System Definition effort scheduled to conclude November 2007.  

Under the contemplated contract action, Lockheed will provide demonstration of lower-level design maturity and analysis of critical technologies and engineering integration processes to ensure time-certain development.  Lockheed Martin will also provide key updates to the SDR baseline to ensure functional and performance allocations are complete and traceable from space system level to sub-system level.  This includes functional and performance requirements flowdown to incorporate evolving requirements as identified in the July 2007 Joint Requirements Oversight Council GPS III Capability Development Document.  Other key products include a mature space system design and navigation payload sub-system design consistent with the contractor's prime item specification and SMC military specifications and standards.  Furthermore, Lockheed Martin will provide necessary Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCE) updates consistent with a high confidence, low risk capability insertion program plan for a FY2014 launch availability and additional LCCE for an accelerated launch availability before FY2014; and mature contractor GPS definition and design products to support on-going Independent Program Assessment and Independent Cost Assessment for the December 2007 KDP-B.

Interested contractors are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing the ability to satisfy the above requirements to GPSW/PK, Attn: Kelly Britton, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  All responses are due no later than 01 February 2008 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12-point, with a maximum of 20 pages.  The SOC must include the following information:  1) company name, mailing address, points of contact, and telephone numbers; 2) business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) experience in GPS Satellites or similar space systems; 4) ability to satisfy the Government?s performance requirements described above.  Oral communications are not acceptable.  All responsible sources may submit a SOC, which will be considered.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 (1000 employees).  Responses by small and small disadvantaged firms is encouraged.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information or reimburse expenses incurred by parties for responses to this synopsis.

<RESPDATE>012808
<CONTACT>Darryl Anderson, (202) 267-7699
<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information. The applicable NAICS is 611430: Professional Development Training. The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. BACKGROUND: The FAA is currently engaged in the development of a solicitation for the upcoming ATCOTS competition. We previously released the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and corresponding data item descriptions, and draft Sections L and M for Industry comment. We stated during the previously held Industry Day that we would solicit comment on a draft Section B, and that we may release other draft sections of the SIR in future announcements.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION: Draft Section B of the ATCOTS solicitation is provided for Industry comment. The FAA is also releasing an updated draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) to facilitate Industry's review of the draft Section B. Interested vendors are requested to provide comments/questions and to make recommendations on all aspects of the draft Section B, including contract type (T&M, FFP, etc.), labor categories, CLIN nomenclature, etc.  While our focus at this particular time is on Section B, we understand that vendors may need to refer to the draft PWS to explain or clarify their comments or recommendations to Section B.  We do encourage comments that highlight or identify ambiguous areas in the draft PWS that relate to Section B as well.   Section C.1.3 of the PWS describes the current training operations that occur at the FAA Academy and the more than 50 field facilities nationwide. The FAA is considering grouping facilities into a geographical classification by level and breaking out the labor categories by geographic location and size of facility. The FAA requests Industry comment on this approach and seeks industry opinion on the pros and cons of this approach.  Also, please note the FAA comment for CLIN 0014 Program Management.

12.	DESCRIPTION: 
The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting a SECOND Industry Day participation relating to the Counterspace Command and Control (C2) Sustainment Contract.  The Industry Day will be held at the Secret/NF level on 30 Jan 08, 9:00 ? 11:00 A.M., at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A8 auditorium, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA.  Following the Industry Day presentation and general Q&A session, the government program team will hold one-on-one sessions, up to the TS/SCI level, with interested prime contractor teams.  Based on the number of interested prime contractor teams, one-on-one discussions will carry over the following day, 31 Jan 07, as needed.  Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 minutes due to the number of interested contractors.   Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel.

On 12 September, 2007, an initial Industry Day for Counterspace C2 Sustainment Contract was conducted.  For the follow on Industry day, the government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the Counterspace C2 systems.

The contract is expected to have a period of performance of 6 years with four 1 year award term options beginning with a contract transition and spiral development efforts starting on 1 Sep 08.  It is expected that system sustainment will begin on 1 Dec 08.  System improvements will be accomplished every 18-24 months throughout the life of the system.  It is expected that spiral development efforts and sustaining engineering efforts will be approximately equal.  Initially the only program supported by this contract is the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS).  The JETSS program is in use at JFCC-Space?s Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) as a mission planning and execution monitoring tool of space control assets.  JETSS consists of previously developed software (JAVA software language with WebLogic basis), relational database (Oracle), server (Sun Solaris operating system)-client (Windows) architecture, and commercial-off-the-shelf software applications integrated into a seamless program.  

In order to perform this effort, prime contractors should have extensive knowledge of service oriented architecture/net-centric enterprise services, federated query systems, relational databases, and Information Assurance requirements.  Firms must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret ? SCI/SAP/SAR accredited SCIF(s).  Additionally, firms must have SAP/SAR approved facilities to perform system depot maintenance.

Companies interested in attending the second Industry Day and participating in the one-on-one sessions must RSVP (company name, attendee names and contact number/e-mail) via email to Barbara Baker, 310 416-1627/ barbara.baker@losangeles.af.mil, no later than 12:00P.M., 24 Jan 08.  In addition, your visit requests should be submitted via JPAS no later than 12:00 P.M., 25 Jan 08.  Send the certification to JPAS SMO code ?SYS Wing?.  If attendees are unable to send visit requests via JPAS, fax to 310 416-1725, Subject: Counterspace Command and Control Sustainment Industry Day, Attn: Steve Taylor.  Attendees will not be accessed to any additional clearances for the second Industry Day, however at the one-on-one meetings the government team will allow discussions to go to the TS/SCI level if the contractor team already has those clearances and submits visit certifications to that level.

  Appropriate small business standard is North American Industry Classification System code 541712, research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences with a size standard of 1,000 employees. Small business and small, disadvantaged business firms interested in the Counter Space Command and Control Sustainment SECOND Industry Day are encouraged to attend.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Subcontracting arrangement with potential primes is also highly encouraged.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  

Validated potential primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the Classified Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors will be expected to submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) prior to receiving the RFP.  Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort.  A full fledged DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS will be required.  If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and is currently accredited by another agency, then that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort upon coordination with SYSW Security.  Contact Mr. Crafton (310) 416-1591, gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil, regarding information/paperwork that will be required.  SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While an accredited SCIF and TS/SCI SSBI cleared personnel are not requirements to participate in the 30 Jan 08 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified RFP without having approved personnel and a secure SCIF in which to store information.  

SYAG/CJD will post the draft unclassified Counterspace C2 Sustainment Request for Proposal (RFP) on FedTeDS.  The draft RFP includes the draft Counterspace C2 Sustainment Performance Based Work Statement, draft Counterspace C2 Sustainment Award Fee Plan and draft Combined Section L and M.  It is the government expectation to receive comments from industry on these documents.  Please submit your comments via email to Barbara Baker, 310 416-1627/ barbara.baker@losangeles.af.mil, no later than 12:00P.M., 28 January 2008.  After the Industry Day, one-on-one sessions with interested prime contractor teams will be held to discuss these documents and the comments received.  Since the draft RFP is unclassified, no security requirements need to be accomplished, however in order to receive the final Classified RFP, the security requirements stated above must be met.  

Interested bidders may ask questions by contacting Ms. Barbara Baker at (310) 416-1627, or the Counterspace C2 Sustainment Buyer, at (310) 416-1703 or email at jack.may@losangeles.af.mil.  All answers are subject to being shared with all prospective bidders. 

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill.  You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. PURPOSE: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division is seeking sources for improved fire control capabilities for sniper weapons not covered by INOD or existing or future Sniper day optics for the Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Snipers (MDNS-Sniper).  Eventually, a five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated.  Production quantities have not yet been determined and will be announced at a later date.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification.  Award will be on a ?best value basis?. TECHNOLOGY INTERESTS:  Technology solutions that include a laser range finder (LRF) integrated with a variable divergence IR illumination laser and an IR aiming/pointing laser with remote controls is of interest.  An integrated visible laser to enhance collimation with telescopic sights and could be used as a target designator is a desired feature.  The system must have single protected adjustment turrets for elevation and windage, with tactile adjustment values of one MOA per increment.   The LRF should have a remotely located LED digital readout visible to operator in firing position providing the operator with range to target and re-ranging capability within three seconds.  Range of the LRF must be <10 m to 2500m> (in optimum atmospheric conditions) with ranging accuracy of +/-2.0 m.   Cone divergence of lasers must provide effective ranging on a one square meter target to 1500 m.   Hard wire or wireless remote controls which can be fired from the pistol grip of the PSR w!  ith the firing hand are required.  Weapon mounting methods must include compatibility with the 1913 rail mount configuration and size which would allow potential internal mounting in the fore end of the PSR. Battery types must be of a standard commercially available type, such as AA or DL 123?s. Systems must be rugged and able to withstand repeated shock of heavy sniper rifle recoil, while exhibiting long battery life. Weight and size minimization are important attributes. Waterproofing to a depth of 66 ft for 2 hours is desired. SCOPE:  The MDNS-SNIPER Project will be conducted in two phases, immediate and long-term.  The immediate phase, Phase 1, will occur over the upcoming months to evaluate and establish a simple, partially-integrated baseline ensemble.  However, if a fully integrated solution is available it will be tested.  Phase 2, will be conducted on a full and open competition basis and will require a fully integrated ensemble meeting the requirements of the MDNS-Sniper Performance Specification. ACTIVITIES: Phase 1 of the program will require that the project utilize an independent Operational Test Agency (OTA) to conduct an Early User Assessment (EUA) of GOTS/COTS/NDI subsystems on or about June or July of 2008.  Vendors desiring to participate in Phase 1 will be required to submit a signed letter statement of intent to participate and two production or production ready samples at a date to be announced.  In addition the vendors will be prepared to conduct condensed training of the products delivered.  The government participants in the EUA will mount, fire, and assess the various subsystems to establish which ensemble most closely meets the current MDNS-SNIPER preliminary performance requirements and the operational tasks and missions outlined in applicable weapons field manuals and operator?s manuals.  The EUA results and other information may be used to develop a Market Survey Report and a performance specification to support full and open competition for Phase !  2 of the program.  The MDNS-Sniper Performance Specification will be published on or about August or September of 2008.  When it is published, interested parties will be invited to comment on the MDNS-Sniper Performance Specification.  Failure to participate Phase 1 will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.   During Phase 1, there is no intent to procure anything other than possibly existing GOTS items.  However, if any COTS/NDI items are found to be operationally superior to existing GOTS items, the Government may choose to procure these COTS/NDI items in relatively small quantities to support continued exploratory testing, or to meet urgent combat needs.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. The longer-term phase, Phase 2, will be conducted on a full and open competition basis as a five year IDIQ program.  It is expected that the competitive solicitation of Phase 2 will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis. PRE SOLICITATION CONFERENCE: NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-Sniper acquisition.  The time/date for this pre-solicitation conference is 4:00-5:00 PM MST, Wednesday, 6 February 2008 (after the S.H.O.T. Show),  in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino at 2000 Las Vegas Blvd, South, Las Vegas Nevada.  Pre registration is not required.  Discussions will include requirement background information, technology readiness, and questions and answers. OTHER NOTES: It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.

<SUBJECT>B -- ADVISORY COMMITTEE
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Headquarters Directorate of Technology has a requirement for a standing committee of prominent scientists, engineers and government officials to provide investigative and advisory services on a wide range of cutting edge science and technologies with the potential to enhance the ability of the command?s operations.  The intended source is the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a private, non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology. Under the authority of its charter granted by Congress in 1863 and Executive Order 12832 (January 19, 1993), the Academy mandate is to advise federal government on scientific and technical matters. This requirement establishes an advisory committee to support USSOCOM technology development similar to those already established for the Departments of the Air Force, Army and Navy. The standing committee shall investigate but not be limited to such activities as determining the technical merit of current USSOCOM efforts relative to state-of-the-art technologies; evaluating efficiency and effectiveness  in which current efforts are carried out and their impact on the mission; judging relevancy of current technologies to the USSOCOM mission; and analyzing the effective and efficient application of command resources to meet mission needs. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Academy is the only source that can satisfy the agency needs. USSOCOM will rely on the experience and the unique attributes of the National Academy of Sciences to bring together state of the art technical expertise in advanced scientific, engineering and technical disciplines with application to special operation forces.  The standing committee will meet approximately four times annually to identify potential avenues for research and development, product demonstration and practical operational implementation of advanced science and technology.  Committee discussions may form the basis for development and coordination of additional National Research Council (NRC) activities, such as ad hoc studies, workshops or other activities responsive to the USSOCOM mission that draw on the expertise of all applicable units of the National Academies. The Air Force Studies Board, the Naval Studies Board, and the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST), established by the NRC, have been providing this exact capability for the Military Departments with great success for over two decades.  This experience and expertise with DOD agencies uniquely qualifies the NRC to provide this service for USSOCOM.  The period of performance will be one year, with options for two additional years. NAICS code 541990. See Note 22.

The purpose of this Industry Day is to match agency needs with current industry capabilities, provide a forum for technical exchange among potential bidders, and to discover what commercial practices can be successfully introduced to current agency processes.   Through a series of presentations, AAFES will describe its key objectives, a general overview of individual projects, the Public/Private Venture (PPV) process, leasing, finance and the developer selection process.  Presentations will be followed by a brief break and conclude with a question and answer session.

The Post Exchange/Base Exchange (PX/BX) and possibly the Commissary will serve as major anchors to the proposed Lifestyle Centers.  The offerings at these Lifestyle Centers may include a multiplex movie theatre, apparel stores, specialty stores, a food court, casual and family dining, books, and various personal services establishments that are comparable to first class retail establishments outside the gate.  

AAFES will conduct a Developer Forum at our world headquarters on February 15, 2008, wherein each of these projects will be discussed in greater detail.  Attached are the itinerary for this meeting, as well as a map to HQ AAFES Offices.  If you are interested in participating in this forum, please contact the individual shown below so that we may accommodate the appropriate representatives from your company.

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED, VARIABLE SPEED REFUEL DROGUE
<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE  FIRST POSTED ON 20 DECEMBER 2008, DEVELOPMENT OF VARIABLE SPEED, VARIABLE DRAG REFUELING  DROGUE (VSD/VDD).  Reference is made to the pre-solicitation amendment of  14 January 2008 regarding the VSD/VDD Demonstration reference in that  amendment. For the purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight  Certificate is defined as a signed statement from the company based on the  data presented in the safety of flight package and when operated to the  defined limitations their drogue is safe for flight. This is a change to referenced pre-solicitation notice.  Anticipated RFP  release date is changed from 15 January 2008 to ?to be determined (TBD)?.  A firm date will be posted to this site upon a firm date being  established. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is set-aside for small business only.  The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 561612, with a size standard of $17,000,000 average annual gross revenues.

Warranty details, delivery schedule and any other information necessary for the Government to perform a technical evaluation must be submitted.  No further request will be made to obtain required information and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration.  Award will be made relative to overall best value, which will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all requirements, but offers which exceed requirements may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, EvaluationýýýCommercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) capability of the offeror to meet the Government requirement (including schedule); (ii) price; and (iii) past performance.  All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerýýýs specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees.  As a civilian agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, DoDEA operates public schools in 14 districts located in 12 foreign countries, seven states, Guam and Puerto Rico serving 88,000 students.  
The DoDEA Community Strategic Plan (CSP) reflects the agencies commitment to improving student achievement.  Goal 1, ?Highest Student Achievement,? states that all students will meet or exceed challenging standards in academic contents so that they are prepared for continuous learning and productive citizenship.  Thus, DoDEA searches for opportunities that will challenge, enrich and enhance the knowledge base and skill level of our high school students and teachers.  

As part of its mission to challenge its students and enrich their knowledge base, DoDEA has decided that highly capable math and science students need access to summer research opportunities that allow them to experience quality research while working with top educators and/or mentors.  As such, DoDEA seeks such summer programs for select academically advanced high school juniors.

2.0 BACKGROUND

Several years ago, DoDEA recognized that because of the geographical dispersion and limited size of some of its schools, highly capable math and science students were not being challenged academically in ways that fostered continuous learning. As such, DoDEA wanted a few highly capable students to be able to augment their in-class study by participating in a rigorous academic summer program which emphasized advanced theory and research in mathematics and the sciences.  It was important to DoDEA that the summer program be held during DoDEA?s summer break and be residential in nature, so as to accommodate students traveling from all over the world.  Further, DoDEA sought a program with a broad academic reach, which could provide access to multiple topics and resources not otherwise available in their home schools.   

3.0 SCOPE:

3.1  This will be a one year base plus four option years contract. 

3.2 The activities for the DoDEA students participating in the summer   
       science/math/engineering program are as follows:

3.2.1	Receive academic instruction in mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biology in a classroom context and exposure to cutting edge scientific research to a topic of their choice.
3.2.2	Learn the basics of a scientific computing environment and how 
           to use a scientific manuscript preparation tool.
3.2.3	Complete an independent science research project under the supervision of a 
            prominent researcher at a Research University or Research Center.
3.2.4	Engage in scientific manuscript development and presentation skills workshops with the program alumni, students, and staff.
3.2.5   Complete a scientific research paper and presentation under the supervision of 
           experienced educators and scientists.
3.2.6   Participate in lectures and dinners with prominent leaders in the fields of science, 
           mathematics, engineering, business, and government.
3.2.7	Receive coaching and instruction after the summer program to help the student complete a successful entry into a national science competition.
3.2.8	Become a part of an active networking group, through which students receive advice, instruction, and support during their college application process, their undergraduate studies, and graduate school.  Assistance in gaining admission to colleges and universities, in securing scholarships and fellowships, helping secure career related summer employment are examples of the support and networking expected.
3.2.9	Become part of a unique peer group composed of other students with exceptional skill and interest in the fields of mathematics and science research.
3.2.10	Participate in social events with other students and alumni in the academic community.


4.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

4.1 The summer research program will provide the following services for the three  
       DoDEA students:

4.1.1 Instruct/mentor student research in mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry or

This request is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) #Q2623080004 for Proocurement Analyst Support Services for a base contract of six (6) months with 3 option periods of 6 months each. This solicitiation includes the provisions and clauses of the Federal Acquisition Requlations (FAR) in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23, 12/26/07. The FAR is accessible at http://www.arnet.gov/far. This solicitation is set aside for 100% small business. The NAICS code is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 million dollars. STATEMENT OF WORK - PROCUREMENT ANALYST SUPPORT SERVICES  (Internal Controls, Corrective Action Plan Management Support) for the CONTRACTING OFFICE 1. General Information The National Park Service (NPS) is a bureau in the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and is part of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.  The NPS consists of 388 distinct units extending from Guam to Alaska to Puerto Rico, including all the States except Delaware.  The Service is charged with the management of the nation's most precious natural and cultural resources. The contracting and federal financial assistance functions in NPS are decentralized.  They are carried out by approximately 350 Contracting Officers (CO's) and 1500 CO Representatives across seven regions, two national centers, and the majority of the parks.  The CO's obligate approximately $800M per year in contracts for construction, architect-engineer, interpretative media design and fabrication, research, IT, data organization and management, concessions support, and other services and commodities.  The Bureau Procurement Chief (BPC), located in the Contracting Office (WCP), is responsible for Servicewide policy and oversight for these contracting and financial assistance functions.  In 2006, DOI conducted an acquisition management review (AMR) of the NPS contracting and financial assistance programs.   The AMR required NPS develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP).  The Plan impacts the organization, operations, reporting and supervision of its acquisition and financial assistance functions Servicewide.  It also requires:  * creating, documenting, implementing and testing internal controls for these functions that are consistent with OMB Circular A-123 (Revised); and * creating, documenting, implementing and testing a process of AMRs for NPS contracting and financial assistance activities that is consistent with DOI policy, and which validates that internal controls are working.   The CAP is being implemented.  It is comprised of over 100 action items.  Implementation is not expected to be complete until approximately 2011.  At about the same time as the AMR, DOI revised its policy regarding field contracting officers (CO's).  The new policy requires these CO's be under the direct supervision of a major buying organization (MABO).  This policy change also had organizational, operational, reporting and supervision impacts on the Servicewide contracting and federal financial assistance functions, over and above what was required by the CAP.   The contractor's primary responsibility shall be to provide non-personal, senior level procurement analyst support services to the BPC in managing implementation of the CAP; Regional/Center MABO plans; and a system of internal controls for the contracting and financial assistance functions.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

Title:  NVLAP Test Methods and Accreditation Requirements for ITST Lab Security Testing Programs

Background Information

The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) is a voluntary, fee-supported program to accredit laboratories that are found competent to perform specific tests or calibrations, or types of tests or calibrations.  The program was established by NIST in 1976 to serve the needs of the Government and private sector (industry, consumers and other stakeholders) by fostering and promoting a uniformly acceptable base of professionalism and technical competence in the laboratory community, and to facilitate and promote acceptance of calibration and test results between countries to avoid barriers to trade.  The combination of testing and calibration laboratory accreditations by NVLAP provides an infrastructure of competent measurement laboratories supporting domestic and international trade and conformity assessment activities.  The program provides an unbiased third-party evaluation and recognition of performance, as well as expert technical guidance to upgrade laboratory performance.  NVLAP procedures are contained in 15 CFR Part 285.

Currently, NVLAP has Laboratory Accreditation Programs (LAPs) for the following:  Calibration Laboratories, Chemical Calibration, Electromagnetic Compatibility and Telecommunications, Environmental:  Asbestos, Fasteners and Metals, Homeland Security Applications, Information Technology Security Testing, Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry, Product Testing and Voting Systems Testing.

This project concerns Information Technology Security Testing (ITST), both Common Criteria Testing (CCT) and Cryptographic and Security (CST) testing.  The Contractor shall assure that the program specific handbooks and checklists meet current accreditation body requirements.  Finally, the Contractor shall assist NVLAP by providing administrative and management for the two accreditation programs.

Tasks:

The Contractor shall assist NVLAP to incorporate new scopes of accreditation for SCAP Validation program into ITST to provide the support necessary to maintain it at the required level of quality and transparency required by NVLAP participation.  

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

?	Publicize NVLAP accreditation offering
?	Train in-site assessors
?	Expand program offering to all ITST labs

The Contractor shall revise the program specific handbook and assessment checklist for CST to conform to current quality system standards, Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) standards, NVLAP standards, and other pertinent recommendations.

The Contractor shall ensure that all on-site assessments and other NVLAP processes are up to date for 2008.  There are 10 accredited CCT laboratories and 15 CST laboratories with 5 more coming on-board.  The on-site assessment is a 2-year process in which NVLAP program manager:

?	Selects expert assessor from pool of assessors for each upcoming (every 2 years) on-site assessment
?	Monitors scheduling of assessment as performed by assessor, and pending or unresolved issues from laboratory?s last on-site assessment
?	Reviews on-site assessment reports by assessors as soon as they are received by NVLAP
?	Monitors laboratory?s action plan and/or corrective action for addressing any non-conformities found as result of on-site assessment
?	Assures that all non-conformities are remedied before accreditation is renewed.

The Contractor shall examine the records of all CCT and CST laboratories and assure that NVLAP has their action plans, if corrective action has not been reported; determine that assessor has seen and approved corrective actions; provide review for all on-site assessment reports received; communicate with and submit to the NIST COTR for review expert assessors for upcoming assessments; and, monitor that scheduled assessments meet deadline requirements.  How to meet these requirements and deadlines for CCT LAP will be reviewed with the NIST Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) before commencement of this phase of the project.

Deliverables:

1.	Design and field test proficiency exams and other requirements for SCAP
2.	Incorporate SCAP test suite in new Handbook 150-17
3.	Conduct workshop for SCAP laboratories, assessors and vendors
4.	Conduct training for expert and quality system assessors and laboratories in common criteria
5.	Conduct workshops for laboratories, ITL experts and assessors in cryptographic and security testing
6.	Process P25 handbook through review process, including WERB and OBM clearance for Paperwork Reduction Act
7.	Assist with program management for development of Biometrics LAP.  Conduct workshop for technical experts to identify the test requirements and test methods
8.	Manage IT Security Testing LAP, including identifying more expert assessors and candidates for ITST management

All the above deliverables shall be prepared for NIST COTR review and acceptance.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

The NIST COTR, as a duly authorized representative of the Contracting Officer, shall assume the responsibilities for monitoring the Contractor?s performance, evaluating the quality of services provided by the Contractor and performing final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables.

Period of Performance:

The period of performance shall be one year from effective date of award.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561990. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a contractor to support the Clinical Center Patient representative. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. 

?Professional Services Contract Statement of Work?

The contractor will serve as assistant to the Clinical Center Patient Representative (PR). He/ she will be responsible for contacting patients and family members as assigned, who are seeking assistance from the PR office. He/ she will work closely with the PR to insure a seamless response to expressed concerns and a coordinated approach to hospital staff, administrators, Institute staff and others needed to resolve the problems. He/ she will investigate patient/ family complaints and develop a plan of action in concert with the PR. Effective communication with staff at all levels of the organization ? administrators, clinical research staff, and Institute staff ? as well as clinicians and many others outside the hospital will make successful resolution possible.

The contractor, working with the PR, will be involved in the continued development of systematic data management that maintains the confidentiality of patients, while meeting the needs of the organization in a more comprehensive, consistent, and apparent manner.  

The contractor will help the PR to develop a systematic pro-active approach to patients and families in the outpatient clinics. Currently, inpatients are contacted routinely and made aware of the PR program, and there are numerous professional staff available to them on the patient-care unit. The outpatients are not given this same support. Their contact with staff is considerably less and often they are faced with complex problems to handle on their own. 

The contractor will contact patients and families, assigned by the PR, in follow-up to determine the outcome of intervention by the PR office. He/ she will be responsible for helping the PR to develop a system for responding to whatever needs remain unmet and maintaining contact with the individual(s) until a more complete resolution of the problem or concern occurs. 

With the increase in requests to the PR office for consent-monitoring, the contractor will work with clinical research teams as assigned, and provide consent-monitoring when appropriate from a patient-advocacy point of view. Together, the PR and the contractor will determine the most appropriate situations for providing this service. Communication about these cases with both the Clinical Bioethics Department and the NIMH Psychiatric Consult Service will continue in an ongoing way to provide the optimal service to patients and families.

The contractor will help the PR to evaluate the PR volunteer program and to assess its changing needs and focus. He/ she will help to re-direct and re-train current volunteers as appropriate and necessary.

Working closely with the PR, the contractor will review very complex cases, will help to determine the best approach to handle them and will participate in evaluation of the outcome. 

Using professional skills and experience, the contractor will work with the PR to identify areas within the NIH clinical research program for enhancing patient advocacy. Both will work together to describe this model of patient advocacy within a clinical research setting with presentations in appropriate settings and in written materials to be submitted for publication in professional journals.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) seek interested parties to become partners in the Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation, CORANET III (herein referred to as CORANET) to actively participate in scheduled workshops, meetings, and short-term collaborative projects, for the purpose of arriving at scientific and technical solutions to improving the efficiency of the combat ration industry and its manufacturing supply chain.. In FY 2006 the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia sold $3.9B in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense, making it DSCP?s largest supply chain.  Sales in subsistence continue to grow, largely due to requirements for operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.  The Combat Rations Network (CORANET) is a DOD Manufacturing Technology Program for technology implementation sponsored by the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia.  CORANET was established in 1996 to develop and introduce modern manufacturing processes into the U.S. industrial base to assure timely availability of affordable, high quality, high variety combat rations to the warfighters.  The scope of the CORANET program includes all of the manufacturing technologies related to the production, storage and distribution of combat rations.  These rations include individual rations such as Meals, Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as unitized group rations.   The goal of the CORANET program is to fulfill DSCP?s mission by improving the efficiency of the combat ration industry and its manufacturing supply chain.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $2 million per year for 7 years is planned during Fiscal Years 2009-2015.  This investment shall be for funding of Partner contracts and short-term projects (STPs).  Interested parties can visit the CORANET website at www.coranet2.org  to obtain more information about the current program.
2.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION 

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) hard copies of full proposals (as well as an electronic file) and refer to BAA# 02-0008 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on March 5, 2008, in DSCP-Business Opportunities Office, Bldg 36, 2nd floor, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111 in order to be considered. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA.  DSCP encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions to submit proposals under this BAA.  However, no portion of this BAA shall be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail or fax is preferred. Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded. 

3.  PROGRAM INFORMATION

CORANET is a ?community of practice? engaging academic and industrial research partners with the diverse collection of government agencies and programs that oversee and administer the development, production and distribution of military rations.
All of the participants meet at regularly scheduled workshops.  They work collaboratively to identify problems and needed improvements and to define solutions.  Research solutions are demonstrated and implemented through short term projects conducted by a collaboration of academic and industry partners and overseen by the appropriate government representatives.  

CORANET STRUCTURE
The CORANET program is made up of CORANET Partners who engage in short term research projects (STPs) under the oversight of the Joint Steering Group (JSG).  Project development and review is performed at CORANET Workshops.

PARTNERS
DSCP contemplates awarding multiple partner contracts.  The period of performance of the partner contract is expected to be 7 years with a 2-year base period and five 1-year option periods.  New partners chosen to participate are eligible to receive an estimated amount of up to $20,000 per calendar year for authorized travel and related costs to attend and actively participate in CORANET workshops and other Government sponsored meetings.  Selected partners shall have the option to receive or decline Partner funding, however all partners shall be required to attend CORANET sponsored meeting regardless of funding levels.  Registration fees for CORANET workshop attendance are waived for the first two partners attending from each organization.  Each partner is required to bring specific technical expertise that lends itself to significant improvements of the combat ration industry?s ability to meet DLA combat ration needs.  The potential technical areas of expertise include, but are not limited to four principal areas: (1)Food science and technologies, including food chemistry, food microbiology, new product development , sensory and quality evaluation, process unit operation and GMP; (2) Material science and engineering including polymer science and engineering, material joining technologies, mechanical properties, permeabilities; (3) Sensors and database management including: inspection methods, on-line sensors, data interchange and database, asset visibility and tracking; (4) Operations including: production control, process flow and efficiency, supply chain interaction and management, 	computer aided design and operation, process automation.  The focus of CORANET is for all partners to actively and continuously assist DLA in improving its ability to meet/exceed a varying range of military requirements through research, development and technology transfer efforts as they apply to the combat ration and related industries.

JOINT STEERING GROUP
The JSG oversees all CORANET activities.  It is made up of government representatives from the Military Services, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Defense Logistics Agency, USDA, VETCOM, and the Natick Soldier Systems Center.

WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS
The CORANET Partners and the JSG meet three times a year at workshops to review ongoing projects, identify new areas for CORANET investment, review proposed projects, review CORANET procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA/DSCP and Service combat rations needs and requirements.  Additional CORANET meetings may be scheduled as needed.

SHORT TERM PROJECTS
CORANET research is done through the award of short short-term projects that develop and adapt modern manufacturing processes to be implemented within the industrial base to assure the prompt and sustained availability, variety, quality and affordability of combat rations.  Short term projects have an expected duration of 12-24 months and an average funding level of $100-150K per year.  All STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as ROI where applicable.  To assure that 1) All CORANET STPs are fully documented; 2) All projects have the potential for implementation in industry; 3) That all projects address a specific DLA/DSCP/DOD need, a typical CORANET project shall have an academic partner, industrial partner and government sponsor.  It is anticipated that projects will be awarded semi-annually in October and March.

Award will be made relative to overall best value, which will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all requirements, but offers which exceed requirements may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) Delivery Schedule (iii) price; and (iv) past performance.  All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerýýýs specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
