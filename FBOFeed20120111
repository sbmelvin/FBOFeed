<p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate intends to issue a solicitation for the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) Development Contract not before 15 days after the posting of this Notice of Proposed Contract Action. For this acquisition, the NAICS code is 517919, and widest industry participation is encouraged to include that of qualified small and small disadvantaged businesses. <br />The EPS program will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF) protected satellite communications (SATCOM) capability to forces operating in the North Polar Region. The system will provide communications for the National Command Authority (NCA), military tactical and strategic forces and other user communities. EPS will provide the capability to carry secure teletype, voice, email, instant messaging, video, multi-media and data communications. EPS will provide continuous coverage to terminals operating in the polar region and support secure, jam-resistant, strategic and tactical communications between forces operating above 65 degrees north latitude (defined as the Polar Field of View or PFOV) and mid-latitude users. EPS consists of the following segments:<br />&bull; EPS Payload Segment<br />&bull; EPS Terminal Segment<br />&bull; EPS Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) <br />&bull; EPS Gateway Segment</p>
<p>EPS Program Office will be responsible for overall development, performance and integration of the system, to include overall system level SEIT. This solicitation solely concerns CAPS, associated CAPS SEIT tasks and support to the overall system level SEIT activities conducted by the EPS Program Office. CAPS will be used in conjunction with the Telemetry and Control (T&amp;C) terminal provided by the Terminal Segment. The T&amp;C terminal will provide connectivity between the payload and CAPS. CAPS will provide: <br />&bull; EPS planning and management<br />&bull; In-band EPS payload system control<br />&bull; EPS cryptographic planning<br />&bull; EPS terminal image generation</p>
<p>CAPS is the primary means for commanding and receiving telemetry for the payloads. CAPS provides execution of essential mission functions such as payload clock management and over-the-air-rekey (OTAR) of user terminals. CAPS will receive spacecraft ephemeris data from the Host Mission Ground Station and use it to generate User Ephemeris Messages that are uplinked to the EPS payload for distribution to the Terminal Segment. Currently, CAPS is planned to be deployed at Schriever AFB with the T&amp;C terminal located at the EPS Gateway site.<br />CAPS is part of an urgently needed EPS capability to ensure there is no gap in critical polar communications. As a result, the Government seeks an offering that has high confidence in meeting the schedule outlined in the solicitation.<br />The CAPS contract type will be a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract and the Period of Performance (PoP) for the overall contract will be from Milestone-B (MS-B) to Initial Operational Capability (IOC). The basic contract includes the design work and non-recurring engineering for a unique system, as well as CAPS related SEIT and support to EPS system level SEIT. Additionally, a CPIF priced option to complete the development and deployment of CAPS and for CAPS related SEIT support to EPS is included. <br />The desired outcome of this contract effort is a fully operational system that meets the threshold requirements defined in the segment specifications and meets the government operational needs as tested and accepted by the Responsible Test Organization (RTO).<br />On the date of the final RFP release to Industry, the Government will post an announcement on FedBizOps, and post the final RFP documents to the EPS CAPS Bidder's Library. Draft versions of the RFP documents are currently available in the Bidder's Library. Interested contractors should ensure they have access to the Bidder's Library prior to RFP release. Contractors may request access to the Bidder's Library by contacting Ms. LaMia Keenan by email at lamia.keenan.ctr@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-9393 (Alternate POC: Mr. Noble Smith, noble.smith@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-9294) and must obtain and sign a Non-disclosure Agreement prior to being granted access to the Bidder's Library. All information in the Bidder's Library is at the unclassified level. For access to classified information related to this effort, please see the instructions in the RFP. <br />This notice is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. <br />Any and all EPS-related program questions should be addressed to the EPS Contracting Officer, Ms. Natalie Tunnell, Email: Natalie.Tunnell@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command, National Capital Region intends to award a 12-month Cost Plus Fixed-Fee type contract with one 12-month option period on a non-competitive basis to Harris Corporation of Melbourne, FL under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, for the procurement of ongoing sustainment and support services for the AN/GSC-52 Modernization (52 Mod) Program's family of Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Earth Terminals (AN/GSC-52A(V), AN/GSC-39C and D, AN/FSC-78C(V) and AN/TSC-86A, C, D, E and F) and associated equipment.  The contract will include systems engineering, integration efforts, system testing, documentation, and depot maintenance support.  The 52 Mod Program's family of SATCOM Earth Terminals are part of the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global System (WGS), which provide global wideband satellite communications for the DoD and other US Government agencies.  These Earth Terminals provide highly reliable communications and interfaces with compatible Super High Frequency (SHF) terminals connecting to the DSCS/WGS constellation.  The AN/GSC-52 Family of Modernized SATCOM Earth Terminals also provides pre-positioned Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) services for tactical users, as well as strategic communications support at fixed locations.  This allows for the extension of DISN services such as secure and non-secure voice, video, and data capabilities to the deployed Soldiers.<br><br>The contractor shall provide engineering, software and logistics support and services to ensure successful sustainment of the 52 Mod Program's family of SATCOM Earth Terminals and affiliated subsystems during the sustainment phase of the AN/GSC-52 Modernization Program.  The contractor shall provide logistics management support, logistics analyses, changes and updates to engineering and technical documentation, including Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and Repair Parts and Special Tools Lists (RPSTL), engineering services, telephonic and on-site technical assistance, sustainment training, painting, and corrosion control services.<br><br>The contractor shall continue developing the required Replacement Radio Frequency Interconnecting Subsystem (RRFIS) tuning procedures inherently tied to the functions and capabilities of the 52 Mod equipment.  Successful sustainment, inclusive of implementation and enhancement of RRFIS, depends upon detailed technical knowledge of the existing RRFIS design and access to drawings and software code being written by the contractor which is unique to RRFIS production models.  Another contractor would not be capable of meeting the established MILCON and satellite launch schedules and maintaining the associated software. <br><br>The contractor shall continue modification of the modem components, developed by the contractor as part of the Anti-Scintillation Modem, and integrate the upgraded modem components as part of the Protected Anti-Jam Anti-Scintillation Wideband Net-Centric Modem (PAAWNS).  This will provide additional capabilities when integrated with the High-altitude Electro-Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) protected AN/GSC-52 terminals to satisfy the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requirements for protected satellite communications in perturbed environments.<br><br>Harris Corporation is the only known source with the specialized experience, skills, operational familiarity, and Technical Data Package needed to perform the required services.  The AN/GSC-52 SATCOM Earth Terminals were modernized with a common suite of electronics components and subsystems through the AN/GSC-52 Modernization Program.  Harris produced the modernized AN/GSC-52A(V) SATCOM terminals.<br><br>The NACIS code for this procurement is 811213 with the corresponding small business size standard of $10 million.  The estimated award date is 26 March 2012.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Questions may be addressed to Jennifer Johnson, Contracting Officer (e-mail jennifer.d.johnson1.civ@mail.mil) or Edie Reisberg, Contract Specialist (e-mail eda.m.reisberg.civ@mail.mil) or Giorgiana Chen, Contract Specialist (e-mail giorgiana.chen.civ@mail.mil). <br>

Any interested parties must  train the necessary work force to meet the Government's needs for non-personal IACS Registrars to take up positions and to begin at all 23 sites located in Germany, Belgium and Italy on 10 February 2012, without an unacceptable degradation of essential support operations.  A lapse in contractor qualified IACS Registrars Services would put U.S. troops and support personnel at risk, and jeopardize the successful completion of their mission.     <br>The requirements for the follow-on contract have just recently changed from the previous award. These changes are the driver for the extension. Contractors will be required to develop training modules, i.e. a web based training program, for System Managers, Law Enforcement Officials and IACS Sponsors. This web based training will incorporate the use of graphics, animation, audio, and video to support the learning objectives. In addition, the PWS calls for Training updates in the option years and a Training Monitor.  <br>A competition is underway for a follow-on contract with an estimated award date in the 3nd Quarter of FY 2012. The Government estimates that allowing for full and open competition for the proposed contract would take 4-5 months.  The Government estimates the contractor will need a 2 month mobilization period.  Among the challenges for a new contractor to mobilize include recruiting Registrars who must be U.S. citizens and must also have completed background checks prior to commencing work on the contract. In addition, any local nationals hired to perform on this contract must also pass a security check.  <br><br>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. NOTE:  This is only a 4-month action. A competitive action is in process.  NAICIS Code:  518210<br>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE)), anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about January 30, 2012. It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101.
<p>OVAE intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action for a requirement of services to establish a National Research Center for Career and Technical Education (NRCCTE or Center), which will conduct research, disseminate findings, establish professional development, and training activities. This requirement is congressionally-mandated through the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV). <strong>This requirement will be limited, as statute requires, to any private or public nonprofit, education institution, or consortium of such institutions.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Historically, the national research center evolved out of the Vocational Education Act of 1963. This Act was the first to provide federal funding for research in vocational education. However, it was not until the passage of the Education Amendments of 1976 that the first research center was authorized and was reauthorized by the subsequent Carl D. Perkins Acts of 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2006. Perkins IV authorizes the funding of one center to conduct research, dissemination, professional development and training activities.</p>
<p>The NRCCTE carries out the four requirements in section 114(d) (4) of the Act. In addition, pursuant to section 114(d) (5) of the Act, the NRCCTE carries out technical assistance upon request of states on effective methods and techniques for providing career and technical education (CTE) programs. The NRCCTE research studies have focused on, among other topics, programs of study (POS); curriculum integration (math, science, literacy); postsecondary student engagement, achievement, and transition; and professional development for CTE educators. Information about the NRCCTE studies, including reports and findings from the current and previous research centers, can be found at www.nrccte.org.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The Center shall meet the following statutory requirements in section 114(d) (4) of the Act:<br />(a) Carry out scientifically based research and evaluation for the purpose of developing, improving, and identifying the most successful methods for addressing the education, employment, and training needs of participants.<br />(b) Carry out scientifically based research and evaluation to increase the effectiveness and improve the implementation of career and technical education programs that are integrated with coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards.<br />(c) Carry out scientifically based research and evaluation that can be used to improve the preparation and professional development of teachers, faculty, counselors, and administrators.<br />(d) Conduct dissemination and training activities based upon the Center's research.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be thirty six (36) months from the effective date of this contract.</p>

<SUBJECT>99--Future Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) In Development Activities - Request for Cost Estimates
<SOLNBR>11420
<RESPDATE>012712
<ARCHDATE>02112012
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This purpose of this market survey is obtain industry input to assist the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS)Program Office in estimating costs for future ADS-B-In development activities. The specific goal is to obtain cost estimates for supplying aircraft avionics to participate in future Operational Evaluations of ADS-B-In applications as described below.  This market survey is not for the purposes of a planned FAA acquisition.
Per the recommendations of the ADS-B-In Aviation Rulemaking Commmittee (ARC) (see , FAA is considering the development of multiple ADS-B-In applications. The ARC recommended that the FAA use operational evaluations to mature equipment standards and regulatory guidance, as well as demonstrate the operational benefits of these applications in the National Airspace System (NAS).
The FAA SBS office is preparing budget and schedule estimates for potential programmatic activities in the FY2014 to FY2020 timeframe. These estimates will be used to frame internal FAA budget and programmatic decisions.     
For the purposes of responding to this market survey, an Operational Evaluation is defined as "an evaluation involving a certified-for-intended-function system built to a defined standard (either a MOPS or a draft MOPS), for which use of the system has been granted Operational Approval by FAA Flight Standards, and where said approved system is used in daily NAS operations for a period of 6-12 months."
In response to the ADS-B-In ARC recommendations, the FAA is considering the following Operational Evaluations (OpEvals):1.	A "domestic" Interval Management OpEval beginning before the end of FY2015 in the airspace around one or more US airports. This OpEval would involve an end-to-end evaluation of the Ground Interval Management - Spacing (GIM-S) capability currently under development by the FAA, with aircraft having at least a FIM-S capability as defined in recommendation 8, subpart 2 of the ADS-B-In ARC report. In addition, aircraft will be equipped to perform CEDS per recommendation 8, subpart 5 of the ADS-B-In ARC report, but limited to along-track target aircraft. For additional information, see below text on Additional Information and Assumptions.2.	An "oceanic" Interval Management OpEval beginning before the end of FY2016 in the Oakland Oceanic FIR. This OpEval would involve an end-to-end evaluation of FAA oceanic ATC automation with aircraft having at least an avionics capability to support the ADS-B-In application defined in recommendation 8, subpart 9 of the ADS-B-In ARC report. For additional information, see below text on Additional Information and Assumptions.3.	A "domestic" Interval Management OpEval beginning in the FY2018-2020 timeframe in the airspace around one or more US airports. This OpEval would involve an end-to-end evaluation of a GIM capability that would include TRACON metering and scheduling, with aircraft having at least a FIM-DI capability as defined in recommendation 8, subpart 7 of the ADS-B-In ARC report. In addition, aircraft will be equipped to perform FIM-DI CSPO per recommendation 8, subpart 8 of the ADS-B-In ARC report, as modified by a follow-on ARC response contained in Attachment 1 hereto (i.e., limited to dependent parallel target aircraft). For additional information, see below text on Additional Information and Assumptions.4.	A SURF-IA OpEval beginning in the FY2018-2020 timeframe at multiple US airports. See recommendation 8, subpart 7 of the ADS-B-In ARC report. For additional information, see below text on Additional Information and Assumptions.
This market survey and associated information does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to execute the described OpEvals.  
The following additional information relating to the above OpEvals is provided. 1.	OpEvals 1, 3, and 4 all require aircraft which perform multiple flights (takeoffs and landings) in a single day. Target aircraft for these OpEvals are expected to be regional jets, and/or business jets, and/or single-aisle aircraft produced by Airbus and Boeing.2.	OpEvals 1 and 3 must be performed in airspace where FAA will have the requisite ATC automation in place (TBFM/ERAM/STARS) to support Interval Management operations.3.	OpEval 2 requires aircraft which fly frequently in the Oakland Oceanic FIR, and in areas within this FIR where traffic is sufficiently dense to exercise the ADS-B-In application. Currently, the Pacific Organized Track System (PACOTS) and the track system between the US mainland and Hawaii within the Central East Pacific (CEP) region are the candidate areas. Target aircraft for this OpEval are expected to be wide-body aircraft produced by Airbus and Boeing, and/or long-range business jets.4.	OpEval 4 requires sites with the requisite airport layout complexity, traffic density, and Line-of-Sight issues to exercise the ADS-B-In application.5.	FAA believes that there is potential synergy between OpEvals 3 and 4 for both technical and operational reasons, and encourages responses that consider such a combination.
An integrated display installation (traffic display in the primary field-of-view) is highly desirable for these OpEvals, as such installations support the long-term FAA strategy for ADS-B-In. Vendors are encouraged to provide cost estimates (as described below) for such installations.
However, some airlines have expressed interest in "auxiliary display" installations that are cheaper to retrofit on some aircraft. FAA notes that several of the applications recommended by the ADS-B-In ARC are to be used in critical phases of flight, and are therefore expected to have requirements for control and display of critical information in the "primary field-of-view" as described in FAA certification guidance material. Vendor responses which provide cost estimates for "auxiliary display" installations should consider how "primary field-of-view" information requirements will be met and their potential costs.
Vendors are to use the following assumptions for use in responding to this market survey:1.	All OpEvals will require the ability to capture and record aircraft/transponder data for post-flight analysis. 2.	Vendors shall assume that FAA will record data from ATC automation and that FAA will arrange for a 3rd-party to correlate this data with aircraft-recorded data for analysis purposes. Vendors shall also assume that FAA will insure that such a 3rd-party arrangement provides for appropriate "de-identification" per the various pilot and controller union agreements.3.	Vendors shall assume that the avionics standards needed for OpEval 1 will be included in RTCA DO-317B and that DO-317B will be finalized by the end of FY2013.4.	Vendors shall assume that the avionics standards needed for OpEvals 2, 3 and 4 will be included in RTCA DO-317C and that DO-317C will be finalized by the end of FY2015.5.	Vendor responses shall assume that aircraft operators participating in these OpEvals will be "fleet operators" with in-place capabilities to install equipment per manufacturer instructions and adequately train flight crews in use of the ADS-B-In system application. However, vendors shall account for providing the necessary technical materials to operators to enable them to install the equipment and train their flight crews.6.	Vendor responses shall assume that avionics development activities for the subject ADS-B-In application system can begin as early as one quarter year prior to MOPS completion (beginning of 4Q FY13 for DO-317B and beginning of 4Q FY15 for DO-317C).7.	Vendors shall assume that all ADS-B-In avionics are compatible with other aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that comply with 14 CFR 91.225 and 14 CFR 91.227.8.	Vendors may assume that ADS-B-In avionics are capable of receiving and processing ADS-B broadcasts using the DO-260 and DO-260A standards, per FAA regulatory guidance.9.	For OpEvals 1, 3, and 4, vendors shall assume that a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 100 aircraft are to be equipped/provisioned to participate in the OpEval.10.	For OpEval 2, vendors shall assume that a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 30 aircraft are to be equipped/provisioned to participate in the OpEval.
It is requested that vendors submit the following information in response to this market survey:A.	Development and certification Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs, by year, of the ADS-B-In application that will be used in the OpEval. These estimates shall include all development and certification costs that the vendor would expect to incur up to delivery of the first certified unit.B.	ROM costs (exclusive of NRE), by year, for the vendor to supply any needed equipment and/or software license fees to "equip" each aircraft for the OpEval (new or modified hardware units, software updates, etc). Vendor responses should includes cost estimates for both the minimum and maximum numbers described in Assumptions 18 and 19. Also, supporting narrative describing the cost variability between the minimum and maximum numbers is requested; at a minimum, this shall include vendor commentary on the linearity of cost with number of aircraft equipped.C.	Vendor cost estimates need not include aircraft downtime, aircraft installation labor, or pilot training. If such estimates are provided, they must be clearly broken out.D.	Vendor ROM cost estimates shall be expressed to the nearest integer $M. More precise ROM cost estimates are acceptable, but not required.E.	A narrative describing how the Vendor would expect to proceed from MOPS to certified avionics for the OpEval. Generic descriptions are acceptable, but any special considerations should be described.F.	Vendor narrative commentary on the proposed schedule from MOPS to OpEval is solicited, but not required.G.	Any additional key assumptions made by the Vendor in arriving at the ROM cost estimates in A or B.H.	Vendors may respond for one, some or all of the OpEvals described herein.I.	Vendors may also provide other commentary with their submissions as they deem appropriate and informative to the FAA.J.	Vendor responses should address technical means for recording aircraft/transponder data on each aircraft participating in the OpEval, as well as means for retrieving this data from the OpEval aircraft on a daily or weekly basis without impacting the efficiency of flight operations.
All submitted ROM cost estimates shall be provided according to the US Government fiscal year, which begins 1-Oct and ends 30-Sep. For example, FY12 began on 1-Oct-2011 and ends on 30-Sep-2012.
All vendor responses will be treated as Proprietary and Confidential if appropriately marked.
This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
It is requested that vendor responses be submitted to Stephen B. Manley at Steve.Manley@faa.gov.by February 3, 2012.

 ATTACHMENT 1 - Follow-on information from the ADS-B-In ARC regarding ARC recommendation 8, subpart 8

ARC RECOMMENDATION 10The ARC recommends its continued efforts to further define Flight-deck-based Interval Management (FIM-DI) for Closely Spaced Parallel Runway Operations (CSPO).

FAA INITIAL RESPONSE TO ARC RECOMMENDATION 10SBS Program to ask ARC for more definition regarding what efforts the ARC recommends that it conduct to further define FIM-DI for CSPO. FAA also will request clarity on why ARC chose to define this application in this way, versus a variant of the Paired Approach application in the AIWPv2.

ARC CLARIFICATION TO FAA, PROVIDED 22-DEC-2011Needed by 2017:  	FIM-DI to support simultaneous approaches (previously categorized as dependent parallel approaches) and paired approaches with angled-in final approach segment.
After 2017:	Paired approach using Simplified Aircraft Based Parallel Approach (SAPA).
Note 1: In its end state we expect FIM-DI to account for wake vortex mitigation, however we don't believe this capability is achievable by 2017.
Note 2: It is important that any pilot tools for precise position keeping, be it FIM-DI or CSPO be very similar with only "nuance" differences. That is why these were lumped together. A CSPO pilot tool that is totally different from that used for FIM-S or FIM-DI will require lots of additional training, and will become a "one off" tool, just as PRM became. The reason we grouped these the way we did was to preclude any more "one off" solutions. FIM-S should look like FIM-DI, which should look like CSPO (or Paired Approach)(with only nuance differences that would require minimal additional pilot training).

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT                      for Obstacle Data Processing
INTRODUCTION 
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.2.1. This is not a solicitation announcement. This announcement is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award. Since this is a market survey announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
The FAA has a requirement to investigate the technology and contractor capability available to help with efforts to resolve missing or poor obstacle accuracy codes for data on man-made vertical objects (e.g., communication towers, wind turbines, transmission towers, buildings) needed for instrument flight procedure development, airspace sector design - Minimum Instrument Flight Rules Altitude / Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MIA/MVA) and any other application that needs verified obstacle information.The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and descriptions of technologies, methodologies, and systems available from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the services described in the Problem Statement and Requirements sections below. Responses to this Market Survey are intended to improve the FAA's understanding of the current marketplace, obtain information on available technology and innovative approaches that may solve the problems and fulfill the requirements described below, and gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices. This Market Survey seeks industry input to identify the best technical approach for resolving missing or poor obstacle accuracy codes for data on man-made vertical objects.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Area Navigation (RNAV)/Required Navigation Performance (RNP) operations require more accurate obstacle data than what may be currently available in the FAA obstacle database. The Terrain and Obstacle Data Team (TOD-T) is responsible for the collection, analysis, validation, maintenance, and publication/distribution of both "under construction" and "as-built' obstacles" in the National Airspace System (NAS).   The TOD-T Obstacle Repository System (ORS) contains unverified data that are missing the accuracy codes that indicate the level of accuracy of the obstacle measurement.  In addition, some verified data in the ORS have accuracy codes that indicate that the obstacle was measured to a lower level of accuracy than is now needed.Currently there are a maximum of 42,000 unverified obstacles and a maximum of 111,000 obstacles that lack an adequate accuracy level. These numbers are based on the assumption that there are approximately 300 unverifed or inadequately accurate obstacles per airport, with the potential of 5500 airports involved.The FAA's goal is to have a set of data of verified, as-built obstacles with as high an accuracy level as possible.  
REQUIREMENTS The FAA seeks to obtain information about the current industry technologies, methodologies, and systems available to fulfill the following requirements:
1. For obstacle measurements required of instrument flight procedures, at a minimum, the following accuracy codes shall be provided:    A. within 20,000 feet of a runway, Accuracy Code 1A (see Appendix A)     B. within 10 nautical miles (nm) of the Airport Reference Point (ARP Accuracy Code 1B or better) (see Appendix A).
2. For Minimum Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Altitudes (MIA) / Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) or other applications, at a minimum, an Accuracy Code of 2C or better shall be provided.
Please provide responses to the following questions: 
1. What specific technologies, methodologies, and systems do you have to perform as-built survey measurements of vertical objects?2. What level of accuracy can you achieve with each of the technologies, methodologies, and systems described?3. Is your technology, methodology, or system accepted by other Federal agencies?	INSTRUCTIONS
At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, depending on the results of this Market Survey. 
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement and any costs associated with the market survey submittal is solely at the interested vendor's expense. Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities. Responses will not be returned. This is not a request for proposals or a screening information request of any kind and will not result in a contract award. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code has not yet been determined.
Since this is only a market survey announcement, no solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is issued, it will be published on the FAA's contract opportunities web page: https://faaco.faa.gov".

                                  APPENDIX A:                            BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
In the past, aircraft have been required to fly routes between ground-based navigational aids to maintain required navigation accuracy of on-board systems. The FAA is developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) to move today's ground-based air traffic control system to a more efficient one that relies on on-board satellite-based navigation systems, allowing aircraft to navigate with greater precision and accuracy. New routes and procedures, commonly referred to as Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP), are a corner stone of the NextGen. For RNAV, pilots can use a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and other self-contained systems on-board aircraft to fly any desired flight path by reducing the limitations imposed by ground-based navigation systems. RNP is a form of RNAV that adds monitoring and alerting capabilities to the cockpit to alert the pilot when the aircraft cannot meet specified navigation performance requirements. RNAV and RNP can increase airspace efficiency by providing more direct paths, thereby improving airport arrival rates, enhancing controller productivity, saving fuel, and reducing aircraft noise. 
Accuracy codes associated with surveyed data are defined in FAA Order 8260.19 by the following tables:

HORIZONTAL                                                       	Code 	Tolerance 					1 	+20 ft 	    (6 m) 				2 	+50 ft 	    (15 m) 				3 	+100 ft     (30 m) 				4 	+250 ft     (75 m) 				5 	+500 ft     (150 m) 				6 	+1,000 ft   (300 m) 				7 	+1/2 NM     (900 m) 				8 	+1 NM       (1800 m) 				9 	Unknown

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has re-established a Qualified Vendors List (QVL) that is used for multiple FAA procurements for the manufacturing of modification kits.  These modification kits are primarily used in navigational aids, communications, radar, weather, and environmental areas in support of the National Airspace System (NAS) equipment to improve the safety and systems/equipment reliability and supportability.
This QVL will be maintained for a period of ten (10) years from issuance, with the FAA conducting a review of each vendor's performance at least every two (2) years during the performance period.
A Screening Information Request was posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities web site on August 5, 2011, requesting that technical proposals be submitted by qualified vendors.  This requirement was 100% set-aside for small businesses with a manufacturing facility located within a 150-mile radius of the MMAC (6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK) at time of the submittal.
Four submittals were received.  A technical evaluation was performed on the submittals received.
All four vendors were determined to be technically qualified to be included on the Mod Kit QVL.  The 2012 Mod Kit QVL vendors for the FAA Aeronautical Center are:
ARDCO, Norman, OKBaron Manufacturing, Inc., Oklahoma City, OKJGB Technology, Inc., Oklahoma City, OKSurface Mount Depot, Oklahoma City, OK

<DESC><THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY    Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This announcement constitutes a request for information (RFI). 

The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office is seeking to collaborate with industry to better understand capabilities and recommend solutions for contractor performance of professional and technical support services. 

The Government would like to understand options for how to best structure an Agency-wide program and what mechanisms are commercially available to address a variety of technical and professional support service needs.  The goals of this initiative are to: a) Secure an agency-wide contract vehicle, b) Reduce direct costs of services, c) Reduce the number of professional and technical services contracts within the DOC and bureaus listed below, and d) Reduce administrative overhead required to support these contracts.

While unable to fully define requirements at this time, the Government is requesting industry examine the organizational mission and objectives of the U.S Department of Commerce (www.doc.gov), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov), U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (www.uspto.gov), U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov), and National Telecommunications and Information Agency (http://ntia.doc.gov/) in order to provide comments and recommendations in response to this RFI. 

Specifically, comments and recommendations are requested around the following questions:

I.	Company Background
a.	What professional and technical support services does your company provide?
b.	What geographic locations within the 48 contiguous U.S. can you support with these services?
c.	What is the size and scale of your organization in terms of number of professional and technical support service staff you can provide and by location?
II.	Services Strategy
a.	What is the ideal acquisition strategy for acquiring professional and technical support services that cuts across multiple Agency bureaus such as those identified in Department of Commerce?
b.	How should the management of this initiative be set up?
c.	What is the ideal structure for effectively managing this program post-implementation in a cost-effective manner?
d.	What are levers that can help reduce services costs?
e.	What are potential contract vehicles?
f.	What is the best way to define job categories in a future RFP?
g.	How best should the Government segment skill-sets across categories of services (i.e., Junior vs Senior)?
h.	What are best practices used by other government agencies or commercial firms around professional services sourcing?
i.	What role can small businesses play?

The vendor's response to this RFI should reflect an understanding of NOAA's requirements for service delivery related to the NOAA mission and an overall approach for how to provide the needed capabilities.  
 
The Government anticipates establishing a contract vehicle during the fiscal year 2012, which will be mandatory for NOAA users and optional for all other DOC users.  An Intra-agency Acquisition Team (the Team) has been formed within the Department of Commerce.  This RFI is intended to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Team. The Team is in the process of preparing a draft Statement of Need (SON) which will be posted, after receipt of comments/recommendations, as a future attachment to this notice. The Team welcomes industry comments and recommendations that will aid it in developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the SON.  The Team may conduct one-on-one communications with interested vendors in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI. 

All responsible sources are invited to submit a response to the questions above and a description of their capabilities and experience. Additionally, information regarding type of business, i.e., Large, Small, Woman-Owned, Veteran or Disadvantaged business concern should be provided. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this RFI includes but not limited to 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services and 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.

Total response to this RFI should be limited to 25 pages. Vendors who submit written responses may be invited to augment their written responses with a 2-3 hour oral presentation at a later date. 

The Team requests that an electronic submission of this market research be received by the Government no later than close of business local time on October 31, 2011 to the Contracting Officer at the following email: michael.blumenfeld@noaa.gov.

All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government 

Any information provided in response to this RFI will be used for informational and planning purposes only and will not be returned. All proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. All information submitted by respondents to this RFI, including appropriately marked proprietary information, will be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:neisha.m.mendiola@us.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) has a contract, W9113M-07-C-0177, with The Boeing Company, Directed Energy Systems (Boeing, DES), 4411 The 25 Way NE, Albuquerque, NM 87109-5857, cage code 0YBJ7.  This contract is for test and integration of the High Energy Laser Technology Demonstrator (HEL TD) Beam Control System (BCS) with a low power solid state laser (LPSSL) along with sustainment of support equipment/vehicles in a counter rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) scenario.  The HEL TD Program Office, Huntsville, AL, has a requirement for a follow-on effort to integrate and test the same BCS with government or commercially developed high power solid state laser (HPSSL) along with sustainment of support equipment/vehicles in a C-RAM scenario.  This effort will utilize a 10kw solid state laser coupled to an existing HEL TD BCS to engage selected threat targets.  The USASMDC/ARSTRAT issues this Pre-solicitation Notice to inform all interested parties that we intend to negotiate and award this follow-on effort as a modification to the existing contract with Boeing, DES.  Contract W9113M-07-C-0177 will be modified to include integration and testing of BCS with SSLTE/HPSSL and sustainment of support equipment/vehicles in a C-RAM scenario with the option to; a) integrate and utilize government furnished adaptive optics (AO); b) integrate and utilize additional command and control; c) restore vehicle platform; e) integrate and utilize government furnished solid state laser (SSL).  This contract modification will result in an increase of the current contract ceiling.  This action is pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C   2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement".  A pre-solicitation notice for this effort was posted on August 2010 with an estimated award date of first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2011.  Due to changes in the program's priority the award of this effort was postponed.  The effort is now planned for award on FY 2012 with a period of performance of thirty-six months from date of award.  Boeing, DES is the designer, developer, producer, and integrator of the current BCS and vehicle platform.  Boeing, DES is the only source having the knowledge, capability, equipment and specialized personnel necessary to effectively and efficiently accomplish this effort without substantial duplication of cost and delay in program execution.  This is due to their possession of a product that already meets contractual requirements for the future effort in question and established momentum on performing the current contractual effort.  This action is directed towards Boeing, DES only.  This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are not available.  All notices of interest or inquiries shall be in writing and directed to the cognizant Contracting Officer, Neisha M. Mendiola, at neisha.mendiola@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis.

MCC-D:  
MCC-D shall be a 42 cell MCC.
Replacement of MCC-D will require a new feeder to be installed from the basement of Bldg.200, from MS-2 panel board to the penthouse location.  The contractor is provide a new Breaker in MS-2 for 400 Amp rating for this new feed.  Recently a similar electrical feed was installed from EMS-B on the exterior of the building to the penthouse, approximate linear run was 300 Feet.  The VA will be providing the 600 MCM wire for this installation.  This wire is located on site or can be delivered to the contractor to be spooled for installation.  The VA would like a similar installation for this new feed for MCC-D. This project will include painting of the exterior conduit with marine paint type application on the existing conduit and the new.  This new feed will connect to the new MCC-D in its new location, see drawing A.  This feed will be 600 kcmil size wires, 3 wires and a ground in the conduit.  The contractor will need to install the appropriate conduit size and pull boxes required for this installation.  The contractor will also provide the wire and labor necessary to install the wire rating necessary for the project.  The VA is specifying Eaton Motor Control Center equipment due to its Arch Flash safety device features which will make this installation very simple.  Without completing a large shutdown, the VA would like to have both MCC-D, new and old activated at the same time to allow a faster switch over of each load independently allowing only small shutdowns for each device.  The contractor shall have the new MCC-D 100% installed and ready for load transfer.  The contractor shall prepare and install all re-routing conduits and junction boxes before the first shutdown is scheduled.  Once the entire load of MCC-D has been transferred and connected to the new MCC-D, old MCC-D shall be demolished and removed.  New MCC-D has a load schedule below showing each planned transferred load and spares located which will be filled with an adjustable breaker. New MCC-D rating is minimum 600 Amps, 480/277.    

Before MCC-D can be replaced, EF-200 will need to be replaced and relocated to top of the penthouse.  The contractor shall provide a new 2,500 CFM exhaust fan shall be baked epoxy coated.  The contractor shall also provide and install a new stainless steel disconnect for this fan. The contractor shall be responsible to for re-routing the existing ductwork and provide new ductwork as needed for this install.  The contractor shall demolish the old exhaust fan and is existing curb.       

MCC-E and X:  
MCC-E shall be a 21 cell MCC.
MCC-X shall be a 14 cell MCC.
Once MCC-D has been replaced, in its original location will be the new MCC-E and new MCC-X location.  Each MCC has a load schedule below showing existing load, and spare locations which shall have an breaker installed.  There are three emergency feeds that feed existing MCC-E and MCC-X; a 100 amp, 200 amp, and 400 amp feed.  See one line diagrams attached to reference the feeds.  When both MCC are completely installed, MCC-E will be fed by a 400 amp feed; that it is fed from now.  MCC-X will have a 200 feed which exists but not yet activated.  The 200 amp feed is not connected, but coiled up inside the MCC-E.  The 100 amp feed will be abandoned and leads will be removed from the breaker in panel EMS-B.  The 200 amp feed leads will need to be landed on an existing 200 amp breaker located in panel EMS-B.  The equipment on both of these MCCs must have short shut down times either for load transfer or temporary feeds.  MCC-E shall be a minimum of 400 Amp 480/277 V.  MCC-X shall be a minimum rating of 200 Amps 480/277 V.

MCC-F: 
MCC-F shall be a 42 cell MCC.
MCC-F will be replaced and the new MCC-F will be placed in the same location.  The existing loads on MCC-F will be temporarily fed from the new MCC-D during replacement.  The existing feed for MCC-F is a bus tie off the existing MCC-D.  When new MCC-F is completely installed, it will be fed from the existing feed of MCC-D, as new MCC-D will have a new feed installed during the project.  MCC-F has a load schedule below, showing existing loads and spares that will be installed for the new MCC-F.  MCC-F minimum rating is 400 Amps, 480/277.  With the replacement of MCC-F, a new door will be cut into the existing louver section of the North side of the penthouse, near MCC-F location.  This door should be 4' wide minimum, with appropriate lockset shown in specification section 010000. This will allow the contractor to access the penthouse for easier delivery of these electrical items. 

Interested parties shall be required to demonstrate verification in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz CVE Database. 

The VA wishes to thank all firms interested in this project.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein. <br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure a minimum of 86 each "B-1 Wheel Heat Shields" as part of a follow-on Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for continued development of the B-1. The B-1 Wheel Heat Shields are considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the brake system. Brake systems are designed to let the heat out a certain way so that things cool quickly without causing some of the surrounding components (brake housing, wheels, etc.) to get too hot which would result in a failure. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the B-1 Wheel Heat Shield it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. That is why it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Meggitt Aircraft Braking System's own expense. Since the data required to manufacture the B-1 Wheel Heat Shields are limited to Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the entire B-1 wheel and brake package at their own expense. It should also be noted that the current B-1 Wheel Heat Shields (NSN 1630-01-228-3644/Part Number 5008532) are undergoing Wheel and Brake System Improvement (WBSI) with a projected implementation of NOV 2013 through FEB 2015, making the current B-1 Wheel Heat Shields obsolete. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.
<p>NSN: 1630-01-228-3644<br />Part Number: 5008532<br />Noun: Wheel, Heat Shield<br />System: B-1<br />Quantity: 86 <br />PR: Multiple Purchase Requests as Required</p>

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) <br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) r the Customer Service Directorate, Customer Relationship Interface. <br /><br />USCIS is conducting market research into whether it can more effectively receive and respond to an array of customer inquiries from mobile devices, such as, but not limited to, smartphones and tablets. USCIS wants to be able to address general inquiries and case-specific questions in the most timely, efficient, and effective ways available. USCIS is eager to learn of and consider the newest, most innovative models of customer service using mobile devices. The information USCIS receives will assist USCIS in shaping future requirements with the goal of implementing new service models at the earliest possible time. <br /><br />USCIS interacts with a diverse public customer base with a wide range of education, technological access, capabilities, and purposes. USCIS administers a wide array of benefits reflecting the diversity of its customers and their needs. The processes to obtain immigration benefits similarly vary, sometimes including in-person interviews and often not involving direct personal contact between the agency and the applicant. The volume of applications USCIS receives is high, ranging from approximately six to seven million annually. Accompanying the high volume of applications is a higher volume of customer inquiries, sometimes general in nature and other times case-specific. USCIS currently receives approximately 14 million customer inquiries annually and employs a variety of methods to receive and respond to them. <br /><br />Smartphones are the highest selling consumer electronic devices in the world. US sales of smartphones is expected to grow from 67 million in 2010 to 95 million this year. Worldwide there were 302.6 million smart phones in 2010 and sales are expected to reach 500 million by 2012. At current rates the number of Internet users who use smartphones to access the Internet will exceed those who use laptops or PCs to do so by the end of 2012. <br /><br />The current USCIS customer model is to provide information through its web site and through the National Customer Service Center using traditional call center techniques. USCIS is not wedded to these techniques and seeks information on the use of the internet through the use of an application or applications for mobile devices to provide services in the following areas: <br /><br />&#9679; Provide USICS customers updated case status from a given receipt number (Web Version https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/Dashboard/CaseStatus.do) <br /><br />&#9679; Provide USCIS customers the ability to change their mailing address via the mobile application (Web Version https://egov.uscis.gov/crisgwi/go?action=coa) <br />&#9679; Provide USCIS customers filing times (Web Version https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do?locale=en-US) <br /><br />&#9679; Provide USCIS customers the ability to create E-request. (Web Version https://egov.uscis.gov/e-Request/Intro.do?locale=en_US) <br /><br />USCIS fields inquiries that can involve both Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Please discuss generically how such information can be protected, whether a cellphone or WIFI connection is being used. <br /><br />USCIS is interested in ways to provide customer service that are flexible, have room for growth, and that can act as a foundation for expanded and effective customer interaction. <br /><br />Interested parties are requested to submit information on the process of developing and making available to the public applications for mobile devices that would enable USCIS to provide information to interested customers. Include in this discussion how to address issues raised by the different operating systems. <br /><br />Information submitted should include a company profile, a description of experience with mobile applications, a list of mobile applications created, operating systems used, and the devices these applications were created for/used on. Please include a capability statement if your company has one and you company web site address. Provide no more than three case studies of applications created. <br /><br />Provide generic information on how your company prices the design, development and implementation of applications to including texting options, the use of databases, web sites, communications, and portal access for viewing metrics. Additionally, provide generic information on potential infrastructure needed to support the use of these applications that the Government may want to provide as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). <br /><br />Information shall be submitted electronically by email, using Microsoft 2003 or compatible software. If newer versions of Microsoft Office are used, then Office 2003 must still be able to open the documents. The Government is not responsible for any format changes due to the use of a newer version of Microsoft Office. The email address for submissions is ContractingProposals@dhs.gov, cc&rsquo;ing Stephen.k.hill@dhs.gov. Include a cover letter with contact information. The Capability Statement should be submitted as a separate electronic document. The overall submission, excluding the Capability Statement, is limited to fifteen (15) pages.

<DESC>The Division of Cardiovascular Sciences of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to establish one (1) Coordinating Center as part of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) renewal. The JHS also involves a Field Center, Training and Education Center and a Community Outreach Center. Awards for the JHS are anticipated to be made in June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2018. <br /><br />The JHS is a multi-center investigation of predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 5301 African-Americans living in Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties surrounding the Jackson, MS metropolitan area. The JHS represents an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study to increase data collection in an African American population, and improve access to and the participation of African American populations and scientists in biomedical research and professions. The JHS was initiated in 1998 as a collaborative effort among three Jackson-area academic institutions. At the close of the current contracts in May 2013, the JHS will have completed three back-to-back cohort examinations that have produced extensive longitudinal data on traditional and putative CVD risk factors, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors and biochemical analytes; measures of subclinical disease from echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart, aorta and abdomen; and stored biological samples. Eighty-two percent of the surviving JHS participants (N = 4203) completed Exam 2; projected retention for Exam 3 is 80% (N = 4082). In addition, the JHS has conducted annual cohort follow-up contacts for incident clinical events of interest, a variety of community education and outreach activities to promote healthy lifestyles to reduce disease risk burden, and level-appropriate academic training programs to promote and support public health research.<br />The objectives of the renewal of the JHS program are to <br />1) Support dedicated time for JHS investigators to conduct data analysis and prepare manuscripts using the wealth of data collected<br />2) Facilitate access to study resources and expertise in order to <br />&bull; Engage researchers beyond the JHS, including early career investigators, in collaborative analysis of existing data to produce high quality publications<br />&bull; Serve as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students to help ameliorate the shortage of minority biomedical researchers<br />&bull; Serve as a platform for ancillary studies<br />3) Conduct annual phone interviews with participants to identify interim hospitalizations and outpatient medical visits, convey information about the JHS, and serve as a vehicle to recruit for ancillary studies<br />4) Continue clinical events identification, investigation, and validation to improve statistical power for risk prediction and hypothesis testing<br />5) Perform community health education activities to disseminate health promotion and prevention messages in the Jackson community.

<CONTACT>Michael Fanizzo; michael.fanizzo@navy.mil
<DESC>To support deployed units operating from remote, land-based sites, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has a requirement to procure integrated energy generation, management, and storage systems; solar/ DC-powered refrigeration systems; and man-portable water purification systems.  In accordance with energy reduction initiatives, NAVFAC seeks to reduce reliance on fuel and water resupply through the use of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies. 

For each deliverable/ system, responses should provide 1) equipment specifications, 2) performance/ capabilities data, 3) equipment configurations, 4) estimated life cycle costs, including acquisition, maintenance, and other relevant costs, 5) available logistic support packages, and 6) approximate lead times from order to delivery.

The deliverables are: 

1)INTEGRATED ENERGY GENERATION, MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE SYSTEMS 

NAVFAC requires two sizes: 
a) A system matched to the Navys 3kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG) providing 1.8Kw of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day; and 

b) A system matched with up to 70kW power provided by either the Navys 60kW TQGs or two 35kW generators, with 48kW of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day.
 

Tactical generators provide spot power and are sized for peak load, which means the generators often run under a poor load factor and outside of the range where they are most efficient. NAVFAC requires a system that can run currently deployed generators at an ideal load factor and dump the unconsumed power into a load bank. Once charged, the system would utilize the load bank as its primary power source until the power demand exceeded the load banks capacity, at which time the system would automatically restart the generator. NAVFAC seeks to reduce the fuel consumption of currently deployed, inefficiently loaded generators by 70% or more.

The system should also harvest power from optional, renewable energy sources (solar is the primary interest).
  Transportability, ruggedness, and reliability are also system considerations.


2)MAN-PORTABLE WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS
By using local water sources (e.g., wells, rivers and streams) for drinking water, deployed forces can significantly reduce their logistics tail.  NAVFAC intends to procure systems that can purify fresh water to NSF International Protocol P248 standards at a minimum rate of 700 gallons/day. 
The system must take its power from a 110v 15A circuit and an alternative energy source consisting of photovoltaic cells.  The photovoltaic system shall be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.
  The system must be transportable by a maximum of two people.


3)SOLAR/DC-POWERED REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS
 To extend the time between resupply missions, NAVFAC intends to procure solar/DC-powered systems providing for cold storage of food and packaged water. NAVFAC will consider systems ranging in size from a minimum of 5.8CF/165L to a maximum of 13 CF/365L.  The systems shall maintain food and packaged water between 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 4 degrees Celsius) when operating in ambient temperatures from 55 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 40 degrees Celsius). 
The system must include its own power/refrigeration system that operates independent of operator-provided power generation systems, but must also have the capability to run on 120 VAC.
  If alternative energy collection systems are included, photovoltaic systems must be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.


This is a market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will come from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation, to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), Systems Engineering and Evaluation (SE&amp;E) Directorate has implemented a joint program, the Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program+10 (ITRAP+10), with the European Commission, Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (JRC). The purpose of ITRAP+10 is to conduct an evaluation and comparison of the performance of available radiation detection equipment relevant to nuclear security. The results will provide an independent assessment of available radiation detection equipment on the market which will serve as a reference for regulatory and other authorities to identify equipment and or families of equipment to address their particular needs, and potentially help to ensure common standards on an international level. The overall scope of this project is to assist organizations in effectively detecting radioactive materials nationally and crossing borders illegally, whether importations, exportations, or shipments in transit, and by developing recommendations that describe the technical and functional requirements for the selection of radiation detection equipment so that resources are deployed in an efficient way.
<p>DNDO is seeking information on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems designed for radiological/nuclear monitoring instruments that can be used at and inside the borders by law enforcement agencies for the following categories: Gamma Search Devices (GSDs), Neutron Search Devices (NSDs), and Spectrometric Personal Radiation Detectors (SPRDs). <br />Interested parties who have already provided responses to the request for information originally published on 30 September 2010 (RFI-ITRAP-FY10) need not re-apply.</p>
<p>All questions and responses for this RFI should be sent via email to DNDOITRAP@dhs.gov and to the Contracting Officer, Willie Lindsey at Willie.Lindsey@dhs.gov. Responses are due no later than 4:30 PM (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, January 25, 2012. Questions and responses sent to any other email address will not be accepted.</p>

Salient Characteristics 

"	Ever Cross .035 PTA Balloon, 135 cm catheter length:
 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
Dilatation balloon catheters are used to exert radial force to dilate narrow vessel segments. The Ever Cross 0.035" OTW PTA Dilatation Catheter is an over the wire (OTW) 0.035" dual lumen catheter (1) with a distally mounted semi-compliant inflatable balloon (2) and antraumatic tapered tip (3). The distal portion of the catheter has a hydrophilic coating (4).
The manifold (5) includes a lumen marked "THRU" (6). This is the central lumen of the catheter, which terminates at the distal tip. This lumen is used to pass the catheter over a guide-wire with a maximum diameter of 0.035". The lumen marked "BALLOON" (7) is the balloon inflation lumen, which is used to inflate and deflate the dilatation balloon with a mixture of contrast medium and saline solution. The balloon has two radiopaque markers (8) for positioning the balloon relative to the stenosis. The radiopaque marker bands indicate the dilating or working section of the balloon (9). 
The Ever Cross 0.035" OTW PTA Dilatation Catheter is available in multiple balloon sizes. Nominal balloon diameter and length are printed on the strain relief (10). All balloons distend to sizes above the nominal size at pressures greater than the nominal pressure


"	Nano Cross .014 PTA Balloon Catheter
 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
Dilatation balloon catheters are used to exert radial force to dilate narrow vessel segments. The Nano-Cross .014" OTW PTA Dilatation Catheter is an over the wire (OTW) 0.014" coaxial lumen catheter (1) with a distally mounted semi-compliant inflatable balloon (2) and an atraumatic tapered tip (3). The distal portion of the catheter and the balloon has a hydrophilic coating (4).
The manifold (5) includes a lumen marked "THRU" (6). This is the central lumen of the catheter, which terminates at the distal tip. This lumen is used to pass the catheter over a guide-wire with a maximum diameter of 0.014". The lumen marked "BALLOON" (7) is the balloon inflation lumen, which is used to inflate and deflate the dilatation balloon with a mixture of contrast medium and saline solution. All balloons have two radiopaque marker bands (8) for positioning the balloon working area (9). On the 210 mm device, two additional marker bands (11) denote the middle of the balloon body (9). 
The 210 mm device includes a tapered balloon that tapers 0.5 mm proximal to distal. For the 210 mm device, the labeled balloon diameter on the strain relief indicates the proximal balloon diameter. Refer to package label for additional information. All balloons distend to sizes above the nominal size at pressures greater than the nominal pressure. 

"	Protg Ever-Flex Self-Expanding Biliary Stent
DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Protg Ever Flex Self-Expanding Biliary Stent System is a self-expanding Nitinol stent system designed for the palliative treatment of malignant neoplasms in the biliary tree. The self-expanding stent is made of a nickel titanium alloy (Nitinol)and comes pre-mounted on a 6F 0.035" over-the-wire delivery system. The stent is cut from a Nitinol tube into an open lattice design and has tantalum radiopaque markers at the proximal and distal ends of the stent. Upon deployment, the stent achieves its predetermined diameter and exerts a constant, gentle outward force to establish patency in the biliary ducts. The Delivery System is comprised of an inner shaft (1) and outer (2) sheath, which are locked together with a safety lock (3). The nylon inner shaft terminates distally in a flexible catheter tip (4) and originates proximally at the hub (5). Two radiopaque markers, one marker distal (6) and one
marker/retainer proximal (7) to the constrained stent, are on the inner shaft. The outer sheath connects proximally to the Y-adapter (8). The self-expanding stent is constrained within the space between
the inner shaft and outer sheath. This space is flushed prior to the procedure through the stopcock (9). The outer sheath has a radiopaque marker at its distal end (10). Stent positioning at the target stricture is achieved prior to deployment by utilizing the two radiopaque markers on the inner shaft,
and the radiopaque markers on the stent. For stent deployment, the safety lock is turned counterclockwise to unlock the outer sheath. The outer sheath retraction is achieved by pulling the distal grip (11) toward the proximal grip (12). Complete deployment of the stent is achieved when the radiopaque marker on the outer sheath


"	Spider FX Distal Protection Device
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The Spider FX Embolic Protection Device is a percutaneously delivered distal embolic protection device, designed to capture and remove dislodged debris during interventional procedures. The Spider FX Device Capture Wire is used as the 0.014 in. wire for interventional device delivery. The Spider FX Device can be delivered over any 0.014 in. or 0.018 in. primary wire used to gain access to the lesion site.

The Spider FX Embolic Protection Device package contains the following components:

One Capture Wire composed of a nitinol mesh Filter with a Distal Floppy Tip, mounted on a 190 cm or a convertible 320/190 cm PTFE-coated 0.014 in. stainless steel wire. The Filter features a heparin-coating designed to maintain patency during Filter deployment1. This Capture Wire acts as the primary guide-wire for other interventional devices compatible with a 0.014 in. wire. This convertible Capture Wire is scored, allowing the wire to be snapped to a 190 cm usable length for use with rapid exchange systems, if desired. The distal portion of the Capture Wire for rapid exchange use is gold. The proximal portion for standard over-the-wire use is black. 

1 The heparin coating is intended to maintain Filter patency, and should not have a systemic effect in the patient.

One dual-ended Spider FX Catheter used to exchange the primary access guide-wire with the Capture Wire, deploy the Capture Wire at the desired location, and recover the Capture Wire at the end of the procedure.

One 23 gauge Blunt Needle for attachment to a syringe with Luer connector for priming and flushing the Catheter.

Components are delivered sterile, for use within a single vessel only. Do not re-sterilize or reuse.

<DESC>Synopsis: Request for Information (RFI) Cyberspace Science and Technology<br /><br />1. Description<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) on cyberspace science and technology (S&amp;T) research, operational concepts, and mission support innovations to support Air Force projected missions in the near-term (FY2012-15), mid-term (FY2016-20) and far-term (FY2021-25). NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY PROPOSAL OR INFORMATION SUBMISSION AND SUBMITTING INFORMATION DOES NOT BIND THE AIR FORCE FOR ANY FUTURE CONTRACTS/GRANTS RESULTING FROM THIS RFI. <br /><br />2. Background and Requested Information<br /><br />The Air Force is requesting information on revolutionary cyberspace science and technologies that address the challenge of future Air Force cyberspace needs in cyberspace exploitation, defense, and operations for potential inclusion in the <em>Air Force Cyber Vision 2025</em> study. Cyber Vision 2025 is a study to create an integrated, Air Force-wide, near-, mid- and far-term S&amp;T vision to advance revolutionary cyber capabilities to support core Air Force missions. Cyber Vision 2025 will identify state of the art S&amp;T and best practices in government and the private sector. It will analyze current and forecasted capabilities, threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences across core AF missions to identify key S&amp;T gaps and opportunities. It will articulate an AF near- (FY2012-15), mid- (FY2016-20) and far-term (FY2021-25) S&amp;T vision to fill gaps, indicating where AF should lead (creating or inventing novel solutions for core AF missions), follow (by adopting, adapting, or augmenting others investments), or watch key technologies. In alignment with the national security cyber strategy, the study is intended to address cyber S&amp;T across Air Force core missions (air, space, cyber, and Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR)) including DOTMLPF (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities) considerations, engaging with industry, academia, national laboratories, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and government to leverage capabilities and experience. <br /><br />The Air Force seeks the assured cyber advantage across air, space, cyber, C2ISR and mission support where these key dimensions are defined as:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61550; <em>Assured</em> - Ensured operations in congested, competitive, contested, and denied environments in spite of increased dependencies, vulnerabilities, and threats.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61550; <em>Cyber</em> - its defense, exploitation, operation<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61550; <em>Advantage</em> - an immunity, resilience, speed, agility, and effectiveness edge over our adversaries to ensure operational dominance <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61550; <em>Across</em> - supremacy within and across missions<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61550; <em>Air, space, cyber, C2ISR, mission support</em> - we require full spectrum cyber solutions<br /><br />The Air Force operates missions in and through cyberspace, a human-created domain that knows no geographic boundaries (in contrast to air, land, sea and space). Cyberspace capabilities encompass not only hardware, software, information, and services, but also individuals, organizations, and missions. Air Force cyber requirements encompass cyber exploitation, defense and operations as well as doctrine, workforce development (education and training), acquisition and support. Cyber vulnerabilities open the way for exploitation by a range of threats. Threats include but are not limited to external, internal, supply chain, and may employ a diversity of methods such as denial, deception or social engineering and may have objectives of theft, disruption, and even physical destruction. Operations must be assured by mitigating vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit and developing strategies and technology that assure missions in contested cyber environments. Special attention must be paid to dependencies on critical infrastructure and interdependencies with the defense industrial base, commercial providers, academia, non-profits and federal laboratories. While the Air Force cyber vision will remain within Title 10 authorities for organizing, training and equipping, a collaborative approach and peer review across other services, agencies and federal departments and coalition partners will ensure appropriate coordination with relevant defense, homeland security, and intelligence authorities. <br /><br />The Air Force is seeking information on revolutionary hardware and software cyber technology and systems as well as innovative Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) that will support, augment and in some cases extend mission range and scope. In addition, the Air Force is interested in operational innovations that provide immediate and long-term applicable, cost-effective operational capability and technological superiority for Air Force operations. Also of interest are enabling mission support elements and supporting best practices that provide the foundation for cyber capabilities across the other domains. <br /><br />Assured cyber advantage is critical in all domains in which the Air Force operates. The Air Force must maintain its dominance of air, space, cyber, and C2ISR fixed and expeditionary operations. All domains have unique challenges, but each requires cyber solutions, therefore, a portfolio of technologies is required to meet the wide spectrum of future Air Force requirements.
<p>AIR<br /><br />A crucial part of achieving the Air Force mission involves obtaining and maintaining superiority in the air domain. Within that domain, forces exercise degrees of control or levels of influence, characterized as parity, superiority, or supremacy. The US has enjoyed air superiority in all conflicts since the Korean War, however, near-peer competitors and future contested and anti-access/area denial environments raise the possibility of air parity or even the risk of conceding superiority to the adversary. The asymmetrical dependence on cyber of our air platforms renders air superiority in a contested cyber environment even more elusive. Independently, the US Air Force is often the first responder in times of crisis-to lay down expeditionary bases and create the backbone of critical supply lines. Cyber is a key enabler in maintaining air superiority and an ability to promptly react to natural disasters or human-caused contingencies. <br /><br />The Air Force seeks information on how cyber technologies can be defended or employed to ensure air superiority. Several cyber technologies need to be researched in the coming years to continue our success in the air domain. These include, but are not limited to, methods for mathematical representation of weapon system requirements, formal verification that implementations satisfy the security properties of specifications, test and evaluation in contested environments across the entire acquisition lifecycle, improvements in modeling and simulation for platform and weapon design as well as operator training, software for guidance, navigation and control, secure air-to-air and air-to-ground data links, anti-tamper technologies, encryption, high performance on-board processing, autonomous operations, advanced human machine interfaces, intelligent sensors, smart munitions, and the entire logistics systems.</p>
<p>SPACE<br /><br />Military forces have always viewed controlling the "high ground" as a position of dominance and advantage in warfare. With rare exceptions, whoever owned the high ground owned the fight. Space assets offer an expansive view of the Earth, operating high above the planet's surface; satellites can see deep into an adversary's territory, with little risk to humans or machines. Today, control of space as the ultimate high ground is critical for space superiority and assures the force-multiplying capabilities of space power. Tomorrow, space superiority may enable instant engagement anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Space assets have not only enhanced our national security but have also fundamentally changed military operations. Space power is defined as the total strength of a nation's capabilities to conduct and influence activities to, in, through, and from space to achieve its objectives. Space power is integrated throughout joint operations as both an enabler and a force multiplier. The Air Force views cyber operations supporting, enabling or controlling space assets and missions as a key ingredient for achieving battlespace superiority.</p>
<p>Space operations are essential to space power, providing a uniquely persistent presence over key areas of the world through the effective employment of space capabilities. Space power provides the joint fight with permanently "forward-deployed" satellites and adds another dimension to the joint force's ability to posture quickly and achieve battlespace superiority. Space power bolsters US global presence because it is not limited by terrestrial anti-access concerns. Airmen exploit this global presence and produce force-multiplying capabilities like instant global communications, timely missile warning, near-persistent surveillance and reconnaissance, and precise positioning, navigation and timing (PNT).</p>
<p>In order to ensure continued dominance in this domain, continued investment into enabling cyberspace technologies is required. These include ground stations; telecommunications hardware, software and protocols; cyber S&amp;T for rocket engines and satellites in space as well as satellite control and data processing centers on the ground. For example, intelligent space maneuver could provide extended life for assets in orbit, autonomous satellite command-and-control as well as establishing intelligent ground processing centers that would help address responsiveness, resiliency, and readiness requirements.</p>
<p>CYBER<br /><br />Air Force missions across the air, space and cyber domain are increasingly dependent on cyberspace operations. Cyberspace is a source of both strength and vulnerability. The almost annual doubling of the cyber technology base has created critical vulnerabilities for our adversaries to attack and exploit. Expanded interconnectivity through cyberspace has exposed previously isolated critical infrastructures vital to national security, public health, and economic well-being. Adversaries may attempt to deny, degrade, manipulate, disrupt, or destroy critical infrastructures and AF missions through cyberspace attack, thus affecting warfighting systems and the nation as a whole. The Air Force must have assured, trusted, resilient and affordable communications and networks to effectively and confidently execute its mission to protect and defend this nation. The Air Force is interested in S&amp;T and operational support innovations that can assure missions, dynamically map cyberspace with critical mission functions and provide integrated mission/cyber situation awareness. Technology is required that will provide trusted, resilient and agile architectures that can mitigate risks, limit adverse consequences and /or enable operating through a cyber attack. Analysis of COTS to assess threats and vulnerabilities is of interest. Validation and verification methods are sought which will ensure an in-depth knowledge and trust in COTS and GOTS hardware and software components prior to their usage in weapon systems.</p>
<p>Techniques which will augment human performance to provide force-multiplication through cyberspace are sought. S&amp;T for Integrated Full Spectrum Cyberspace Operations to develop and demonstrate trusted, validated, verified capabilities capable of delivering a full range of cyber effects and a means to measure and assess the effectiveness and degree of assurance of a delivered cyber effect prior to usage are of interest. Technology and techniques which will provide new opportunities for AF advantage in cyber operations and support are sought.</p>
<p>C2ISR <br /><br />Command and Control (C2) is the exercise of authority and the direction by a commander over assigned and attached forces in accomplishment of the mission, typically operating in a monitor, assess, plan, and execute (MAPE) process which requires global situational awareness, cross domain course of action analysis and selection, surveillance and strike coordination, execution monitoring, and battle damage assessment. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) is planning and directing intelligence activities, collecting critical information, processing data, analyzing information, building intelligence products, and disseminating intelligence to support planning, decision making, and execution of operations. C2ISR provides a persistent, collaborative environment comprised of people, processes, systems, and tools to support a broad mix of military options - offensive, defensive, kinetic and non-kinetic. C2ISR is conducted in and through cyberspace, an essential enabler and employer of C2ISR. In other words, C2 and ISR for air, space, and cyber operations use the assets, information, and services of cyberspace. <br />Many parallels exist between operations in the more traditional domains of air and space and in the emerging domain of cyberspace. As we integrate these capabilities, planning requirements for cyber assets mirror those for traditional ISR and combat assets. However, the practice of procedural versus positive control over air assets and the time scales of the C2 planning and execution cycles do not translate well to cyberspace where decision cycles hover around a fraction of a second. Conversely, placing cyber assets under procedural control requires the incorporation of a set of previously agreed upon rules for a broad range of future scenarios. Integrated planning must take into consideration the challenges of cyberspace deconfliction, Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF) procedures and the potential of cyber fratricide and cross-domain (air/space/cyber) fratricide. The ability to tag and identify cyber assets and to continuously ascertain their status and integrity creates technical challenges unique to cyberspace. <br /><br />Simply porting technologies developed for C2ISR in the air and space domain may not be directly applicable or useful in the cyber domain. The integration of kinetic assets and the effects they produce are at a formative stage. C2 capabilities for monitoring, assessing, planning, and executing cyber operations need to be designed, developed, and implemented to be interoperable with existing air and space capabilities. The Air Force is interested in novel and unique approaches to enable C2ISR in an environment that is not constrained by time, distance, and geographical boundaries. <br /><br />CYBER MISSION SUPPORT<br /><br />Mission support provides the foundation that enables global engagement and is a linchpin that ties together Air Force core competencies. It includes those actions taken to create, deploy, employ, generate, sustain, protect, and redeploy cyberspace personnel, assets, and capabilities through all peacetime and wartime military operations. The Air Force is interested in innovative solutions to key cyber mission support challenges including, but not limited to, training and education, workforce development, test and evaluation, timely and relevant acquisition of cyber technologies, and incorporation of sound cyber practices throughout the acquisition of Air Force weapon systems.</p>
<p>New modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) approaches are critical to integrating cyber techniques into our military operations. M&amp;S tools need to assess effectiveness of cyber capabilities and actions for operations, planning, acquisition, and testing. Planning tools, much like those available for kinetic weapons that exist in the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM), are need for cyber. The Cyber JMEM needs to expand beyond its two current applications to address the wide range of cyber military activities. Also, the additional target attributes and data that could be exploited by cyber techniques are a necessary development. Finally, development of evaluation tools that can capture the effects of combined kinetic and non-kinetic operations are necessary. The scientific and technology community should support the advancement of the analytics for effective and efficient acquisition and use of future cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>REVOLUTIONARY S&amp;T</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in <em>revolutionary</em> cyberspace concepts and innovative solutions that can meet the challenging cyber needs of the Air Force. These solutions are sought for all mission areas including air, space, cyber, C2ISR, and mission support. Described technologies should also indicate the areas of improvement over current state of the art technologies in quantitative metrics including, but not limited to, efficiency, effectiveness, robustness, resiliency, size, cost and sustainability. The Air Force is interested in solutions not focused exclusively on commercial viability but rather game changing revolutionary advances. Innovative basic cyber science research is also of interest if there is concrete evidence of technical viability such as peer-reviewed publication, prototypes, or demonstrations as well as cross cutting applicability to two or more mission domains. The focus of the submissions should be on advanced technology solutions in the idea generation or early development stages.</p>
<p>THREAT</p>
<p>The global scope of DoD and Air Force networks and systems presents adversaries with broad opportunities for exploitation and attack. U.S. adversaries may seek to exploit, disrupt, deny or degrade the networks and systems the Air Force depends upon 24/7 for global operations. The threats to cyberspace are presented from external threat actors, insiders, and via supply chain vulnerabilities. Of particular concern are the threat activities which result in the theft and exploitation of data, disruption or denial of access or service, and destructive activity that threatens to destroy or degrade networks or connected systems. While the threat to intellectual property is often less visible than the threat to the air, space, cyberspace, C2ISR and mission support areas, it may be the most pervasive threat to the Air Force today. As military strength ultimately depends on economic vitality, sustained intellectual property losses erode both U.S. military effectiveness and national competitiveness in the global economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately there are significant risks inherent in relying on cyberspace as the DoD and Air Force will continue to leverage cyberspace to execute its mission more effectively and efficiently. Adversaries will continually adjust their tools and tactics, making a perfect defense impossible. Thus the importance and urgency for an integrated, Air Force-wide, near-, mid-, and far-term science and technologies vision to advance revolutionary cyber capabilities to support core Air Force missions. RFI responses addressing cyber solutions in the air, space, cyberspace, C2ISR, mission support, threat analysis or projections, and revolutionary S&amp;T areas should address adversary threats which may exploit, disrupt, deny or degrade Air Force data, networks, systems and mission in the near-, mid-, and far-term range. Innovative methods and insights into how to most effectively forecast and anticipate future threats are also welcome.</p>

This should include a technology readiness level, manufacturing readiness level (if appropriate), and cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Applicability to Future Air Force needs (optional) (1 page only)<br /><br />Identify and expound upon the most desirable application through the Air Force, concentrating on the added capability this solution provides that currently does not exist. Make it clear how this revolutionary S&amp;T addresses AF specific needs, distinct from those of other government organizations (e.g., DoE, ARPA-E, Army, Navy, Marines) although relating and leveraging these organizations as appropriate. The description should state if this is an area where the Air Force is expected to be a technology leader (lead AF mission and lead investor), follower (adopt, adapt, or augment an effort external to the AF), or watcher. <br /><br />Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing sufficient detail to adequately convey the technical capabilities these innovative solutions have to the Air Force mission.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to extend the services of the current Joint Fires Observer Course (JFOC) contract, for a base period of performance beginning 5 February 2012 - 4 September 2012, plus two (2) one-month options.  A competitive contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660 by MICC Ft Eustis. This is an extension of the current bridge contract and will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, W9124L-10-P-0141, which was awarded at MICC Fort Sill-Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and will expire on 4 February 2012. This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The extension will be issued to the current contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This extension will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS .  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 150 days to obtain for the JFO Course.  Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this ten month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 541990.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Deidra Zerzavy:  deidra.zerzavy@us.army.mil or Karen Warner:  karen.l.warner@us.army.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill Contracting Office.<br><br><br><br>

<DESC><br />The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Office of Forensic Sciences intends to award a purchase order to American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB), under the sole source authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. The purpose of this purchase order is to maintain the accreditation of DEA's forensic laboratories. <br /><br />DEA's forensic laboratory system achieved accreditation under ISO 17025 and ASCLD/LAB supplemental requirements through the ASCLD/LAB International Program in 2010. Each accreditation remains in effect for five years with payment of an annual accreditation fee. <br /><br />A sole source purchase is appropriate because ASCLD/LAB is the original organization that inspected the DEA laboratories and granted the certificates and is the only entity that can validate each laboratory's ASCLD/LAB International Certificate of Accreditation and approve maintenance of these Certificates of Accreditation for each laboratory.

<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the referenced services and updates can only be provided by Motorola, Inc., as they are the developers and manufacturers of the test equipment. Further, in order to maintain the warranty agreement for the originally procured equipment, having services rendered by any other company would void the present warranty agreement and subject the government to potentially unwarranted additional expenses.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office no later than January 17, 2012, 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time (EST), by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov . Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered.

In accordance with FAR 6.305 and FAR 5.406, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 
BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTThe Denali National Park & Preserve Soundscape Monitoring Program requires one additional Larson Davis Model 831 sound level meter (SLM) to monitor bus noise. Currently, there are 8 identical units in the program.
FAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY FAR 13.104 and FAR 13.106-1; FAR 6.302-1
DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR IS THE ONLY SOURCE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR GOODS (I.E. UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ETC.)The Larson Davis Model 831 sound level meter is required because the sound monitoring program has a large investment in proprietary computer software that is only able to interface with these Larson Davis units. The Soundscape Monitoring Program requires units that are identical to the ones currently in use in order for them to be easily integrated into the existing field stations. BRC Engineering is the only North American distributor of this brand. 
ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  Previous purchase order (P11PX35686) awarded via sole source in September 2011 to BRC Engineering. No other interested parties at that time.
A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED  All actions have been taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition. I approve the request to conduct this acquisition using other than full and open competition.

This J&A is also available at https://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/opportunities.jsp
In accordance with FAR 6.305 and FAR 5.406, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 
BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTThe Denali National Park & Preserve Soundscape Monitoring Program requires one additional Larson Davis Model 831 sound level meter (SLM) to monitor bus noise. Currently, there are 8 identical units in the program.
FAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY FAR 13.104 and FAR 13.106-1; FAR 6.302-1
DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR IS THE ONLY SOURCE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR GOODS (I.E. UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ETC.)The Larson Davis Model 831 sound level meter is required because the sound monitoring program has a large investment in proprietary computer software that is only able to interface with these Larson Davis units. The Soundscape Monitoring Program requires units that are identical to the ones currently in use in order for them to be easily integrated into the existing field stations. BRC Engineering is the only North American distributor of this brand. 
ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  Previous purchase order (P11PX35686) awarded via sole source in September 2011 to BRC Engineering. No other interested parties at that time.
A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED  All actions have been taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition. I approve the request to conduct this acquisition using other than full and open competition.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) intends to award a sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) interim bridge contract to Six3 Systems, Inc., subsidiary of Harding Security Associates  for continued support for NGIC biometrics and theater elements.  The period of performance for the six month effort is from 29 March 2012 - 28 September 2012. This contract will provide Biometrics Intelligence Fusion Analysis and deployed Biometric Intelligence Subject Matter Expert (SME) support to deployed forces and NGIC in order to support the mission of attaining identity and denying anonymity to these adversaries. <br><br>A Solicitation W911W4-11-R-0004 was issued on 12 Jan 2011 with the intent of awarding a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) multiple award Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract.  The solicitation was cancelled on 7 Dec 2011 due to substantial changes in program funding and requirements that have occurred since it was issued. The current biometrics contract ends in 28 March 2012.  In order to provide uninterrupted services of biometrics all-source intelligence analysis services for the field, we are establishing a bridge contract.  The bridge contract will provide the us enough time to prepare a new solicitation reflecting the current status of the program.<br><br>It is not in the best interest of the Government to competitively solicit for this short-term requirement.  The solicitation preparation and evaluation would result in a duplication of effort and the required time needed for a new contractor to transition and start up would risk a break in service and the loss of a vital intelligence resource.   <br><br>The applicable NAICS code is 541690.  This sole source acquisition is in compliance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.3.02-1; Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals or quotations.   A solicitation document does not exist.  Interested persons may respond to the requirement by furnishing justification and supporting information regarding their ability as a qualified  source to provide these services to the government.<br> <br>We will consider all responses received prior to 6:00 pm est. January 26, 2012.

The Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) system is a business process to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractors report actual labor hours, dollars, and other information directly from their accounting systems directly into this system, or through their Army Requiring Activity, using their existing timekeeping, personnel, accounting systems as well as information supplied with the contract. Existing financial management and procurement systems do not completely distinguish between goods and services, nor do they identify the specific organization for which the work is being performed. CMR will enable the Army to (1) fully understand the composition of the Army workforce - military, civilian, and contractor, and allow for more informed workforce staffing and funding decisions; and (2) provide better oversight of our workforce, avoid duplication of effort, or shifting of in-house reductions to contract.  Contractor labor hours and associated labor costs are to be treated as proprietary information when linked to contractor name and contract number.The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contract manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for services performed on this contract.  The Contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the Mandatory Reporting System for this contract and will be formatted using the following web address:  https://contractormanpower.army.pentagon.mil
As part of its mandatory reporting contract services submission, the Contractor will also provide the estimated total cost (if any) incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.

The AMC Protest Litigation Team defends AMC Procurements against protests filed at GAO, and drafts AMC Headquarters protest decisions. The Team assists in the defense of bid protest litigation filed in Federal Courts. We also assist AMC field attorneys with protest litigation strategies and protest avoidance processes, such as Alternative Dispute Resolution. 

AMC-Level Protest ProceduresPolicy: A Protest to an AMC forum is a ?protest to the agency,? within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.Agency Protest: An agency protest may be filed with either: 
a) the Contracting Officer designated in the solicitation for resolution of protests, or, 
b) HQ, AMC at the address designated in the solicitation. The procedures below apply to the HQ, AMC-Level protest program only. 
Interested Parties: 
For the purpose of filing a HQ, AMC-Level Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQ, AMC-Level protest. Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQ, AMC-Level protest.
Election of Forum: 
After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQ, AMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQ, AMC-Level protest, the HQ, AMC-Level protest will be dismissed.
Protest Decision Authority: 
The AMC Command Counsel is designated as the HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority. In the absence of the Command Counsel, The Deputy Command Counsel is designated as the HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority.<BR><BR>Time for Filing a Protest: 
A HQ, AMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQ, AMC Office Hours are 8:00 am-- 4:30 pm Central Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 pm, Central Time on the last day on which such filing may be made.
Form of Protest: 
A HQ, AMC protest shall include the protester?s name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester.
Processing of HQ, AMC-Level Protests: 
Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQ, AMC Office of Command Counsel, ATTN: AMCCC-PL, one copy of an administrative report responsive to the protest. Reports shall be sent by facsimile, over-night mail or hand-delivered, to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days after the filing of the protest. 
The written decision will be binding on the Army Materiel Command and its contracting activities. For good cause shown, the HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within 1 working day of the decision to grant the extension.
Effect of Protest on Award and Performance: 
Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQ, AMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Director of Contracting, Office of Command Contracting, HQ, AMC, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). 
Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ, AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the Contracting Officer shall suspend performance. The Director of Contracting, Office of Command Contracting, HQ, AMC, may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that: 
1. contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or 
2. urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority.<BR><BR>Remedies: 
The HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: 
a) terminate the contract;b) re-compete the requirement;c) issue a new solicitation;d) refrain from exercising options under the contract;e) award a contract consistent with statute and regulation;f) pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2); andg) such other remedies as the HQ, AMC Protest Decision Authority determines necessary to correct a defect.

The objectives of the AMC Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program are to adopt an interdisciplinary approach to address disputes and dispute resolution, to design processes, to enable the parties to foster creative, acceptable solutions, and to produce expeditious decisions requiring fewer resources than formal litigation.
What is ADR? ADR is an inclusive term used to describe a variety of joint problem-solving processes that present options in lieu of adjudicative or adversarial methods of resolving conflict. ADR encourages the consideration of creative solutions to disputes that are unavailable in traditional dispute resolution forums. It encourages communication between the parties, and focuses on the parties' real interests, rather than on their positions or demands, enabling them to address the real concerns underlying the conflict. 
Who handles ADR? 
The Commander, AMC has designated the AMC Command Counsel as the AMC Senior Advisor for ADR, and asked that the major subordinate commanders (MSC) designate their Chief Counsel as the MSC Senior Advisor for ADR. 
Where do I find out more about ADR? 
The AMC ADR Guide: Progressive Approaches and Creative Initiatives to Meet the Litigation Challenge, is the basic primer on ADR, its principles and benefits, and includes a recitation of various AMC ADR initiatives.  You can obtain a copy at this website:  http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/ADRProgr.pdf

Partnering for Success: A Blueprint for Promoting Government-Industry Communication & Teamwork: This guide describes in detail a "Model Partnering Process" used at AMC. Replete with definitions, descriptions, and examples, this is the ultimate partnering guide!  You can obtain a copy at this website:  http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/PartneringForSuccess.pdf<BR><BR>Please submit all questions by 12:00 PM (M.S.T.) on Tuesday, 24 January 2012.<BR><BR>

<p>(4) Other Clauses, Terms &amp; Conditions:<br />52.212-5: Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order - Commercial Items (Aug 2011) (Deviation)<br />52.217-8: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />52.217-9: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />52.252-2: Clauses Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) <br />52.252-6: Authorized Deviations in Clauses (Apr 1984)<br />252.212-7001: Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (Jun 2010) (Deviation)<br />252.227-7021: Rights in Data - Existing Works (Mar 1979)</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW - READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice.<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095 <br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>(e) Questions concerning payments:</p>
<p>(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.</p>
<p>(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, Wisconsin, 53711 for the procurement of Qty, 20- BacTiter<sup>TM</sup> Glo Microbial Cell Assay, 10x100ml.<br /><br />The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Promega Corporation does not distribute this item to any other resellers; as such, Promega Corporation is the sole provider of this particular reagent. The BacTiterGlo assay from Promega consists of a proprietary reagent. This reagent has been specifically optimized for these projects. This item is critical to the assay needed to determine cell viability. NCGC cannot use a different reagent without complete re-optimization. This request is a sole source procurement required in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into this ongoing project.</p>
<p>NCGC must use the same variables in the assays to maintain integrity from the data and to achieve the desired outcomes. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay with no guarantees that the results would be similar. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325413, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br /><br />Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date, January 20,, 2012 will be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHGRI-CSB-(HG)-2012-051-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee. Response may be submitted electronically to Rashida.ferebee@nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT. THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: 

www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government. 

The following Clauses are applicable:

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely.
 It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 


(a) The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quote. 

(i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(4)  Quoting contractors shall submit sufficient technical data for products quoted for the Government to perform a technical evaluation IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(4).

Commercial catalog or technical data submitted shall be reviewed against the specifications of the individual CLINS herein.
 Only those quotes whose technical data demonstrates that proposed items meet the salient characteristics shall be given a GO rating. If the data is determined to be not technically acceptable a NO GO rating will be assigned and no further evaluation will be conducted. Failure to provide technical data will also result in a NO GO rating. 

(ii) DELIVERY SCEHDULE will be used to make a determination of how quickly the quoting contractor can deliver the fume extractor and related parts. Quotes should, therefore, provide their best delivery schedule to demonstrate they are responsive to the Governments URGENT need. 

(iii) PRICE. Contractors shall provide firm fixed unit pricing for the products quoted.

RATINGS: 

Quotes will be evaluated initially under factor (i) which represents the minimum acceptable criteria.
 
The Government will evaluate and make a determination of the overall value of each quote in terms of its potential to best satisfy the needs of the Government considering all factors. 

Factor (i) will be evaluated and a rating of GO or NO GO will be assigned based on the evaluation. 

Factor (ii) will be evaluated and a rating of GO or NO GO will be assigned based on the evaluation.  

Vendors quotes that receive a NO GO rating will not be further evaluated. Vendors quotes that receive GO ratings for Factor (i) and Factor (ii) will be further evaluated under Factor (iii).  

Relative Importance:

Factor (i): TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY is more important than Factor (ii) Delivery or Factor (iii) PRICE.
 Factor (ii): Delivery is more important than Factor (iii) PRICE. When combined, Factor (i) and (ii) are more important than Factor (iii). 


At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with quoting Contractors. Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractor best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than lowest total price if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. 



(g) A written notice of award or acceptance of an quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoting contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order, once the quoting contractor performs under the order or returns a signed (if requested) copy of the order to the Purchasing Agent.
 Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Submission of Quotation: Your quotation in response to RFQ005-12 is due January 19, 2012, 2:00 p.m. EST. The mailing address is as follows: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Acquisitions Services Division, 131 M Street, N.E., Room 4SW26D, Washington, D.C. 20507 Attn: Gregory Browne; Contracting Officer. A quotation submitted via e-mail addressed to gregory.browne@eeoc.gov with a cc: copy to joseph.pishoneri@eeoc.gov will be accepted. Questions regarding this request for quotation should be submitted to Gregory Browne, via e-mail at gregory.browne@eeoc.gov. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. The deadline for submission of questions regarding RFQ005-12 is January 13, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EST. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before February 9, 2012.</p>
<p>Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>Factor 1-Technical Capability: a. Contract Requirements: Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to: 1. Provide all of the contract requirements regarding meeting space, food and beverage service, audio visual equipment and technical support. 2. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to the meeting space. 3. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.</p>
<p>b. Location: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located in Washington, DC with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, from nearby hotels, and from the local commuting area. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the facility and the surrounding area. <br />c. Availability of Dates: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: (a). The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past threee (3) years. Contact information should include the following: Name and address of government agency or other non-government client; Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable; contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and description of services provided. List any problems encountered on each contract and the quoter's corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary). (b). In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Huntington District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for copper service wire to be delivered to John W. Flannagan Dam in Haysi, VA.  Please see the attached solicitation.  This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses.  <br><br>If the vendors are experiencing certificate problems provide them with the following:<br><br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).  ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may have noticed an IE alert stating our ASFI root certificate was not issued by a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when accessing the ASFI website. <br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested.  Solicitation Number:  D12PS51005This solicitation is issued as request for proposal (RFP).
The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-54, effective December 2, 2011.
This solicitation is for full and open competition.  This is NOT set-aside.  The Government anticipates that the majority of this effort may be performed under NAICS code 621511, Medical Laboratories.  The size standard for this code is $13,500,000.00.

This requirement is intended to cover any future alternative specimens which may be approved by the regulatory bodies and/or requested by the Agencies.

<DESC>Modification ONe (1) is hereby issued to change the FAR Part from FAR Subpart 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items)&nbsp;to FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items)&nbsp;due the expiration of&nbsp;use of authority.&nbsp;The announcement is being extended until January 13, 2012. Submissions will be due via email by&nbsp;12noon on January 13, 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&nbsp;Part 12, Commercial Items.&nbsp;The NAICS Code is 511210. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Consona CRM, Inc., 450 E. 96th St., Suite 300, Indianapolis, IN 46240-3797, to acquire a 12-month renewal of software and maintenance support for CIT's licensed KNOVA&reg; software products as required to support the NIH Service Desk. CIT previously selected KNOVA brand name software in 2004 for the initial design and installation to support the NIH Service Desk. KNOVA has provided infrastructure maintenance support to the NIH Service Desk since that date. KNOVA software is currently integrated into the NIH Service Desk's Remedy problem-tracking system and is used directly by the NIH Service Desk staff and other NIH technical support infrastructure components. In 2007, CIT acquired the upgrade, installation and deployment of KNOVA 7.2 to enable the NIH Service Desk to complete its transition to a service desk utilizing ITIL to assimilate the other components required to complete the service desk model. In addition to enhanced functionality, the upgrade to KNOVA 7.2 provides CIT with a Return on Investment (ROI). The acquisition of KNOVA 7.2 in 2007 was a major upgrade from the previous KNOVA Version 5.0 by providing the following enhancements: Successful deployment of KNOVA 7.2 live in the NIH environment, including installation; KNOVA Contact Center for Internal Users; and Configuration of Authoring Workflow and Document, Template and External Content Integration. KNOVA 7.2 is a top-rated product suite delivered on a powerful, adaptive NLP Search and Knowledge Management Platform. KNOVA 7.2 provides an intuitive toolset that allows the NIH Service Desk to affect the customer experience in a far more granular manner. KNOVA 7.2 features a patented self-learning search technology that enables users to access the best answers quickly. Service desk agents simply enter questions or issues in the customer's own words (supporting the Federal Government's Plain Language Initiative), and KNOVA Knowledge Desk informs them of the resolution options with the highest probability of success. Critically, this patented self-learning search and Knowledge Management engine - called the Cognitive Processor&reg; - continuously learns and improves with each transaction. KNOVA 7.2 provides a more proactive approach to managing the customer help desk experience than the traditional focus on service resolution management. The features included in KNOVA 7.2 also support collaboration across NIH Institutes/Centers. Since KNOVA engineered the existing software used by the NIH Service Desk, no other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product could effectively map to the existing data. Furthermore, the KNOVA 7.2 user interface supports Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. &sect; 794d). CIT has determined that KNOVA 7.2 brand name software and support is the only COTS product that can provide the enhanced software functions required by the NIH Service Desk. Consona is the only source for KNOVA software support with no authorized re-sellers. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12,&nbsp;Commercial Items. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact&nbsp;by the due date and time listed under modification section.&nbsp;NLM Synopsis No. 12-276-CYC shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Cara Calimano at CalimaC@mail.nlm.nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Cara Calimano, (301) 496 6546; Fax 301 402-0642.

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this request for quotes.<BR><BR>Inquiries, questions, and all correspondence concerning this solicitation document should be submitted via FedBid, referencing USHMM RFQ-9531-12-R-0500.  No verbal modifications will be considered.  All questions must reference specific parts of the solicitation including page numbers and will only be received until Thursday, January 5th, 2012, at 11:00 AM ET.  Replies will be made in writing, and distributed to all vendors via FedBid posting.<BR><BR>Offerors shall propose an itemized payment schedule which ties reasonable, performance-related progress payments to Museum-accepted delivery of goods and services, while withholding a 10% retainage of the total project price pending satisfactory completion of contract performance.  Contractor warrants that the prices for the supplies and services under this Contract are not greater than the prices charged the Contractor's most favorable customer under similar circumstances.<BR><BR>Q: I just wanted to confirm if the end user is open for the Oracle Linux support which is a copy of Red Hat Linux?
A: The RFQ is "exact match" because it is USHMM's Red Hat Linux software license & support relationship for which we are seeking renewal. By reposting as "brand name or equal" USHMM places prospective offerors on notice that bidding goods and services other than but effectively identical to those for which we are seeking quotes shall carry the additional burden of establishing that identity to the satisfaction of our technical team, by separate non-pricing writing accompanying the FedBid submission to bfalk@ushmm.org. Bottom line, any offeror whose quote demonstrates (and represents, warrants, and certifies) that their offering is an "exact match" will receive good faith consideration. (Offerors are permitted to submit multiple quotes for different products, subject to the proviso above.)<BR><BR>To be considered for award, all Sellers must be manufacturer federally authorized distributors and/or resellers of the equipment/services they are offering with a demonstrated capability of delivering the entire order within the timeframes specified by the Buyer on the award. Sellers will be required to provide documentation as proof of authorization to be considered for award.  Please send this documentation to FedBid?s client services team (clientservices@fedbid.com) prior to the close of this Buy.<BR><BR>

<DESC>General Information :<br />Document Type: Request for Information (RFI)<br />Solicitation Number: <br />Posted Date: 10 Jan 12<br />Response Date: 27 Jan 12<br />Classification Code:<br />Fifth Wheel Assembly &amp; Manufacturing
<p>NAICS: 336211 Fifth Wheel Assemblies Manufacturing <br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of the Air Force <br />Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center<br />AFNWC/PKMA <br />6014 Dogwood Ave (Bldg 1258, rm 25)<br />Hill AFB, UT, 84056-5825<br />Special Considerations:<br />Contract award decision may be based upon an evaluation of cost and non-cost factors (i.e., technical capability, past performance, etc.).</p>
<p>TERP OVERVIEW:<br />The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Systems Directorate (ICBM/SD) is competing a contract to replace the Transporter Erector (TE). The TE is the sole vehicle used for transporting; emplacing and removing the Minuteman III (MM III) ICBM booster at various remote launch facilities across the continental United States and is considered a vital piece of support equipment to the ICBM weapon system. The currently fielded TE was the replacement to the original TE that was fielded in 1957 with the original Minuteman I ICBM system and was fielded in 1988. The warfighter (Air Force Global Strike Command) requires an obsolescent free replacement for the TE that will sustain ICBM handling operations through 2030.</p>
<p>The changing nuclear security environment has placed an exceptional burden on the TE design, fleet wide. MMIII booster maintenance and replacement programs are expected to continue which will cause the TE usage rates to increase over the intended service life. The acquisition of the TE replacement will be completed in two phases:<br />Phase 1 (Engineering Manufacturing and Development) : Contractor responsibilities will include tasks associated with engineering, program management, and testing such that modifications or changes to Government Furnished specifications, drawings, Technical Orders and manuals will not negatively impact TE performance parameters. The estimated number of drawings and specifications that will need to be updated is ~ 5500 documents. Parameters to be measured will reflect the adequacy of system level readiness and will include agreed upon measures of "Reliability", "Delivery", "Producability", and "Sustainability". Two "First Article" TEs will be fabricated to updated specifications. The "First Articles" will be used in agreed upon qualification testing of the TE. Upon completion of qualification testing and report, contractor will deliver full updated data package with applicable data rights to the government for approval.<br />Phase 2 (Production): Contractor responsibilities will include tasks associated with engineering support, program management and fabrication of 22 TEs by the end of FY18. Parameters to be measured will reflect the adequacy of system level readiness and will include an agreed upon measure of "Delivery". Ability to accelerate production to as many as 10 TEs per calendar year is desired. Additionally, an option to produce 4 additional TEs (production total of 26) maybe required, but will be decided upon at a later date.</p>
<p>This RFI contains the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the TE Replacement Program (TERP) and is being used as additional market research for the program as described above. Interested parties are encouraged to provide comments/feedback on the details of the DRAFT RFP as described here-in. Once the RFP is formally released, it will be non-negotiable. At a minimum, the government would like the following to be addressed in the response:</p>
<p>1. Has enough information been provided for potential offerors to accurately scope the TERP effort? If not, please suggest additional detail that you think is required scope the effort.<br />2. Is the evaluation criteria and evaluation factors described in sections L and M respectively understood? Please provide suggestions for enhanced clarity?<br />3. Is the Contract Line Item structure in Section B clear? Provide suggestions to clarify as appropriate.<br />4. Provide comments on the Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type selected. Please describe any potential risks with this contract type across the program effort? Does this contract type provide the appropriate amount of flexibility to support the TERP requirements? Provide feedback on the share ratios and the government set ceiling described in Section L. <br />5. Are the proposal page count limitations imposed in Section L appropriate? If insufficient, propose a new limit.<br />6. Is a 28 calendar day proposal preparation time sufficient to address all requirements for this solicitation? <br />Pre-Solicitation Conference Announcement:<br />The ICBM/SD intends to provide an opportunity for potential offerors to request a ninety (90) minute one-on-one session with the Government to discuss questions and provide feedback on the draft RFP.

<p><br />**AMENDMENT 0001 ISSUED 20 MAY 11**<br /><br /><br /><br />All questions regarding this notice are to be submitted in writing via E-mail or Fax.</p>
<p><br />Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>Q) In T.O. 6J15-13-11-3, the note under Chapter 8.1 references a hydraulic motor which is to be removed from the fuel flow proportioner (pump) prior to servicing and testing of the proportioner. My question is whether or not this hydraulic motor (governed by TO 6J15-13-12-3) is required to be included in the workscope for the subject solicitation.</p>
<p>A) Only NSN 2915-01-147-2644RK is to be overhauled/remanufactured on this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) If we are not to overhaul the motor and the motor is not operational we are not required to replace the motor or fix the motor as part of the scope of work?</p>
<p>A)&nbsp; The Motor, hydraulic should&nbsp;be removed before the Pump, Fuel, Metering is shipped for overhual/remanufacture.&nbsp; However, if Pump, Fuel,Metering (2915-01-147-2644RK) is received with Motor, Hydraulic (1650-01-568-1044), contractor shall remove Motor, Hydraulic and request disposition instructions from Production Management Specialist. "IAW the SDR process in the PWS". This language will be incorporated into the PWS via solicitation amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) Pertaining to the solicitation/contract, the Bidder/Offeror is required to complete blocks 11, 13, 15, 21, 22, &amp; 27. In the same block that lists these requirements, there is a letter "J" provided. To what does this pertain? Section "J"?</p>
<p>A) The letter J in this block (located at the top of page 1) indicates the pricing type. In this instance, the pricing type is Firm-Fixed-Priced.</p>
<p><br />Q) Also pertaining to the solicitation/contract, in Section B are Items 0002 and 0003 to be negotiated after contract award based on Items 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Item 0003, Data, is Not Separately Priced (NSP). Any costs associated with this item should be included in item 0001. Item 0002, Over and Above, will be negotiated on an as needed basis after award.</p>
<p><br />Q) Do discounts for prompt payment need to be addressed in this bid due May 23, at 4PM or is this an item that will be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) The prompt payment discount should be included in&nbsp;the offer. See FAR clauses 52.232-8 and 52.232-25 for additional details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) The "Total Evaluated Price" is defined on page 35 of 35 of the solicitation as including the "basic requirement (item 0001AA) and all options (items 0001AB and AC) plus other associated factors such as: first article testing cost, transportation cost, price evaluation adjustments for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, and application of labor hours to labor hour rates, etc." Do all of these "other associated factors" need to be addressed in the bid which is due May 23 at 4PM or will they be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) Any applicable "other associated factors" should be included in&nbsp;the offer since they are a part of the price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Q) On the solicitation contract in block 13, a contractor offeror code and a facility code are requested. What are these and where might we obtain them?</p>
<p>A) The contractor offeror code is the cage code of the specific offeror responding to the solicitation. The facility code is only required if the actual work is to be performed at a facility other than the one associated with the offeror code. Your cage code can be found at http://bpn.gov/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does "Other than high value item" mean in regards to Limitation of Liability?</p>
<p>A) This indicates the applicable Limitation of Liability FAR clause for that item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does PACRN and PAA mean?</p>
<p>A) PACRN is a Packaging Reference Number. The PACRN is a 3-position code that identifies the packaging information for a specific line item or delivery item (i.e. PAA). The PACRN will cross reference the applicability in the Line Item Schedule to the packaging clauses (for example see section D, Packaging and Marking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) During overhaul/remanufacture of a subject Fuel Flow Proportioner, please confirm the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC and up to the BER threshold of 75% of the stock price.</p>
<p>If a unit's remanufacture/overhaul cost exceeds the BER threshold (75% of stock price), is the contractor required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Both the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation discuss what to do in the event an item is considered BER. Additionally, regardless of whether an item is BER or not, the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price unless Over and Above is deemed to be acceptable. See the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation for additional details on Over and Above work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In block 5 of the Solicitation/Contract, the Solicitation Type is listed as "Negotiated." Other than submittal of the signed Solicitation/Contract and all other required documents, will an opportunity for discussion be provided prior to contract award?</p>
<p>A) Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award address discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In TO 6J15-13-11-3 in the Introduction Section page iii/iv under paragraph 4. Repair Kits., the first two sentences read "Some repair parts for the component covered in this manual are provided in the form of a kit. The Illustrated Parts Breakdown identifies these parts." However, we have not found an itemization of the parts contained within the kit is listed by PN 81503-1 in the MPL, but no further identification is provided. Please provide the components of this kit.</p>
<p>A) This parts list can be requested.&nbsp; Please follow the same procedures as if requesting a T.O.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) [It was previously] indicated that only the proportioner NSN 2915-01-147-2644 is to be overhauled by this solicitation and not the hydraulic motor or, as I understand it, the assembly PN 60957. To this end, what other and/or attaching parts need not be addressed in the overhaul of the proportioner? As an example, the solicitation requires 100% replacement of, among other parts, Figure 10 &amp; Index 3, PN M25988/1-135 packing, but this packing is at the same indentation level as the proportioner itself. In other words, if we are to receive, overhaul, and test only the proportioner (utilizing a slave hydraulic motor), we will not be able to install this packing since it goes between the proportioner and hydraulic motor.</p>
<p>A) T.O. 33DA36-88-1 Operation and Maintenance Instructions; Fuel Flow Proportioner Test Stand, has the requirements to test the Proportioner. The O ring can be changed as per T.O. 33DA36-88-1. (i.e. Put a new O ring on when you put the Fuel Flow Proportioner on the slave hydraulic motor.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) Is the stock list price of $13,123.08, listed in Item No. 0001, the government price for a new proportioner?</p>
<p>A) The stock list price (SLP) is the price we have on record for what a new proportioner would cost. See page 3of the solicitation for additional information regarding the SLP.</p>

<p><br />**AMENDMENT 0001 ISSUED 20 MAY 11**<br />**AMENDMENT 0002 ISSUED 31 MAY 11**<br /><br /><br /><br />All questions regarding this notice are to be submitted in writing via E-mail or Fax.</p>
<p><br />Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>Q) In T.O. 6J15-13-11-3, the note under Chapter 8.1 references a hydraulic motor which is to be removed from the fuel flow proportioner (pump) prior to servicing and testing of the proportioner. My question is whether or not this hydraulic motor (governed by TO 6J15-13-12-3) is required to be included in the workscope for the subject solicitation.</p>
<p>A) Only NSN 2915-01-147-2644RK is to be overhauled/remanufactured on this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) If we are not to overhaul the motor and the motor is not operational we are not required to replace the motor or fix the motor as part of the scope of work?</p>
<p>A)&nbsp; The Motor, hydraulic should&nbsp;be removed before the Pump, Fuel, Metering is shipped for overhual/remanufacture.&nbsp; However, if Pump, Fuel,Metering (2915-01-147-2644RK) is received with Motor, Hydraulic (1650-01-568-1044), contractor shall remove Motor, Hydraulic and request disposition instructions from Production Management Specialist. "IAW the SDR process in the PWS". This language will be incorporated into the PWS via solicitation amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) Pertaining to the solicitation/contract, the Bidder/Offeror is required to complete blocks 11, 13, 15, 21, 22, &amp; 27. In the same block that lists these requirements, there is a letter "J" provided. To what does this pertain? Section "J"?</p>
<p>A) The letter J in this block (located at the top of page 1) indicates the pricing type. In this instance, the pricing type is Firm-Fixed-Priced.</p>
<p><br />Q) Also pertaining to the solicitation/contract, in Section B are Items 0002 and 0003 to be negotiated after contract award based on Items 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Item 0003, Data, is Not Separately Priced (NSP). Any costs associated with this item should be included in item 0001. Item 0002, Over and Above, will be negotiated on an as needed basis after award.</p>
<p><br />Q) Do discounts for prompt payment need to be addressed in this bid due May 23, at 4PM or is this an item that will be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) The prompt payment discount should be included in&nbsp;the offer. See FAR clauses 52.232-8 and 52.232-25 for additional details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) The "Total Evaluated Price" is defined on page 35 of 35 of the solicitation as including the "basic requirement (item 0001AA) and all options (items 0001AB and AC) plus other associated factors such as: first article testing cost, transportation cost, price evaluation adjustments for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, and application of labor hours to labor hour rates, etc." Do all of these "other associated factors" need to be addressed in the bid which is due May 23 at 4PM or will they be negotiated at a later date?</p>
<p>A) Any applicable "other associated factors" should be included in&nbsp;the offer since they are a part of the price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Q) On the solicitation contract in block 13, a contractor offeror code and a facility code are requested. What are these and where might we obtain them?</p>
<p>A) The contractor offeror code is the cage code of the specific offeror responding to the solicitation. The facility code is only required if the actual work is to be performed at a facility other than the one associated with the offeror code. Your cage code can be found at http://bpn.gov/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does "Other than high value item" mean in regards to Limitation of Liability?</p>
<p>A) This indicates the applicable Limitation of Liability FAR clause for that item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In Section B Item No. 0001 what does PACRN and PAA mean?</p>
<p>A) PACRN is a Packaging Reference Number. The PACRN is a 3-position code that identifies the packaging information for a specific line item or delivery item (i.e. PAA). The PACRN will cross reference the applicability in the Line Item Schedule to the packaging clauses (for example see section D, Packaging and Marking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) During overhaul/remanufacture of a subject Fuel Flow Proportioner, please confirm the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC and up to the BER threshold of 75% of the stock price.</p>
<p>If a unit's remanufacture/overhaul cost exceeds the BER threshold (75% of stock price), is the contractor required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price given for Item Nos. 0001AA, 0001AB, and 0001AC?</p>
<p>A) Both the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation discuss what to do in the event an item is considered BER. Additionally, regardless of whether an item is BER or not, the contractor is required to cover all costs incurred above their fixed price unless Over and Above is deemed to be acceptable. See the Appendix A/PWS and solicitation for additional details on Over and Above work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In block 5 of the Solicitation/Contract, the Solicitation Type is listed as "Negotiated." Other than submittal of the signed Solicitation/Contract and all other required documents, will an opportunity for discussion be provided prior to contract award?</p>
<p>A) Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award address discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q) In TO 6J15-13-11-3 in the Introduction Section page iii/iv under paragraph 4. Repair Kits., the first two sentences read "Some repair parts for the component covered in this manual are provided in the form of a kit. The Illustrated Parts Breakdown identifies these parts." However, we have not found an itemization of the parts contained within the kit is listed by PN 81503-1 in the MPL, but no further identification is provided. Please provide the components of this kit.</p>
<p>A) This parts list can be requested.&nbsp; Please follow the same procedures as if requesting a T.O.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) [It was previously] indicated that only the proportioner NSN 2915-01-147-2644 is to be overhauled by this solicitation and not the hydraulic motor or, as I understand it, the assembly PN 60957. To this end, what other and/or attaching parts need not be addressed in the overhaul of the proportioner? As an example, the solicitation requires 100% replacement of, among other parts, Figure 10 &amp; Index 3, PN M25988/1-135 packing, but this packing is at the same indentation level as the proportioner itself. In other words, if we are to receive, overhaul, and test only the proportioner (utilizing a slave hydraulic motor), we will not be able to install this packing since it goes between the proportioner and hydraulic motor.</p>
<p>A) T.O. 33DA36-88-1 Operation and Maintenance Instructions; Fuel Flow Proportioner Test Stand, has the requirements to test the Proportioner. The O ring can be changed as per T.O. 33DA36-88-1. (i.e. Put a new O ring on when you put the Fuel Flow Proportioner on the slave hydraulic motor.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q) Is the stock list price of $13,123.08, listed in Item No. 0001, the government price for a new proportioner?</p>
<p>A) The stock list price (SLP) is the price we have on record for what a new proportioner would cost. See page 3of the solicitation for additional information regarding the SLP.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Line of Business has a requirement for ISO 9001:2008 registrar support services.  Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is also deeply involved in the Agencies implementation of a Safety Management System (SMS) and the Next-Generation (NEXTGEN) air traffic control systems.  The AVS organization is composed of over 7000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes.  Having completed two (2) three-year cycles of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete another recertification audit and surveillance audits to sustain the certificate.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits.  The current contractor is ABS Quality Evaluation Inc, 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77060 under Contract No. DTFAWA-10-C-00031 which ends 04/01/2012.
The purpose of this survey is to gather information in order to determine whether there is adequate competition among small businesses and to choose the procurement method for this requirement.  If adequate competition is determined to exist among small businesses then the FAA may determine to set aside the requirement for competition among small businesses, if this cannot be determined based on the response to this market survey then the requirement will be open to all business sizes.  All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Katherine M. Williams at katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.  Please see the attached market survey announcement and statement of work for more details.  Responses are due by 10am January 19, 2012 to katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.

<DESC>The USAMRAA contracting office is requesting information from industry to determine if set-aside capabilities exist versus unrestricted competition for support services to the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM).  As part of the market research required for support services, the Government is seeking interested contractor sources that can perform the same or similar support categories.  Contractors are encouraged to indicate if the labor categories are available as other than professional services with industry in order to comply with Service Contract Act requirements. <br><br>The support services provided under this effort have been performed by ARP for the past 15 years through a cost reimbursement, sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) and 10 U.S.C. 176(b)(1)(C), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  The authority expired in September 2011 due to the disestablishment of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  BRAC Law 2005 directed the relocation of NMHM from Walter Reed to Forest Glen Annex, Silver Spring, MD.  A competitive requirement for museum support services in now being planned with set-aside or unrestricted procurement procedures depending upon industry input for sources available.<br>

The small business prime must be capable of self performing atleast 51 percent of the work.
The firm must be capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning and design of a clinical consolidation and realignment in the Lexington, KY area.
Probable Scope:

In order to meet the Medical Center's initial assessment of parking needs, two (2) garages will be integral to this project.  Each of the garages will be new 900-space (approximately) multi-level parking structures, constructed adjacent to the new facility being designed.  Further, surface parking lots with a capacity of 700 spaces (approximately) will be required as part of this project.  

Approximately nine (9) existing buildings totaling about 48,000 GSF will be demolished to provide usable ground on the southeast portion of the campus for the new building and parking structures. 

Once a thorough analysis of the Medical Center's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.

Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and VA Program Guide PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.  

The contract will include a government option for: design-build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits.

The completed project should be capable of achieving LEED Silver and/or GBI Green Globes certification.  

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed, with additional experience with vertical expansion/integration along with phasing of on-going operations will be considered.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the firm's, or teams', Quality Assurance /Quality Control procedures.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  
In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.
Applicants must have an established working office within 100 mile radius of Lexington, Kentucky, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Kentucky.
