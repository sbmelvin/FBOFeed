<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for thirty vials of frozen induced pluripotent stem cells each with at least 4.5 million frozen viable human cardiomyocyte cells.  NASA ARC has determined that Cellular Dynamic International (CDI) is the only vendor who can provide this requirement.  Since mid-2013 NASAs Bioculture System Project science team has been performing all of the laboratory testing and development for culturing human iCell cardiomyocyte cells during an extended period of time in space.	CDIs iCardiomyocyte product is unique because it is well characterized and used extensively by the pharma industry in modeling human heart disease in drug testing.  NASA ARC intends to purchase the requirement from Cellular Dynamic International on a sole source basis.  Since the cell line viability and characteristics vary from vendor to vendor, and lot to lot, it is a science requirement to purchase cells from the same vendor and the same lot that has already been tested by the Bioculture System Project science team in order to achieve consistent results during Mission Verification Tests and Spaceflight.  In accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1), Cellular Dynamic International is the only one source reasonably available, and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 3, 2014.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>      .

<DESC>// NSN(s): 4810-01-397-6654<br />// Item Description: Body, Valve<br />// Manufacturer's Code and Part Number (if applicable):<br />CAGE 45934 / P/N 83566<br />// Quantity (including option quantity): 75<br />// Unit of Issue: EA<br />// Destination Information: FOB Origin / I&amp;A Destination<br />// Delivery Schedule: 450 days
<p>12. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>26. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>(X) The solicitation will be available in DLA DIBBS (https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp) on its issue date of 03/04/2014.</p>
<p>(X) This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: Ontic Engineering and Manufacturing / CAGE 45934.</p>
<p>(X) Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>(X) While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(X) Various Increments Solicited:<br />FROM: 25 TO: 49<br />FROM: 50 TO: 74<br />FROM: 75 TO: 100</p>
<p>(X) The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(X) TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: UNRESTRICTED</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement to complete the Execution Planning and Accomplishment of the Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) for the USS MAHAN (DDG 72) home-ported in Norfolk, VA. The period of performance of the contemplated Execution Planning will be from February 2014 until February 2015, and the Accomplishment of the CNO Scheduled USS MAHAN (DDG 72) DSRA will be from February 2015 until July 2015. The Execution Planning requirements include performance of Production Engineering Support, Production Planning, Procurement, Manning &amp; Production Analysis, and Production Work Integration necessary to prepare for the CNO Availability. Accomplishing the DSRA requirement includes all the necessary management, technical analysis, procurement, production, testing and quality assurance necessary to prepare for and accomplish the repair and alteration of the USS Mahan (DDG 72).
<p>To fulfill the agency's requirements, this effort will be procured, without full and open competition, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) from the only qualified source capable of performing the work without unacceptable delays. NAVSEA intends to issue a solicitation to BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair (BAE), 750 West Berkley Avenue, Norfolk, VA for procurement of the Execution Planning and Accomplishment under the existing DDG-51 Class Docking Multi-Ship, Multi-Option (MSMO) contract N00024-10-C-4308. As the holder of the DDG-51 Docking MSMO contact, BAE is currently the sole provider of execution planning and accomplishment for DDG 51 Docking Availabilities in the Norfolk, VA homeport. The Government intends to increase the scope and extend the period of performance under the current Multi-Ship, Multi-Option (MSMO) contract N00024-10-C-4308 with BAE by revising the existing TBD Execution Planning and Accomplishment CLINs from planning and accomplishing a TBD Selected Restricted Availability to planning and accomplishing the DDG 72 Docking Selected Restricted Availability. Thus, the scope increase is limited and does not add work of a nature that is beyond what was originally solicited under the DDG-51 Docking MSMO contract N00024-10-C-4308. The latest option exercise date for accomplishment will be extended from 30 September 2014 to the start of the availability, which is expected to commence on 16 February 2015.</p>
<p>Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact BAE directly.</p>

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-12-G-JQ66. The BOA was issued to Raytheon Company, McKinney, TX. Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. As a result of this JO the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-12-G-JQ66 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This JO is anticipated to procure maintenance/repair, engineering/logistics analyses, reliability efforts, maintainability efforts, sparing/provisioning support, configuration management, technical support, field support and test equipment support (hardware and software) for MTS.</p>

<DESC><p>Planned sole source follow-on contract to conduct the fourth phase of a public survey effort to assess and quantify flood-induced damages in the Chicago Metro Area from the record-setting rainfall event that occurred in April 2013, Cook County, IL.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to its incumbent Contractor, Survey Center LLC, to continue conducting public surveys in the Chicago Region to identify structural damages resulting from flooding in April 2013. The first three phases have previously been contracted to Survey Center, LLC. <br /><br />Survey Center has tremendous experience conducting public surveying and marketing initiatives for both governmental and non-governmental clients and has a strong working relationship with the Chicago District. Through the previous Task Orders, Survey Center has gained the necessary institutional knowledge of the April 2013 Post Flood Damage Survey effort and the Government has already made a substantial investment with the firm in developing the upfront surveying methodologies and procedures. By utilizing the same contractor for all phases of the effort, the Government can be assumed of a uniform and consistent product for all four phases of the public surveying effort. For the purposes of continuity, efficiency, quality control, and cost effectiveness, the Government seeks to complete the final phase of this surveying effort through a contract with Survey Center.<br /><br />In consideration of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(a) and (b), the services being planned are available from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services as it is likely that an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and potentially cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling of the agency's requirements for these surveys.<br /><br />Please submit your interest in response to this Notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform these requirements. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. The government does not intend to pay for information received. All interested parties must respond within 15 days from the date of this notice. Written responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating your firm's capability to provide the required services. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to FBO announcement W912P6-14-Q-0015. If no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement by 4:30 p.m. CDT on&nbsp;01 March&nbsp;2014, the Chicago District will negotiate solely with Survey Center for the aforementioned services. This point of contact is Kim M. Beard at (312) 846-5378.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 575-14-828S - Eliminate Domestic Water Dead End Lines at the Grand Junction VA Medical Center (VAMC), Grand Junction, CO.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

This contract will provide for the investigation, development, design and contract documents which include construction drawings and specifications for upgrading the existing domestic hot and cold water piping systems of Building 1.  The intent of this scope is to eliminate piping that is nonfunctional, determine points of cross connection, remove/replace galvanized piping and improve efficiency of the hot water recirculation system.  
History:  The existing piping for domestic water in Building 1 is comprised of aged copper pipe, new copper pipe and original galvanized pipe.  Demolition during previous construction has revealed asbestos pipe insulation in plumbing walls and on supply risers.  Valves throughout the systems have failed, creating maintenance and repair issues.  Current monitoring and testing of domestic water has indicated presence of Legionella.  The contract shall provide for the following critical needs: 

1.	Provide for a systematic survey of domestic water piping throughout floors 1, 2 3, 4, 5 and 6 of all wings of Building 1.  The survey shall include but not be limited to proximity of hot water use points to recirculation terminal loops, supply riser loads and non-functional piping runs.  Survey shall identify asbestos insulation.
2.	Provide for asbestos and abatement in accordance with Colorado Regulation 8 and the GJVAMC Asbestos Survey Report.  Specifications shall provide detailed directions and guidance to the contractor on abatement procedures. 
3.	Utilizing the survey data, provide for a design that addresses revision, removal or replacement of piping. 
4.	Upon approval by Medical Center review of the 100% drawings and specifications, the contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer publishable construction drawings and specifications (PDF format).

ENERGY DESIGN ANALYSIS: not required for this contract.

The estimated project cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.  Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.  Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 75% design submission, and a 100% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. Interested firms should submit one (1) copy of their current SF 330 no later than 12:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) March 3, 2014 to andrew.stigen@va.gov. The emailed file shall not exceed 5MB in total.  

Offerors will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of reagents and consumables for the Argus Optical Mapping System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516. Size standard is 500 employees. <br />The proposed source is OpGen Inc.; 708 Quince Orchard Rd.; Gaithersburg, MD 20878. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the consumables and reagents for use with an Argus Optical Mapping System. OpGen is the only manufacturer of the Argus Optical Mapping System. No other company has the technology available to provide the system nor the reagents used to test on the system. A sources sought was performed and only OpGen submitted a capabilities package. Internet searches resulted in no other source for the reagents that would work with this instrument. Currently, there are no other companies/vendors that sell the same technology and reagents as OpGen. An in-depth online market search was conducted to identify other vendors that can supply and service the Argus Optical Mapping System. As a result of this online search, no other vendors were found. Using different reagents and consumables would require replacement of the Argus Optical Mapping System instrument and a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e.) This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted and the Government will not reimburse respondents for preparation of the response. <br>  <br> The Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) Joint Project Management Office (JPMO), under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is the DoD organization responsible for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment, prophylactic, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare agents. The current MCS portfolio includes therapeutics, pretreatments, prophylactics, and diagnostics at varying stages of advancement and clinical development, including drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). <br>  <br> MCS is seeking information/input on suggested strategies/processes in which the current approach (to include licensure strategy, solicitation process, use of small businesses, contract and program management approaches), as detailed below, can be modified/improved to attract a broader audience of potential offerors/ subcontractors.  <br>  <br> The current MCS licensure strategy extends from early development through the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission whereby the Government acts as an integrator.  After IND submission and extending through FDA licensure, the Government seeks a contractor competitively (unless other than full and open competition has been approved) to serve as the integrator (a prime contractor).  As the integrator, the prime contractor, acts as sponsor and works collaboratively with the Government in all interactions with FDA.  Contracted quantities are limited to the needs of the warfighters for the specific product.  The MCS preference is for unencumbered technology. <br>  <br> The current solicitation process uses Best Value Criteria.  Currently, the solicitation requires offerors to submit five (5) proposal volumes (Technical, Past Performance, Administrative, Small Business Participation, and Price/Cost).  The technical volume addresses Product Profile, Technical Approach, and Program Management.  MCS typically allows 45-60 days after issuance for offerors to submit a proposal.  Contract awards usually occur six (6) to nine (9) months after initial proposal receipt. <br>  <br> Contracts can require delivery of FDA approved/licensed products based upon needs of the warfighter, use of the Animal Rule, and complexity of the end product among other things.  The portion of the contracts requiring development and licensure of the end product are cost-plus line items requiring offerors have an approved accounting system, while portions of the contracts requiring delivery of initial procurement quantities are Firm Fixed-Price.  Contracts also require various data deliverables including, but not limited to:  Integrated Master Schedule, Contract Work Breakdown Structure, Technical Data Package, and Drug Master File. <br>  <br> The Government oversees and/or monitors contractor performance under its contracts by using personnel and methods such as Integrated Product Teams, Earned Value Management Systems, Contracting Officer Representatives and operational and scientific reports. <br>  <br> Information from interested parties is requested to assist the Government in attracting a broader audience of potential offerors/ subcontractors. Specifically, if a different approach was used by the Government in its solicitations and contracts to develop FDA licensed products, what changes in the above would be necessary for your company to be interested in working with the Government. <br>  <br>  <br> Respondents may submit questions regarding this RFI or request a meeting through the Point of Contact listed below.  All meeting requests may not be granted. <br>  <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  <br>  <br> All written responses must be received within seventeen (17) days of issuance of this RFI. Submissions should: (1) use Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf); (2) be sent to Leo Fratis;(3) be minimum 11 point font on 8.5 quote mark  X 11 quote mark  paper; (4) be complete, sufficiently detailed, and organized in a manner that is responsive to the information requested in this RFI; (5) include a single company point of contact with name, title, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address(es); and (6) not to exceed 10 single-sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter). Other media types (i.e., CD, printed technical information) that meet the submission criteria above will be accepted and should be sent to the Contracting Office Address and Point of Contact identified below. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired.  <br>  <br> In addition to the above, please indicate your company's willingness to be added to a database of vendors to be published for the purposes of sharing with other vendors with interests specific to medical countermeasure type work. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> US Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Grounds Natick Division ATTN: Leo Fratis, 1564 Freedman Dr, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702  <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> Questions and submissions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to leo.j.fratis.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO HP ENTERPRISE SERVICES LLC (HPES), 13600 EDS DRIVE, HERNDON, VA, 20171
<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for national policy and programs that address America's housing needs, improve and develop the nation's communities, and enforce fair housing laws. These statutory responsibilities encompass community planning and development; housing mortgage insurance and subsidy programs; fair housing and equal opportunity in HUD-assisted programs; access to housing for people with disabilities; the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or "Ginnie Mae") guarantee programs; and policy development and research on national housing issues. To achieve its mission, HUD has 23 program offices and 80 field offices that are currently supported by IT infrastructure systems and services provided by the HUD Information Technology Services (HITS) managed services contracts.</p>
<p>Description of Services: <br />HPES currently provides information technology services in support of HUD's infrastructure nationwide. The contractor provides approximately 176 applications, providing more than 450 Terabytes of data storage, disaster Recovery for 35 applications and wireless services to more than 1600 mobile devices. The following is a list of services that are provided by HPES in support of HUD's infrastructure:<br /><br />Item Service Description<br />1 Hardware<br />2 Software Support<br />3 Database Management<br />4 Enterprise Engineering<br />5 Telecommunications<br />6 Wireless and Mobile Communications<br />7 Performance Modeling<br />8 Technology Assessment<br />9 Help Desk<br />10 System Acceptance<br />11 Disaster Recovery<br />12 Integration and Test<br />13 Facilities Management<br />14 Security<br />15 Configuration Management<br />16 Program Management<br />17 LAN/WAN Administration<br />18 Tape Management</p>
<p>A detailed description of the above services is provided as attachment 1 .<br /><br />In order to be eligible for award: Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) and Authorization to Operate must be in place by 31 July 2014. <br /><br />Reason for Lack of Competition [5.207(c) 15]: Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) and Authorization to Operate (ATO) must be in place by 31 July 2014. If the supplier is not C&amp;A and ATO and in-place by 31 July 2014, HUD experiencing an unacceptable lapse in its infrastructure services will result in a disruption in services provided to the general public, and will cause a negative impact on the national housing market. Due to the time required for designing, developing, testing, and implementation of an infrastructure environment in order to obtain C&amp;A; HUD has determined and concluded that HPES is on-site, providing the current support, and is the only viable supplier to meet the need of the agency . HUD'smanaged service environment requires the incumbent to furnish all personnel, materials, equipment, software, facilities, telecommunications and related services to deliver nationwide enterprise information technology, in support of HUD's objectives and responsibilities under Federal Legislation and Executive Orders. HPES delivers this service through its Contractor Owned and Contractor Operated (COCO) data centers. The contractor hosts approximately 176 applications, providing more than 450 Terabytes of data storage, Disaster Recovery for 35 applications, and wireless services to more than 1600 mobile devises.

<SUBJECT>--Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the intent of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to negotiate, on a sole source basis in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, an increase in the contract ceiling of the Infrastructure Replacement Project of the IDIQ Construction Contract (EP-C-07-058) performed at the U.S. EPA Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center (AWBERC) in Cincinnati, Ohio.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is it to be construed as market research; however, it is issued to mitigate unacceptable delays to agency?s requirements.  No solicitation package will be issued or accepted.  The current contract for which this notice is issued is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract that was competitively awarded on September 13, 2007. 
Accordingly, the action herein stated, will increase the ceiling by $8.5 million, effectively changing the Not-To-Exceed Contract value from $85 million to $93.5 million.  This contract was awarded with a two-year base period and eight one-year option periods.  
This contract will expire on September 12, 2017 and will not be extended; however it is necessary to increase the ceiling to complete the infrastructure replacement project.  
The U.S. EPA has conducted numerous tasks within the Infrastructure Replacement Project that, while not specifically known at the time of initial solicitation and award, have been essential to the overall success of the work that was identified in the requirement.  Consequently, those necessary, but ancillary tasks have placed an extraordinary strain on this contract from contract award to the present. 
Increasing the ceiling by $8.5 million will provide continued and seamless support of critical ongoing and future IRP projects at the AWBERC Facility, while supporting our customer?s requirements in successfully completing the Infrastructure Replacement Project.  
All work to be performed under this contract ceiling increase has been determined to be both within the scope of and in accordance with the original contract Statement of Work.  
The contractor, Langdon, Inc., was the awardee of this current contract, which was solicited and awarded under competitive guidelines in 2007.  The Langdon Inc. provided services under this contract are deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services where it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  Langdon Inc. is the only source available with the expertise to allow for effective and efficient continuation of the Infrastructure Replacement Project effort.  
Any questions regarding the above requirements should be submitted in writing to the points of contact listed below.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source purchase order and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NCHHSTP\DHPS hereby announces its intent to solicit and enter into a contract with National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637 for the procurement of (1) Six (6) questions in the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS)- 3 questions on HIV testing behavior and 3 questions on knowledge of HIV acquisition and (2) One (1) report examining HIV knowledge in the general U.S. population, 1990-present.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago manages the General Social Survey (GSS). CDC has been using this mechanism for general population data on HIV since 2004. Without consistency in data collection (e.g, this mechanism is a national probability sample and includes consistent questions about HIV over time), CDC could not measure trends over time in HIV knowledge which is a key feature of this product. NORC is the only offeror who can meet the performance goals of running and maintaining a nationwide probability sample to obtain and add questions on HIV testing and HIV knowledge. CDC has supported HIV testing questions in the GSS for approximately 10 years. The procurement for a specific report on trends in HIV knowledge will be done faster with the unique perspective of experts at NORC who oversee collection of the data. No other vendor currently conducts a national probability sample with questions on knowledge of HIV acquisition and HIV testing history at the necessary frequency or specificity required for CDC programmatic purposes. It is necessary for the government to monitor these behaviors in the general U.S. population to address objectives in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. NORC is the only vendor that has the authority to perform the necessary services, including adding necessary survey questions regarding HIV testing and risk behaviors, and implementing the nationwide probability sample. Therefore, they are the only proposed vendor that can perform the services necessary to meet government requirements.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 and the small business size standard is $14.0 million dollars. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties who feel they possess the expertise, experience and ability should submit a capabilities statement to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email at TJustice@cdc.gov or to Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, MS E15, 2960 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. Reference #2014-58082.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services and/or supplies in the future.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, the Government shall consider all responses received within seven (7) days of this posting, in accordance with FAR 5.203 (A)(1). If no affirmative responses are received within seven (7) days, negotiations will be conducted with National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center located in Cincinnati, OH has a requirement for the purchase of one Modular Mini Fragment LCP System, this system is used the Operating Room (OR) for orthopedic procedures requiring repair of hand, foot, and ulna fractures.
This request is to purchase one Modular Mini Fragment LCP System. This system is used in the OR for orthopedic surgeries of fixation for fractures, osteotomies, nonunions, replantations, and fusions of small bones and small bone fragments in the hand, wrist, foot, ankle, and ulna. Currently, the OR does not own a set like this and has been borrowing from either the Synthes sales representative or other hospitals within the area. Recent changes regarding our sterilization guidelines have prompted the need for the OR to own this set and have it readily accessible and on-site at all times.
All holes in the plates must be combination ("combi") holes so that the surgeon can place a screw either as a locking screw, neutral screw, or compression cortical screw. The plate screw locking interface must be shown as a positive mechanical mechanism allowing for a thread match and screws to be locked in to place. The system must not require cutting new threads in to the plates - all threads should be already placed within the system. All items must be able to be steam sterilized. A complete listing of all items and the necessary quantities that MUST be included in the system is below:
Please quote Brand Name or equal, new equipment only. See clause 52.211-6 below.

<p>&nbsp;<br />SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. Is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p><br />Regional UPS Battery Replacement Contract IDIQ</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Weather Service (NWS) issues watches, warnings, forecasts, and advisories for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas. An uninterrupted supply of power is critical to fulfill the mission of the NWS. UPS systems are a central component of providing this. Having replacement batteries available for these systems is at the core of maintaining the readiness of the NWS. Being locked to a single brand has proven to be cumbersome and has delayed proper maintenance of our UPS systems.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The NWS is seeking proposals for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract supplying an assortment of replacement Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) batteries for Central Region, Western Region, and Southern Region.</p>
<p>Central Region is headquartered in Kansas City Missouri and has thirty eight (38) Weather Forecast Offices (WFO), located in the following 14 states:<br />1. Colorado<br />2. Illinois<br />3. Indiana<br />4. Iowa<br />5. Kansas<br />6. Kentucky<br />7. Michigan<br />8. Minnesota<br />9. Missouri<br />10. Nebraska<br />11. North Dakota<br />12. South Dakota<br />13. Wisconsin<br />14. Wyoming</p>
<p><br />Southern Region is headquartered out of Fort Worth Texas and has thirty two (32) WFO, located in the following 10 states and Puerto Rico:<br />1. Alabama<br />2. Arkansas<br />3. Florida<br />4. Georgia<br />5. Louisiana<br />6. Mississippi<br />7. New Mexico<br />8. Oklahoma<br />9. Tennessee<br />10. Texas</p>
<p>Western Region is headquartered in Salt Lake City Utah and has twenty four (24) WFO, located in the following 8 states:<br />1. Arizona<br />2. California<br />3. Idaho<br />4. Montana<br />5. Nevada<br />6. Oregon<br />7. Utah<br />8. Washington</p>
<p>Scope:<br />This contract will provide replacement batteries for each UPS specified in this SOW and allow flexibility to overcome supply disruptions from a single manufacture,</p>
<p>General Conditions:<br />&#9679; The contractor shall have each set of batteries securely strapped to a standard 48"X40" pallet <br />&#9679; The contractor shall provide a list of local pick up sites in each region to aid in savings from shipping costs, where available<br />&#9679; The contractor shall provide the batteries ordered within 30 days.</p>
<p>Typical Ordering:<br />Batteries for installation in a Powerware UPS will typically be ordered as a set of forty (40) batteries<br />Batteries for installation in a Mitsubishi UPS will typically be ordered as a set of thirty (30) batteries</p>
<p>Shipping of Batteries:<br />When shipping of batteries is required, unless otherwise noted, the batteries are to be delivered in a small vehicle such as pickup or cargo van/truck with lift gate capabilities, as most locations have no loading or unloading capabilities, and typically cannot accommodate a large freight tractor trailer. Shipping of batteries will be paid for through the use of a government purchase card at time of shipping.</p>
<p>Customer pickup:<br />&bull; Mandatory no cost customer pick up shall be available in the Kansas city metro area<br />&bull; Optionally a no cost customer pick up can be provided inside of Eastern, and Western Regions</p>

Offerors intending to deliver the SF330 in person to the facility at the address above are cautioned that this NAVFAC Southwest facility is located in downtown San Diego. It is recommended that the Offeror allows for delays in driving through downtown San Diego caused by traffic (both freeway and downtown), train/trolley crossing, parking at the pay lots/meters near the facility, and gaining access to a secure Government facility. No parking or offloading of SF330s is available at the Government facility. SF330s are to be delivered to the mailroom in Building 128 and reasonable time shall be allowed for the person in the mailroom to receive and time stamp the SF330. The stamp time is determined from the NAVFAC Southwest facility mailroom time stamp and not any other time keeping equipment that the Offeror may own. Immediately upon SF330 delivery the Offeror shall leave the Government facility. An Offeror that does not leave the premises may be requested to leave or be escorted off the premises.</p>

<p>9. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing quotes, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) price; (iii) warranty; (iv) delivery. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to award an order to AON Hewitt for actuarial services of post-retirement benefits.
<p>The OCC's Financial Management section is in need of a renewal of its post-retirement actuarial valuation services. These services provide the OCC with a full scope actuarial valuation of the OCC and OTS frozen grandfather retiree group, postretirement life insurance benefits liability. The purpose of this valuation is to fulfill the OCC's accounting requirements under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, Employer's Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits other than Pensions.</p>
<p>Only AON Hewitt has been deemed capable of satisfying this requirement because:<br />1) They possess institutional knowledge/capability relating to this requirement that can only be attained through being the incumbent vendor<br />2) It would not be cost-effective to award this requirement to another vendor based on extensive market research that showed other vendors would charge 10 to 16 times greater for these services <br />3) Awarding this requirement to AON Hewitt is a logical follow on to TOTSD10P00106</p>
<p>This requirement will have a period of performance as follows:<br />Base period: 03/07/2014 - 10/01/2014<br />And Up to 4 Option Years as follows:<br />Option Period 1: 10/02/2014 - 10/01/2015 <br />Option Period 2: 10/02/2015 - 10/01/2016<br />Option Period 3: 10/02/2016 - 10/01/2017<br />Option Period 4: 10/02/2017 - 10/01/2018</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide a service that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within (10) days after publication of this synopsis.
