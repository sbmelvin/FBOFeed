<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to assess the impact of a new process for formulary decision makers to obtain information, including cost-effectiveness information, on drug products
that are being considered for inclusion on formularies.  The project goal is to facilitate and guide improvements in this process.  The project is consistent with the House Appropriation
Committee Report encouraging AHRQ to “support an initiative to identify and make easily accessible the findings of existing, scientifically sound, cost-effectiveness studies of new clinical interventions and technologies.”

The contractor will analyze the contents of dossiers submitted by pharmaceutical companies in response to requests by managed care organizations and others as part of their process for reviewing drugs for inclusion on formularies.   The focus of the
analysis will be an assessment of the quality of dossiers prepared according to the American Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Format for Formulary Submissions, a guideline
developed in 2000.  Specifically, the analysis will determine whether the evidence of clinical effectiveness submitted using this Format is complete and appropriate, evaluate the quality
and extent of information submitted addressing off-label uses of the drug in question, and evaluate the quality of economic information submitted.  With respect to economic information, the
contractor shall focus on 1) estimates of effectiveness
in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), assessing whether the CEA has considered all relevant clinical studies, and the quality of studies used as a basis for these estimates including their
use of relevant comparators; 2) use of modeling, assessing such questions as the appropriateness of extrapolation beyond available study endpoints; and 3) other aspects of CEA methods.  The contractor shall also collect information about the
advantages and problems encountered in implementing a structured format to obtain information from drug companies, including
resource demands of the process.  All findings will be detailed in a report due at the close of the project.

The contractor shall produce the following scheduled reports/deliverables within the time frame indicated.  

Tasks:
1.  Plan detailing sites and dates for information
    collection and data collection instruments.
    Should identify data elements that will address
    requirements outlined in statement of work.
    Due Date - Sept 31, 2004

2.  Progress Report - Due Date - Feb 1, 2005

3.  Draft Report - Due Date - July 1, 2005

4.  Final Report - Due Date - Sept 30, 2005

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD. 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in Far Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number: 4011275125-00038,  is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates  provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.   This procurement shall be solicited on a unrestricted basis.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code is 334516.     U.S. Dept. of Agriculture intends to procure a quantity of 1 each of  the following item: “Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification” with Product Number: 13443101”, (or equivalent),  plus 8 other additional items as specified below  - Manufactured by the vendor: “Amersham Biosciences Corporation” - who are located at 800 Centennial Avenue,   in Piscataway, New Jersey   08855-1327 - and they can be reached at phone # 1-800-527-3593.  “The following are U.S. Dept. Of Agriculture’s  minimum requirements for the above  item:   Shall have the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems.   Shall have the following sample characteristics: molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.  Shall be able to automate the running of large, open columns on the system, and a variety of gel filtration media.   Flow rate range shall be in the range from .05-20mls/per minute at pressures ranging from 0-700psi.    Shall be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing.  Shall have the entire flow path be inert to halides.  The  system’s pumps shall allow operation of the system at zero back pressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports.   The controller shall allow programs to be time-based, volume based, or column-volume based, and shall allow user intervention of a running method (e.g., change of flow rate) without stopping or pausing the run.   The system shall include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software.   Shall have the ability to control nine motorized valves for column selection , buffer selection, flow reversal, and multi-dimensional chromatography.   The motorized valves shall provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves shall be driven electronically and requires no external air pressure to operate.   The system controller shall allow the end-user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.   The system controller shall allow up to nine motorized valves, chart recorder, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, air sensors, and three pumps.   The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector shall all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees Celsious.      The controller shall accept seven input signals (e.g. UV Wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure.)   The system controller shall be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, which shall allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.    The system shall include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which shall allow for sample loading onto the column.   The system controller shall allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, and gradient slope- which shall allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system.   Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution shall be capable of being monitored , with a feed-back loop to the control system, so the end-user can be certain the equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.   Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left un-recorded.   Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions shall also be included.   In order to protect our columns, the system shall have a definable pressure limit system which shall stop the pump and generate and audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.   The controller shall also allow the end-user the option of including in their chromatographic methods program, which commands shall automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column.   Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes) which shall include UV or conductivity signals.   The controller shall permit automatic running of up to 99 different chromatographic programs in a user-designated sequence; it shall turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved; the system shall automatically and continuosly be able to record throughout each chromatographic run with the following parameters: flow rate; auto-scaled UV signal; actual AND programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent PH; system pressure; accumulated time of run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector, and this shall allow these recorded types of data to be called up later for interpretation, and to aid in future replication of results; it shall allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports.   Shall include installation and training for the above system.  The following 8 lined items are Accessories that go with the above system: (1) Product Number: 18103211, Rinsing Tube, Quantity of 1 each;   (2) Product Number: 18110841, PV-908, 25MPA, Quantity of 2 each; (3) Product Number: 18608312, Rack B, 12 MM, FRAC-950 Tubes, Quantity of 1 each; (4) Product Number: 18672700, Pump P-960, Quantity of 1 each; (5) Product Number: 18117584, Air Sensor A-912N Kit, Quantity of 1 each; (6) Product Number: 18111381, Superloop, 10 ML, Quantity of 1 each; (7) Product Number: 18102385, Superloop, 150 ML, Quantity of 1 each; and (8) Product Number: 18115424, Akta User Kit, Quantity of 1 each.    “F.O..B.

<DESC>17.	Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate/Power Division (AFRL/PRP) solicits research proposals for Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space.  The Power Division (AFRL/PRP) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to develop, demonstrate and improve upon key power and thermal technologies supporting air and space applications in the areas of Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The technical improvements in these four areas will contribute toward meeting the Power Division's goals in the 2009 and beyond timeframe, and goals deemed necessary to facilitate nearer-term transition or transfer.   

Power and thermal technologies for aircraft support the integrated goals of the joint DoD/NASA/Industry More Electric Initiative.  Advanced power technologies support the initiative to develop directed energy weapons and place these weapons on airborne platforms.  The airborne use of directed energy weapons is driving the onboard electrical power requirements beyond the limits of conventional electrical power and thermal management systems and has driven the need to develop the necessary power generation, distribution and conditioning technologies required for the airborne use of these weapons.  Power technologies for space applications develop innovative technologies to reduce spacecraft size and weight, increase efficiency, increase operational life and develop affordable spacecraft.  

The over arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of a 7-year open-ended solicitation spanning the four major technology areas of Power Generation, Power Management and Distribution, Energy Storage and Subsystem Integration for Air and Space applications.  This strategy will provide AFRL/PRP an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs on a “real-time” basis as ever-changing technology issues are identified.  

The BAA will remain “open” for 7 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during "calls".  Each call will identify solicitation topics and will contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission.  

The first “call” for proposals occurs with the issuance of this BAA.  Refer to Part 5 of the solicitation for detailed information concerning the Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Scientific Research Program.  This program will sponsor scientific research and early development of materials, thermal concepts, battery cells and others, in the following four major research areas in which problems frequently arise which require unique and innovative solutions: Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The anticipated funding for this program is $49M.

Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement

NATURE OF SURVEY: Audience data shall be obtained through a survey of Dehli, Patna, and Lucknow.

SAMPLE DESIGN:  Interested offerors are herein requested to submit price quotations for a survey covering all three cities, each with a sample of 1000 adults age 15 or older and fully representative of the population of the cities in question.  If necessary, weights shall be derived and applied to the survey data by the contractor to bring the sample into conformity with the other characteristics of the entire populations of the survey universe in each city.  The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.  Only one individual per household shall be selected, and at least three attempts shall be made to interview selected respondents before substitution is allowed.  A detailed Sampling Plan, including stratification criteria, description of the sampling frame, listing of anticipated Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), approximate number of interviews in each, procedures for selecting households within PSUs, and procedures for selecting individual respondents at the household level, shall be submitted to and approved by IBB prior to commencement of fieldwork.

The contractor shall prepare translations of the questionnaire in all languages agreed upon and shall submit these translations to IBB for approval prior to pre-test.  The contractor shall be responsible for compiling a comprehensive list of both local and international broadcast media available in the areas to be surveyed.  This information shall be used to compile a precoded list of stations on the survey and shall be submitted to IBB for approval prior to finalization of the questionnaire.  Following IBB's review of any contractor comments and final approval of translations of questionnaires, the contractor shall prepare final versions in English and other languages as agreed in form suitable for use by interviewers.  PRE-TEST:   The questionnaire shall be pre-tested by the contractor prior to the commencement of the fieldwork.  At least 25 pre-test interviews shall be conducted.  The contractor shall provide IBB with a written report of the results of the pre-test, along with details of any problems encountered and suggested remedies, prior to the commencement of fieldwork.  FIELDWORK:  Fieldwork for both surveys shall begin as soon as possible after contract award.  Interviews shall be conducted by experienced field workers who shall be thoroughly briefed by the contractor prior to commencement of any work.  The contractor shall ensure that interviewers are thoroughly familiar with household and respondent selection procedures, call back procedures, and the structure of the questionnaire, including routing and filtering.  Interviewer training shall include practice sessions in administering the questionnaire.  A minimum of 10% of interviews shall be back checked and 5%  shall be accompanied by a team supervisor.  The contractor's proposal shall include a description of the professional qualifications of the proposed interviewers and a description of the training that will be provided to interviewers. DATA PROCESSING:  The contractor is responsible for data entry, cleaning, and processing.  The contractor shall provide printed tabulations of results, including percentage responses to all questions broken down by gender, age group, and educational level. Tabulations shall show weighted and unweighted base for each question.  The contractor shall provide data to IBB as an SPSS for Windows syntax file (*.sps) (SPSS version 10.0 or lower) file and as an SPSS "*.sav" file with a complete data dictionary of variable names and value labels.

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Scott AFB IL 62225-5015.  The MACC is contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 – Construction, Subsection 233 – Building Development and General Contracting – size standard $28.5 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 – Heavy Construction – size standard $12 Million and Subsector 235 – Special Trade Contractors – Size standard $12 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build (ranging from 35% up to 100% level of effort), renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $500,000 - $3,000,000.  The program value is Not-to-Exceed $90,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.   
The government may award as many as eight (8) contracts but anticipates awarding approximately six (6) contracts.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.  
The RFP will identify a seed project that will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requriements among the awardees. Offerors are encouraged to scrutinize the solicitation carefully when posted for more information. This acquisition is being considered for a partial HUBZone and Section 8(a) set-aside.    If your firm is HUBZone certified and intends to propose on this acquisition, you must provide the following information to the Contracting Officer not later than ten (10) days after the publication of this notice: (a) SBA Certification of HUBZone eligibility; (b) a positive statement of your intention to bid on this contract as a prime contractor; (c) evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and; (d) availability of bonding of at least $15,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project.  
The solicitation is expected to be issued on or around 15 March 04.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package.

All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) of the Government’s intent to solicit for potential sources for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 through FY 06.  The Government intends to compete and award the entire Air Force Summer Faculty Program by 29 September 2004 with one option as stated herein. Furthermore a formal Request for Proposal via the Federal Business (FEDBIZOps) web site (http://www.eps.gov) for potential sources for the SFFP as described herein will be announced on or around 1 July 2004 from the United States Air Force, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) seeking a qualified contractor for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 with one option for FY 06.    In 1979, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) initiated the Summer Faculty Research Program (SFRP) to introduce research faculty into Air Force laboratory facilities across the US.  The intent of the program has been to bolster research efforts and build critical links between Air Force scientists and their counterparts in the academic community.  The original SFRP was concluded in 1999 and a new program, the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program replaced it.  Under the SFFP, US College, university, or technical institute faculty members (known as SFFP fellows) perform mentor-based research in areas of interest to the Air Force in Air Force research facilities. The objectives of the program are to: 
1)	Provide the fellows high-quality, meaningful, mentor-based research at AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
2)	 Provide the fellows opportunities to stimulate professional relationships among the scientists and engineers in AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
3)	Enhance the research interests and capabilities of faculty in the US academic community
4)	Elevate the awareness of the US academic community of Air Force research needs 
During the summer, the fellows, under the mentorship of AF researchers, will conduct research at Air Force research facilities for a period of eight (8) to twelve (12) weeks.  AFOSR intends to award between forty (40) to one hundred (100) awards per year with awards restricted to university faculty members with PhDs in science, mathematics, or engineering and who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. To be considered qualified for this effort; prospective sources must demonstrate detailed knowledge and experience in the following areas: 
•	Ability  to advertise and select outstanding researchers who hold doctoral degrees, including providing an on-line web-site method of applying for the SFFP
•	Ability to establish an applicant review (evaluation) process and assemble review panels of experts to evaluate candidates’ applications (Panel experts shall be authorities in their field with previous research experience related to the areas of interest to the Air Force). 
•	 Ability to establish and maintain a database of AFRL research mentors for SFFP fellows, and a database of research interests for Air Force research facilities to provide high-quality research opportunities in these technical areas
•	Ability to establish and maintain a financial management system for electronically issuing fellows stipends and tracking costs.
•	Have an established prestigious reputation in science and engineering fellowship management. 
	 Under a contract, the dispensation provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement. The contract will cover administrative costs of the program and also for transfer of funds (pass through funds) to the contractor to pay recipient stipends. The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $30.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  
	   	Interested persons may identify their interest to respond to the requirement or submit proposals at the appropriate time. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.

ANSI A10.8-1988, Scaffolding Safety Requirements, Section 9 states the following:  “9.15 System-scaffold components manufactured by different companies shall not be intermixed”.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity supply type contract.  It may include the ability to either purchase or rent the staging materials.  The period of performance for the Base Year is date of award through 1-year thereafter.  Up to four 1-year option periods may be included.  FOB Destination at PSNS Bremerton WA.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), Macromolecular  Crystallography Unit (MCU), plans to procure on a sole source basis a Minstrel I crystal imaging robot for crystallization from Rigaku/MSC, Inc., 9009 New Trails Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77381. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The NCI, LCB, studies structure and function of macromolecular assemblies, especially those related to cancer development, treatment, and prevention, primarily using the X-ray crystallographic methodology and requiring a facility for protein crystal growth for X-ray diffraction experiment and for data collection.  Our project focuses on the crystallization and structure determination of integral membrane proteins involved in cellular multi-drug resistance (MDR).  The difficulties involved in membrane protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography lie in the fact that it is extremely hard to produce large amount of membrane proteins and large amount of the membrane protein surface is hydrophobic, which defies crystallization attempts. We would like to purchase a crystal-imaging robot for examining 96-well crystallization plates, either in sitting drop or in hanging drop, or in micro-batch format.  The Minstrel ITM crystal imaging system is an integrated system designed to fit on a lab bench.  It is a fully modular and expandable automated protein crystal imaging and analysis system. With its extensive list of options, the Minstrel I can be configured to meet a broad range performance requirements, from low-throughput research applications to demanding high-throughput drug discovery programs. The Minstrel I utilizes an ultra-high resolution imaging system that can quickly and consistently image hanging drop, sitting drop, and microbatch experiment in a broad range of plate types.  A programmable light source optimizes the imaging conditions for each drop and plate type.   Minstrel I will greatly relieve the physical stress of an individual as a result of manual inspection of numerous crystallization plates.  Minstrel I provides highest resolution possible for imaging.   Minstrel I is flexible, modular and upgradable, simple to use, has a superior data annotation system, and raid 5 data storage.  The crystal imaging robot must be able to handle various crystallization plates such as SBS or linbro/BDX foot print. The bench top design should have a foot print 21"x21" or less. It should have a 5 mega pixel resolution color camera for high quality images with 0.7 to 4.5 x zoom lens with automatic zoom and focus. The robot should also have automatic drop location capability with programmable LED white-light ring light source for optimal lighting of all plate types. It should possess an image database and can be operated in a temperature range between 4 °C and room temperature. Manual control of camera, lens, lighting and robotics are possible.  Rigaku/MSC, Inc is the only source known to the NCI that designs and manufactures equipment and reagents, and packages these products specifically for protein crystallization experiments.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 9, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number NCI- 40143-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

Due to packaging and volume constraints on the launch vehicle, the solar arrays and HGA systems must be stowed alongside the spacecraft for launch, which must then be positioned into their operational configurations by the Deployment System.  Restraint and Release Actuators are required to hold the Deployment System components in their stowed position for launch and then release them such that deployment can occur. The vendor shall provide the facilities, personnel, services, tools, equipment, and materials necessary to perform the work and deliver the items specified. The contractor shall generate a matrix listing each requirement in the statement of work and associated specification, 464-MECH-SPEC-0077, reflecting either compliance or non-compliance. Areas of non-compliance need to be addressed by the contractor showing how they plan to meet the requirement(s) or why it will remain non-compliant.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to  Cassandra.K.Atkinson@nasa.gov or via fax at 301-286-1773 no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 9, 2004. Please contact Miss Atkinson for an electronic copy of the Statement of Work. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Inter-American Foundation (IAF), through the Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to issue a purchase order to Synergos on a sole-source basis.  Synergos will study the feasibility of establishing a community-based institution to support grassroots development in the Gulf of Paria. The feasibility study will be co-financed with Conoco-Phillips Venezuela S.A. (Conoco) pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between the IAF and Conoco on jointly financing grassroots development initiatives on the east coast of Venezuela. 

The feasibility assessment will be undertaken in four phases. Phase One will include planning and relationship-building. Synergos will specifically map socio-economic variables key to the Gulf of Paria area and, more broadly, the status of civil society in Venezuela. Phase Two will survey community leadership and organizational capacity in the area. Depending on the outcome of Phase Two, Phase Three will either identify models for the local development institution or assess alternatives (e.g., a long-term analysis of the community development potential in the region). Phase Four will include specific recommendations, including a resource mobilization strategy among other U.S. and multinational corporations with oil and gas concessions in the Gulf of Paria, and an implementation plan.
 
Synergos staff and Senior Fellows will provide a framework for assessing, evaluating and recommending the best strategy for any future co-funding by IAF and Conoco in the Gulf of Paria area. Synergos will contract local consultants as needed, including for the survey in Phase Two. The IAF will work closely with Synergos and Conoco to ensure an objective, practical assessment.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than September 9, 2004.  Affirmative responses shall reference RFQ-04-112 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source award will be made to the Synergos.

<DESC>I.  PURPOSE OF WORK & BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests [GMUG]has an active oil and gas program. The GMUG currently implements oil and gas leasing under the Oil and Gas Leasing EIS and Record of Decision (ROD) (1993).  This EIS and Decision made certain lands available and authorized for oil and gas leasing, and established surface use stipulations for protection of surface resources to be applied at the leasing stage.  Interest in gas leasing on portions of the GMUG has increased in the past several years, and has resulted in a backlog of gas lease parcel requests needing to be processed. The major reason for the large backlog of gas lease parcels is that the lynx was listed as an endangered species since the 1993 Leasing EIS and ROD were completed. The GMUG Oil and Gas Leasing EIS must be updated to consider impacts to the lynx, and develop surface use stipulations for oil and gas activities that might occur in lynx habitat.  The surface use stipulations will be needed electronically for all lands available for leasing on the GMUG that also contain lynx habitat so that those stipulations can be shown on the gas lease parcel records.

The availability of GIS reduces the amount of time needed to prepare an individual gas lease parcel request.  Most of the GMUG lands available for leasing have the surface use stipulations in an electronic format.  However, the GMUG has identified that these data are not in an electronic format for lands on the Norwood Ranger District.  Placing these data in a GIS format will decrease the time needed to process the parcels, and will also be used in Forest Plan revision process.  Completion of these tasks will enable the GMUG to meet the direction of Executive Order 13121, which calls Federal Agencies to expedite the processing of energy-related projects.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Surgery Branch (SB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with MJ Research Inc., 5350 Capital Court, Suite #102, Reno, NV  89502 for a Chromo4 module upgrade.  A major focus of studies carried out in the Surgery Branch is the development of effective immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with cancer, many of which require the analysis of gene expression. These including the analysis of the expression of genes that encode antigens as well as proteins involved with antigen recognition in tumor cells as well as the expression of genes in T cells that play important roles in antigen recognition. One of the most important methods for analyzing gene expression, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), requires the use of advanced instrumentation.  The Chromo4 module upgrade incorporates a 96-well unit that will allow the SB Government owned MJ DNA engine to be upgraded to a qPCR instrument.  This instrument is capable of simultaneously detecting 4 individual fluorochromes, and it can be easily customized to allow the detection of additional fluorochromes for future studies. The Chromo4 module employs a Photonics Shuttle, not available on other qPCR instruments, that rides above the sample plate to individually illuminate and detect each sample.  This feature allows maximum sensitivity to be achieved with minimal crosstalk, yielding a high signal-to-noise ratio.  In addition, use of the Photonics Shuttle results in an identical light path for excitation and detection, resulting in the elimination of any potential positional bias in sample readings.  The MJ Research Chromo4 module upgrade is the only know piece of equipment that can upgrade the SB Government owned DNA Engine into a qPCR instrument.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations; however, if any interested party believes it can meet all of the above requirements, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The Government’s intent is to upgrade one of its instruments, and capability statements offering a new qPCR instrument will not be considered.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 31, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament  Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC),  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is soliciting on a Full and Open Competition   basis the requirement for the manufacture and delivery of 5.56mm, M862   Short Range Training Cartridges in the following quantity ranges:  For  FY04: 700,000 - 1,000,000 each; 1,000,001 - 1,300,000 each; Each Option   Year, FY05, FY06, FY07 & FY08 will have the following ranges:  700,000 –   2,000,000 each; 2,000,001 – 4,000,000 each; 4,000,001 – 6,000,000 each;   6,000,001 – 8,000,000 each. This cartridge matches the trajectory of   standard 5.56mm combat ammunition out to 25 Meters while having a maximum   range of no greater than 250 Meters. This allows realistic training at   sites where range restrictions prohibit the firing of standard 5.56mm   ammunition.

The cartridge shall conform to the requirements of the   M862 Performance Specification. Only those cartridge designs which  have previously been qualified by the government in accordance  with the M862 performance specification shall be considered.   Solicitation W15QKN-04-R-0610 is released in conjunction with this   notice.  All proposals should be submitted electronically to:  Louisa Meléndez: melendez@pica.army.mil no later than August 31,   2004, 2:00 PM (EDT). All information is to be submitted at no cost or   obligation to the Government. Respondents must demonstrate a   capability for high rate production and delivery of these cartridges.   Any non-qualified sources who would be interested in submitting a   proposal, will be responsible to qualify their round at their own   expense in order to be considered for award. In order to be eligible     to compete for the award, a cartridge must be fully qualified by the   closing date of the formal solicitation.    See Numbered Note 9 & 12.

<DESC>The Seattle District US Army Corps of Engineers anticipates a sole-source award to Helix Architecture for follow-on work to task orders 0027 and 0028 to expired competitive Architect-Engineering Contract No. DACA67-01-D-0202.  This follow-on work is for the development of additional submittals for the two task orders.  Justification for sole-source is the Contractors possession of proprietary information such as the original submittal and submittal development information.  Award to any other source will result in the need to create submission data at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government the recovery of which is not likely through competition.  Additionally, with short 30-day project suspense; competition of this procurement will create  unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements.  The dollar range for this project is $25k to $50k.

This procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimum standards for design and construc tion quality.

This announcement also includes resultant clarifications to the original announcement, repeated here for convenient reference. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to solicit proposals for the acquisition of an irrevocable, perpetual license to use 750 knockout mice, delivered as frozen embryos, sperm, and ES cells to designated Depositories, which shall act under separate contract to NIH to maintain and distribute the Material. The depositories will distribute the Materials to academic users along with a royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual license to use the Material for non-commercial research purposes.  Academic Institutions will be free to file patents on discoveries made with the Material without reach-through rights to any successful offeror or any other party.

The Government also intends to acquire a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license to use and host a database containing detailed phenotyping information on all 750 mice for academic and other non-commercial purposes.  Restrictions on the use of the Database for academic and other non-commercial purposes will be removed after four years.  

The proposed acquisition will include a  non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and fully-paid up license to publish in other works or media any of the data from the Database and to create derivative works of any of the data by extracting or reformatting all or any portion of the data, whether in its original form or any revised, annotated or modified forms.

The proposed contract will provide to academic investigators world-wide access to a significant fraction of this unique line of knockout mice along with a database containing extensive phenotypic data on each of the 750 knockout lines.
	
The estimated release date for the solicitation is mid August.  The estimated receipt date for proposals is mid September.

<SUBJECT>S -- Potential Sources Sought for the Privatization of the Water, Wastewater, and Electric Utility Systems, Naval District Washington, West Area, Dahlgren Detachment, Dahlgren, VA
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-UP0032
<RESPDATE>091304
<ARCHDATE>09282004
<CONTACT>Clenton Shanks, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-322-4157, Fax 757-322-4178, Email clenton.shanks@navy.mil
<DESC>The Navy seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, “Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.”  Naval District Washington, West Area, Dahlgren Detachment, Dahlgren, VA. is seeking interest and information specifically for the privatization of water, wastewater and electric distribution and generation utility systems.  The resulting privatization will include assumption of ownership, operation, and maintenance, and obligation to continue the service for an indefinite and ongoing period.

Should privatization result, the ownership of the entire utility plant and/or distribution system, including all operating responsibility shall transfer to a regional or municipal utility or to a private company.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility provider’s responsibility.  It is intended that privatization will reduce the Navy’s life cycle costs.
 
The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size and general description of the system.  Any numbers may only be estimates for this purpose.


Naval District Washington, West Area, Dahlgren Detachment, Dahlgren, VA.
 
WATER SYSTEM: The components of the water system currently in operation on the Main Site of the Dahlgren Naval Surface Warfare Center include three wells, a 275,000-gallon ground level storage tank with transfer pumps, and four 100,000 gallon elevated storage tanks. The tanks are 150 feet tall and the line pressure for the system is approximately 58 psi.  The system is chlorinated to provide disinfect ion treatment by the use of gas chlorination equipment located at each well. The operating permit designates that the system can process 1.17 MGD or 2,920 equivalent residential connections.  The components of the system in operation at the Pumpkin Neck Explosives Experimental Area include a single artesian well with a submersible pump and motor and a limited radial distribution system.  The well site has three 275-gallon hydro pneumatic storage tanks and a sodium hypochlorite liquid disinfect ion system.  There are no fire hydrants located at Pumpkin neck.  The Pumpkin Neck operating permit designates that the system has a design capacity of four equivalent residential connections.   The water distribution system consists of approximately 106,000 linear foot of primarily of cast-iron mains ranging up to 16 inches in diameter.  In addition there are approximately 51,000 linear feet of service lines.  Much of the system is over 50 years old.  Average monthly usage for calendar year 2000 was 12.8 MG.  The system serves both domestic and fire protection requirements.  

WASTEWATER SYSTEM: Sewage generated at NSWCDD is collected and transmitted to the sewage treatment plant by a series of gravity sewers, force mains and pumping stations.  Approximately 22 miles of gravity sewers and force mains and 34 sewage pump stations comprise the sewage collection system.  The sewage treatment plant has an average daily flow capacity of 0.72 mgd and can handle a peak flow of 1.4 mgd on a short-term basis.  Effluent from the treatment plant is discharged to Machodoc Creek and ultimately enters the Potomac River.  The NSWCDD sewage treatment plant is classified as Reliability Class 1, because its discharge affects shellfish beds.    A constructed wetland polishes secondary clarifier effluent and provides a buffer between the treated sewage and shellfish beds located downstream on the Potomac River.  During large rain events the constructed wetland becomes hydraulically overloaded.  Under these circumstances a fixed overflow pipe at the parshall flume directs excessive flows directly to the UV disinfection system. 

ELECTRIC SYSTEM: Dominion Virginia Power Company provides the main electrical utility service.  The electrical service is fed into the main substation by overhead 34.5KV distribution lines from Dahlgren Road (Route 206). The entire base is fed via duct bank and manhole systems and also direct buried cable.  All cable is 35KV or 15KV rated.  Most of the cable has been replaced in the past fifteen years.  The 34.5KV distribution is fed from the Main Gate Substation to ten substations and switching stations. Four of the substations are 13.8KV secondary and the rest are 4160 volt secondary.   Most of the substations have been replaced within the past fifteen years or have been installed new due to growth on the base.   During FY03 the peak daily commercial power demand was 17,692 KW.  The peak monthly consumption was 10,141,100 KWH.


It is requested and expected that no private or municipal utility service provider shall indicate interest or provide information unless capable of and willing to comply with the following requirements pertaining to the ownership and operation of the above utility systems.  

RESEARCH MISSION.  The installation has an ongoing mission to conduct research and development in the area of utility infrastructure assurance.  As a direct result, the utility system owner/operator shall be expected to accommodate a variety of circumstances that are not normal to the ownership and operation of a utility.  The installation, in the fulfillment of its mission, retains the full and unfettered capability to engage in a series of research and development activities affecting the utility systems.  Such activities may include (but are not limited to) exercising unlimited access and control of the affected utility for test purposes, conducting effects testing against the utilities infrastructure, placement, maintenance and operation of a variety of sensors and control devices on the utility systems, and the training of installation personnel on utility system operations, control and consequence management.  Existing SCADA and DDC control systems will continue to function for monitoring and control purposes and will remain Government property.  Research and development projects are frequently classified.  The owner/operator will be required to maintain certain contract employees with a security clearance at a level equal to or greater than Secret.  Due to the nature of the existing research mission, the utility service area shall be considered to be a closed system and limited to areas within the Government Installation boundaries.  The owner/operator may not use the installation utilities infrastructure to serve or benefit areas or customers outside the service area without specific Government approval.  The Government will indemnify the contractor from any harm that may occur as a result of its research activities.
 
  
This Request for Information (RFI) is required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the Department of the Navy’s utilities privatization program.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals (RFP).  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal RFP will be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a Statement of Interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length, printed on one side only, and double-spaced) on or before 13 September 2004.  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to purchase, expand, and operate a utility system; (3) a statement showing its understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4) understanding of any applicable state or local utility law or franchise requirements, and capability of complying with such requirements; (5) understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and its familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state for which the utility is located and US Environmental Protection Agency, Region – III; (6) interest shall be indicated for each individual utility system, i.e. list all systems that are of interest and (7) a specific written acknowledgement of the Research Mission listed in this RFI.  The Government does not intend to issue a conveyance document on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for the information solicited. It should be noted that individual RFIs for different utility systems may be issued in the same time frame.  A separate response to each RFI is required.  There will be no site visits. 
Statements of Interest must be submitted to Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic, Attention: AQ146, 6506 Hampton Boulevard, Norfolk, Virginia 23508-1278.

The estimated price range is $60,000,000-80,000,000. A bid bond is required.    This solicitation  is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. This procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimum standards for design and construct ion quality. The solicitation criteria rely predominately upon military standards for barracks, headquarters buildings, and company operating facilities to meet program specific requirements for the Army's Program.  The objective of this solicitation is to  obtain a fully functional brigade-sized barracks complex.  The complex includes two 240 pn Barracks buildings, five company operations facilities, eight hangar company operation facilities, three battalion headquarters with classrooms, a brigade headquart ers, a troop aid station, and a dining facility.  The successful Offeror must design and construct a complete and useable facility, as described in the RFP documents.  The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that g ives the Government the greatest confidence in the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to meet the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s requirements in an affordable manner.   Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the RFP in all aspects of project execution.  A site visit will also be scheduled, date/time to be determined, for the Offerors, p rior to submittal of proposals, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site.  The evaluation team will use the Color Coding system, which uses colors to indicate the degree to which the offeror's proposal meets the standards for each factor evaluated.  Evaluators will identify strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies and risks and prepar e narrative statements in order for the contracting officer to make selection decisions. The evaluation process essentially consists of the following parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, price evaluation, cost/technical trade-off analysis and final determination by the Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Of ficer.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.

This part of the evaluations is conducted without the related price proposals.  The evaluation process will include an assessment of risk--primarily in the  areas of quality, cost, and schedule.  The price analysis is conducted in accordance w ith FAR part 15 by a separate team.   Technical factors are listed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3, and so on.  Within each factor, sub-factors are of equal importance.  Award for this procurement will b e based on technical factors and price, which together constitute a best value to the Government, although not necessarily to the lowest price.

<DESC>The Consolidated Acquisition Service, VISN 6, Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources for dietetic management software that can manage the diet office and administrative nutrition functions for a fully integrated healthcare system of eight medical centers. The system will be a Windows based environment and have a relational database.  A Windows face on a text-based system is not acceptable.  Software must integrate with US Department of Veterans Affairs VistA system through HL7 interface to obtain patient information.  One database server will accommodate multiple sites with full autonomy or standardized data among several sites.  The product should have a full drag and drop/point and click functionality and the ability to open multiple screens simultaneously.   The administrative software component must be able to produce recipes for the Central Production Unit at each site.  It must have the ability to calculate quantities for food orders from the Subsistence Prime Vendor and link them to Prime Vendor stock number.  Nutritional and cost information must integrate automatically into the recipes and menus.  Hazard Analysis of Critical Points (HACCP) guidelines must be integrated into the recipes.   The diet office software should include up to 12 diet restrictions.  Software must enable admission, discharge, transfer and diet order interface transmissions that can be monitored in "real time."  The system should have standardized patterns but allow each facility the ability to enter customized meal patterns.  Menu conflicts for diet restrictions, food preferences and allergies should be flagged on screen with automatic corrections.  Tray tickets can be printed for each patient, by the ward or for the entire delivery point. System must be compatible with hand-held devices for remote menu selections.   Federal Supply Schedule vendors offering this software under their GSA contract should include their contract number and line items numbers for the items they are quoting.  Interested parties must submit product data in writing to Jeff Benton, Contracting Officer, VA Medical Center, 2300 Ramsey Street, Fayetteville, NC 28301 not later than 4:30pm local time September 8, 2004. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is for the purchase, installation, training and maintenance support of dietetic management software. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with a sole source negotiation with Computrition, Inc., the only known source for this software.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT; THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.    The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their ability to perform the work contemplated in a future solicitation. Following is a general description of work for the anticipated contract:     Project: Evaluation of Airborne Sensors for Fine-Scale Monitoring of Road, Trail, and Riparian Corridors in NPS Units of the Northern Colorado Plateau Network     Scope: National Park Service (NPS) units of the Northern Colorado Plateau Inventory and Monitoring Network (NCPN), with the support of the U.S. Geological Survey's Southwest Biological Sciences Center (USGS SBSC), have identified a need for monitoring road, trail, and riparian corridors to detect changes in the spatial distribution / extent of soil-surface disturbances and changes in the status of riparian and riverine wetland plant communities.  Monitoring via the use of airborne sensors may be an effective approach for reducing data acquisition costs, increasing the spatial coverage of data acquisition (i.e., relative to sole reliance on ground-based sampling techniques), and reducing resource impacts associated with ground-based monitoring of upland soil conditions in landscapes where fragile biological soil crusts are prevalent.  The purpose of this project is to evaluate the utility, costs and benefits of different approaches for long-term aerial monitoring of corridors and other targeted, focal areas within NPS units. The evaluation primarily will focus on aspects of the change-detection process that pertain to the repeated acquisition, processing, and classification of fine-scale airborne imagery for purposes of change detection.  An underlying assumption of this project is that it will be too expensive (and probably ineffective) to monitor changes in fine-scale features with high-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Ikonos or Quick-Bird).  Thus the scope of this project is restricted to an evaluation of sensors that can be mounted on airborne platforms that can be directed along specific flight paths.  The desired outcome of this project is a report that provides NPS with sufficient information so that a decision may be made concerning the approach that will best meet the budgetary constraints and integrated monitoring needs of the NCPN program.    The supplier should be familiar with both the remote sensing technologies mentioned above, their costs and abilities, and the unique conditions of Colorado Plateau ecosystems in regard to their impacts on remote sensing data (particularly, sparse vegetation and the resulting impact of soils and geology on analyses of the data, and occurrence of abundant biological soil crusts specific expertise necessary to accomplish this work. The supplier should also have experience and knowledge concerning the application of fine-resolution remote-sensing technologies to assessment and monitoring of riparian and dryland ecosystems of the Colorado Plateau.  In particular, this project requires field- and lab-based knowledge of the effects of geology and bare-soil exposures on surface reflectance properties captured in remotely sensed imagery and on the ability of image-processing techniques to differentiate surface features of the Colorado Plateau region.    The estimated price range is $25,000 to $100,000.     The tentative issue date for this procurement is November of 2004.     The Project & Contracting Office is looking for the following information:     (1) Description of specialized experience in performing work similar in scope to that which is contemplated; (2) a list of present projects, as well as projects performed in the last three (3) years that are of a similar nature to work contemplated (please describe scope and size of project.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/Langley Research Center to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the Internet, and solicit responses from interested parties.  This document is for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their capabilities, to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirements, as well as promote competition.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions via electronic transmission (i.e. e-mail) to: Liliana J. Richwine at liliana.j.richwine@nasa.gov, no later than Oct 25, 2004 at 4:00 pm E.S.T .  When responding reference RFI-NNL04ACDT. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI.  However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating the Conceptual Design Shop implementation strategy which may include competitive procurements in selected areas. Background:   Conceptual Design Shop (CDS) resides within the Efficient Aerodynamic Shapes and Integration (EASI) project under NASA’s Vehicle Systems Program.  The objective of the CDS is to establish a rapid variable fidelity numerical capability for developing and evaluating novel aircraft concepts and component vehicle technologies in a conceptual design environment.	CDS is envisioned to be an integrated software system for rapid conceptual design of flight vehicles that represent the next generation of revolutionary, unconventional aircraft configurations.	This new generation of vehicles will greatly increase mobility by utilizing advanced drag reduction and high lift technologies while protecting the environment through low noise and low emissions technology advances.  These advanced technologies will be developed within the Vehicle Systems Program at NASA or elsewhere in the aerospace industry.  Current conceptual design practice as applied to unconventional configurations is unacceptably time consuming and laborious using today's processes and methods.  CDS will serve to re-vitalize the conceptual design capability at LaRC, supporting the critical sizing and early configuration trade studies of unconventional designs that constitute the foundation of new program efforts and provide guidance for the investment of scarce resources.   RFI Requirements:  The development of CDS will be guided by requirements that have been generated by the CDS customers and stakeholders.  These requirements have been prioritized and white papers are requested that address the focus areas identified by this initial requirements set.	Listed below are the key focus areas and brief descriptions of the desired capabilities in each area.	White papers that examine one or more of these areas are invited.  White papers should be consistent with the separately attached Draft CDS Scope Document (dated August 10, 2004). Key Focus Areas: Variable Fidelity Framework – An engineering framework implementation is needed that can integrate both legacy and new aircraft conceptual design software modules.  The framework must be flexible and facilitate a modular plug-and-play environment that enables the direct integration of higher fidelity codes.  Initial variable fidelity capability is targeted for the aerodynamics and structures disciplines.  Specific needs in these areas are subsonic transport class configuration (both conventional and unconventional) takeoff and landing aerodynamic analysis, subsonic transport drag build-up including the transonic regime, and subsonic transport structural weight estimation. Geometry and Structural Layout – A user-friendly adaptable and expandable interface is needed that enables rapid creation and high fidelity visualization of aircraft geometry.  The tool must generate exportable CAD-grade geometry for high fidelity aerodynamic meshing tools and finite-element analysis and meshing code at all fidelity levels, yet remain easy to use and intuitive for the conceptual designer by utilizing a parametric based geometry interface.  In addition the parametric geometry representation should enable seamless linking with sizing and performance codes for real-time updates. Noise and Emissions – A capability is needed to perform both conceptual-level and higher levels of fidelity of aircraft noise assessments, including an automatic noise prediction capability for non-expert users.  The emissions capability should quantify the	level of harmful emissions from aircraft propulsion systems, including the incorporation of a physics based combustion simulation tool that can generate NOx, CO2, aerosol and particulate emissions automatically for any mission segment. Stability and Control – A capability is needed to perform conceptual-level stability and control (S&C) assessments, including static and dynamic stability, and ride and handling quality metrics.  This capability should translate expert-level metrics into readable information for the non-expert conceptual design user. Uncertainty Methods – A capability is needed to quantify the impact of multidisciplinary uncertainty on vehicle design and performance.	Areas of interest include uncertainty propagation, probabilistic decomposition and probabilistic design. Knowledge Database – A knowledge database is needed for advanced conceptual design that can be easily accessed by the conceptual designer to examine past development on similar advanced concepts.  This database could identify past "show stoppers" and direct an optimization process in those directions to establish current viability or areas of concentration.	The database would incorporate a robust search capability, and contain a wide variety of data, including expert guidance obtained from interviews with experience aircraft conceptual designers, tool and methods documentation, input/output files, and titles of reference papers and reports.  The database should have a web interface to enable wide access. Website – A conceptual design shop website is needed to organize and distribute the conceptual design information developed under this project.  The website must be secure and link user privileges to login ID.  General aircraft design expertise along with web development capabilities are desired for this focus area. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited.   Multi-disciplined review teams that draw on CDS customers and stakeholders from relevant NASA Centers will review the white papers.  Review teams may be comprised of Government personnel from NASA Centers, and/or other Government agencies and may include Swales Aerospace, a NASA LaRC support contractor under the Systems Analysis contract.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Propulsion Subsystem Fill and Drain Valves.  The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work for SDO Project Propulsion Subsystem Fill and Drain Valves (464-PROP-LEGL-0049), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification for Propulsion Subsystem Fill and Drain Valves (464-PROP-SPEC-0088), and Exhibit 3 – SDO Project Propulsion Subsystem Fill and Drain Valves Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS). This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements and its acquisition approach.

STATEMENT O F WORK:  Automated Media Monitoring and Research System (AMMARS).  Overview:  A system is required to provide rapid access to and analysis of Arabic Language Television News broadcasts immediately, and additional languages in the future.  Technology is now  available to support automated capture and analysis of video in near real-time.  Such a system based on this technology will accelerate staff access to the content of television broadcasts.  The Automated Media Monitoring and Research System (AMMARS) will  need to provide this capability.  System Description:  The Automated Media Monitoring and Research System (AMMARS) will provide the ability to capture six television signals in digital format and enable analysts to review up to 30 days of video using a st andard web browser.  The system will include alerting by keywords, full-text search in Arabic or English, and phonetic audio search in Arabic.  The system will enable rapid analysis of the content to view graphically the temporal occurrence of topics or ke ywords within one or all channels.  The system will provide automatic highlighting of Arabic text to mark entities including people, places, organizations, and dates and times.  Video segments will include an indication of unique, known speakers using spea ker indentification (ID).  The system will support continuous recording on each of the six channels with near real-time access to the video, speech-recognized text, highlighted entities, machine translation to English, and speaker ID, with less than 10 min utes latency.  Users must be able to select segments of video for export to Powerpoint or Word, along with text transcripts in Arabic and machine-language trans lations to English.  The system shall provide six key capabilities for personnel:  1.  Review streaming video with synchronized transcriptions and translations.  2.  Selection of video segments by source and time.  3.  Search for specific spoken content in  the video cache by Arabic- or English-language text query.  4.  Create watch lists that trigger real-time alerts when specific content is detected.  5.  Export video segments to external documents and presentations.  6.  Provide graphical temporal display  of the occurrence of topics or keywords within the video cache.  The current requirements are that the system shall include all television signal reception and distribution capabilities to support  24x7 monitoring of the following channels:  Al Jazeera, A l Arabiya, Al-Manar, Al-Alam, Al Iraqiya, Alhurrah.  Customer Functional Requirements:  The section provides a detailed description of the functional requirements of the system.  Review Streaming Video:  From the web-based UI, users can review live broadca st channels in real time along with a synchronized transcript in the source language and its automatic translation into English.  The synchronized playback of video and text shall not lag the live signal capture time by more than 10 minutes.  Similarly, an y segment of recorded video in the dynamic cache shall be viewable in the web-based UI in synchrony with its transcription and translation.  The appearance of synchronized playback in the UI shall be the same for both recorded video segments and for live v ideo streams.  In both forms of playback, the word being spoken shall be highlighted in the transcript.  Review Video Segments:  Users shall be able to select video segments for review by specifying a channel and a start time.  The web-based UI shall offer  a menu of channels to select from as well as a calendar that covers the span of time accounted for in each dynamic video cache.  During the synchronized playback of a video segment, users shall have random access into the segment.  The UI shall permit the  user to click on any word in the transcript or any sentence in the translation to begin playing from that point.  Review Still Frames:  Users shall select still frames by simply clicking on a word in the textual transcript while the media player is in the  pause mode.  A still frame shall be retrieved from the video cache that corresponds to the start time of the selected word.   Search Video for Content:  Users shall be able to search for specific spoken content in the video cache by submitting keyword que ries to the web-based UI.  Arabic or English language queries shall be supported.  Boolean operators shall be provided with the search facility as well as capabilities for specifying phrases or substring matches to word stems with arbitrary endings.  Users  shall be able to restrict their searches to specific channels and intervals of time.  Focus Cues:  When a video segment is retrieved by means of a keyword search, the query terms in the transcript or translation shall be highlighted wherever they occur to  draw the attention of the user.  When the retrieved video segment is first selected from the results of a search, the segment shall be positioned just before the first keyword in the transcript or translation text.  The web-based UI shall allow the user t o easily skip from one focus cue (keyword or phrase) to another in either direction with a single mouse click.  Export Video Segments:  Users shall be able to export arbitrary video segments of their choosing to Microsoft PowerPoint slides.  Users shall be  able to specify the segment to be exported by designating the first and last word in the segment from the automatic transcript, or the first and last sentence from the automatic translation.  The video segment shall be then saved to a PowerPoint file alon g with the automatic transcript and translation.  The user shall specify the name and location of this file through the standard Windows Save As dialog.  Expo rt Still Frames and Metadata:  Users shall be able to export still frames of their choosing to Microsoft PowerPoint slides or Word Documents.  Users shall be able to specify the still frame to be exported by selecting the corresponding word in the transcri pt.   Similarly, users shall be able to export arbitrary selections of the textual transcript and corresponding translation to presentations or documents.  Any number of metadata exports can be made to the receiving file in any order.  Synchronized Playbac k in Exported Video Segments:  Exported segments of video and metadata from the system into Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or Internet Explorer shall preserve their internal synchronization during playback of the video segment.  Just as in the web-based UI, t he corresponding words in the transcript and the sentences in the translation shall be highlighted as they are spoken during video playback.  Alerts from Keyword-based Filters:  Users may elect to have keyword search queries to be saved as filters to be ap plied against all incoming transcriptions or translations.  When a saved keyword query matches words spoken on any channel being monitored by the system, an alert shall be posted to the UI and the video segment surrounding the match is queued for review by  users at any time later.   Arabic-Language Phonetic Audio Search:  The system shall automatically index Arabic language audio phonetically to support phonetic audio search.  Arabic-language text search strings shall result in a list of audio clips with hi gh probability of the occurrence of a phonetic audio match.  A confidence score shall provide an indication of the general probability of a phonetic match of a specified audio clip to the search string.  The system must be capable of supporting languages o ther than Arabic, when required, recognizing that additional software will be necessary for the system to operate in any language that may be required.  Content Analysis:  Using phonetic audio search results, the system shall provide users with the ability  to analyze content by channel and time span to graphically depict the occurrence of key words, phrases, and topics.  UPS Option:  The system shall optionally provide for UPS backup to support the orderly shutdown of servers in the event of a power outage.   Digital Video Recorder Option:  The system shall optionally provide for video-only recording of the six channels for a period of 48 hours in the event of a system or power outage. INSTRUCTIONS & EVALUATION:  The Government will evaluate offers and make a Best Value selection in accordance with listed criteria.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. Factor 1:  Technical Capability/Understanding of the Requirements:  Both the offerors understanding of the specific requirements and the overall scope of work required and the offerors demonstrated technical capability.  The product description and techn ical literature must describe a product that will meet all the performance requirements contained in the Statement of Work.   Factor 2:  Past Performance:  Offerors performance on three past federal and/or commercial contracts within the last three years, plus additional recent relevant information provided by the offerors for consideration. This evaluation will consider timelin ess of delivery, customer satisfaction and product performance consistant with that as advertised.   Factor 3:  Price:  Not adjectivally rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination.   Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:  OUTSTANDING  Very comprehensive, in-depth, clear response.  Offer meets this standard with no omissions.  High quality performance c an be expected.   EXCELLENT  Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or sp ottiness.  High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.  GOOD -  No deficiencies in the response.  Better than acceptable performance can be expected, but in som e significant areas, there is an unevenness or spottiness that might impact performance.   FAIR  The response generally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance.  Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor i mpact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.  POOR  The response fails to meet one or more requirements.  Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without maj or revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.    UNACCEPTABLE  Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas.  The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions.  The proposa l only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so.  Only vague indications of the required capability are present.  Your firms submission should reflect a nd demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

The current reactor in over 40 years old and was originally manufactured and installed at AFRRI by General Atomics.  Because much of the assembly components are believed to be proprietary, the Government believes that General Atomics is the only company capable of performing the required work.   However, all interested parties may respond and their offers will be considered.  This is a one-time sole-source procurement for the commercially available supplies, equipment and services to accomplish this requirement.   This notice serves as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemental and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation number is RFQ-R8-04-13.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  The applicable Standard Industrial Classification 2879 and size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Forest Services is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item no. (1a) – Glyphosate 4#/gallon (no surfactant) 1125 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1b) Glyphosate 5.4#/gallon (no surfactant) 840 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1c) a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of a.e. (4500 lbs).  Item no. (2) – Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 750 gallons (2.5 gallon container, 2 per per box).  Item no. (3) – Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (4 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 275 gallons (1 quart container, 4 per box).  Item no. (4) – Arsenal (2 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 550 gallons (1 quart container, 4 per box).  Item no. (5) Triclopyr amine (3# a.e./gal in water solution) 1650 gallons or equivalent amount of a.e. (4900 lbs ai) in alternative formulations (2.5 gal containers - 2 per box).  Item no. (6) Triclopyr ester (4# a.e./gal) 1775 gallons or equivalent amount of a.e. (7100# a.e.) in alternative formulation (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box).   Products 2-4 are product specific (to meet Environment Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements), and package sizes are specific to meet desired storage and safety standards during use. While other products or packaging is available they are unacceptable due to either to regulatory or safety constraints.  
Products 1a and lb are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed working for the quote would be "Glyphosate as a solution in water without surfactant – 4500 lbs a.i. as either 1125 gallons of a 4# a.i./gal formulation, 840 gallons of a 5.4 lb a.i./gal formulation, or a combination of the two formulation weights resulting in a total weight of a.i. of 4500 lbs (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box). Must be labeled for forestry use."  Quoters may submit a quote on Items 1a, lb or lc.   (Separate listings are given to allow purchase of existing 4#a.i../gal stock or to procure appropriate 5.4# a.i./gal products).  
Product 5 is triclopyr amine formulated in water solution.  A total of 1650 galls of the 3# a.e./gallon formulations (traditional formulation = 4900 lbs a.e.) is estimated for need.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in any product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
Product 6 is triclopyr ester formulated in appropriate solution (and potentially including surfactant).  A total of 1775 gallons of the 4# a.e./gal formulation (traditional formulation = 7100 lbs a.e.) is estimated as needed.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at contractor's expense.

 Line Item No. 0001 MULTIBEAM SONAR MAPPING (LUMP SUM) ___________________.  
The contractor shall conduct the Multibeam Sonar Mapping in accordance with the following SOW.     
C.1  SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide all items necessary (i.e. equipment, tools,
supplies, labor, etc) to map a corridor of the west Florida shelf  between the Steamboat Lumps gag grouper protection area and the area known as Twin Ridges and along the 74-m isobath (Figure 1)  (Figure 1 may be obtained at the following website.  www.casc.noaa.gov.  On the left side of the home page, click on Acquisition.  When CASC Acquisition Home Page opens, click on Solicitations Announcements Link in left column of page.  This will bring you to our solicitation documents.  Figure 1 will be under IFB No. WC1330-04-RB-0018.)    
C.2  BACKGROUND
To effectively manage and conserve coral reef resources in the Southeastern U.S. (including the U.S. Caribbean), there is a need to first determine how much Coral Reef habitat exists.  Uniform mapping provides a means for accomplishing this task.  In the southeast, many coral reef areas remain unmapped, including deep reef habitats (deeper than 20m) that are likely to experience heavier fishing pressure as shallow areas become depleted and experience increased stress from coastal populations.  Effective habitat characterization also needs detailed topography of reef habitats.  Mapped areas are often not sufficiently detailed to address conservation issues.  The most useful maps for identifying and studying essential and critical habitat are high resolution multibeam maps.  Typical multibeam systems use 110-150 narrowly spaced acoustic beams that record depths of very discrete portions of the ocean floor.  The use of multibeam mapping equipment allows precise location of benthic topographic reef features over large areas at relatively high rates of speed. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, there is a zone of deep-water reefs that extend from the mid and outer shelf of Mississippi, Alabama, Florida panhandle, and along the west Florida shelf.  These geological features have been described as reefs, rocky ridges and pinnacles, and are located at shelf depths between 60 m and 180 m of water.  The rocky ridges and pinnacles were formed during the last sea level stand down about 15,000 years ago.  These features represent important habitat for reef fish.  The Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council recognized the importance of geological setting when they established the Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps Gag Grouper Protected Areas in 1999.   The Gulf Council is now considering the establishment of additional seasonal closures in the region between Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps.  Mapping of this area, known as the Edges, is critical prior to the establishment of closure boundaries.
C.3  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The Contractor shall complete the survey described below and provide all data products to (NMFS) project representative by September 20, 2005.  The NMFS project representative will be identified at contract award.
C.4  SPECIFICATION FOR DATA COLLECTION:
	a.  The Contractor shall conduct the mapping using a multibeam sonar system that will collect high-resolution swath bathymetry and acoustic backscatter of the sea bed.  This mapped corridor shall be 4 nautical miles (7.4 km) in width.  The total region to be mapped is approximately 240 square nautical miles (60 nautical miles by 4 nautical miles).

	b.  The seafloor depth measurements shall have an accuracy of 15 cm RMS.  Depth measurements shall account for tidal changes and reduce the bathymetry to a Mean Sea Level (MSL).  
	c.  The positional accuracy be with one (1) Meter.
	d.  The size of the bathymetry grid depends on water depth (due to beam spreading).  The required grid spacing shall be 5 m by 5 m in waters greater than 100 m and 50 cm by 50 cm in 10 meters water depth, i.e., about 5% of water depth. 
C.5  SPECIFICATION FOR DATA PRODUCTS:
a.  The Contractor shall process data to clean bathymetry, including flagging (i.e., retaining but not displaying) data points that are returns from sea grass, fish, dolphins, whales, and other material in the water.   The Contractor shall also clean navigation data and flag any bad data. 
b.  The Contractor shall process the bathymetry data for the backscatter response by removing the effects of NADIR (the strong return below the sonar) and providing a relatively uniform type of backscatter response to provide insight and qualitative information regarding the bottom type (sediment, rock, and biology).   
c.  The Contractor shall provide the data in full resolution xyz ASCII format, as well as a free fledermuas product that allows for 3-D viewing, and an ESRI formatted data file for downloading into ARC VIEW/GIS software. 
d.  The Contractor shall also provide metadata to detail survey and processing information.

<SUBJECT>B -- School Leadership Program Grantee Project Evaluations
<SOLNBR>eeud0403
<RESPDATE>090904
<ARCHDATE>09242004
<CONTACT>Jay Zagursky, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6132, Fax 202-245-6297, Email Jay.Zagursky@ed.gov
<DESC>The purpose of the proposed contract is to assist the Department of Education (ED) to review and provide technical assistance to the School Leadership Program (SLP) grantees on their project evaluations. More specifically, the contractor will work with ED to review the SLP evaluation frameworks, and to design a format for bringing the grantees together to hear about and discuss their approaches to developing their evaluation methodologies, what they learned from the process, their expectations for the value and use of the evaluation results, and provide technical assistance support to strengthen those evaluations. This effort will provide an opportunity to capitalize on the experiences and lessons learned from the participants to inform the current as well as future SLP program evaluations.

The School Leadership Program grants support projects that develop, enhance or expand programs to recruit, train and mentor assistant principals and principals for high-need school districts. Grant awards assist local education agencies (LEAs) in partnership with other entities to develop, document, evaluate and disseminate innovative, cohesive models of preparation of and support for assistant principals and principals. These programs combine active recruitment of diverse and talented individuals, a rigorous selection process, high-quality coursework in instructional and managerial leadership with internships and mentor support to increase the quality and quantity of school leaders for rural and urban schools. For additional information about the SLP program, please visit the program web site at http://www.ed.gov/programs/leadership/index.html.

As a result of the FY 2002 SLP grant competition, 24 projects were funded. Twenty (20) of the grantees will begin the 3rd year, and 4 will begin the 2nd year of their grants on October 1, 2004. While the application for the SLP grants included a requirement to conduct an evaluation of their programs, grantees were given flexibility in the framing and implementation of those evaluations.  While this made some sense given that grantees were implementing a variety of approaches to recruiting, training and support school leaders, the result is a wide range of evaluation designs across the 24 grants. ED is seeking a better understanding of the approaches and strategies used by the grantees to develop their evaluation methodologies and questions, and to engage them in a discussion of their outcomes and how to best use and disseminate them. To do that, ED is proposing to bring together the grantees and their evaluators with others engaged in similar efforts together to hear how they framed their evaluations—successes and challenges--and, their perceptions of how the results may be used to enhance our knowledge of the effectiveness of practices to develop school leaders. Participants will also be asked to provide suggestions or recommendations on the types of technical assistance support that would be most helpful to them and others developing evaluations for similar projects or programs. 

The contractor would provide assistance to ED in four areas by 1) reviewing and preparing an overview report of SLP evaluation frameworks, 2) providing technical expertise in framing and developing the meeting content and format, 3) assisting with logistical arrangements for the meeting, and 4) preparing a summary report of the meeting outcomes with recommendations for technical assistance strategies for current and future grantees on the design and implementation of project evaluations. ED estimates that approximately 50 project directors and evaluators will attend the meeting as well as up to an additional 50 other participants including ED staff and others from organizations and foundations engaged in school leadership efforts. It is expected that all participants will be responsible for their own travel expenses.

ED will give preference to bidders who demonstrate the following expertise and experience:

Preference for a contractor that previous experience in working with or conducting research on school leadership programs; 

Preference for a contractor that has previous experience in designing and conducting program evaluations; and,

Preference for a contractor that has previous experience conducting and facilitating meetings. 

The deliverables are described below:

Task 1: Prepare a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the 24 SLP grantee evaluation frameworks (will be provided to the contractor within five days of the contract award.) 

The contractor shall prepare an overview of the 24 grantees' evaluation designs. The report will provide information to ED on commonalities across the evaluation methodologies and questions, and on how the information may be used to inform meeting with grantees and their evaluators. 

Deliverables: 5-10 page report.

Task 2: Design and develop a meeting agenda and format that proposes outcomes, based on the review conducted in Task 1, that includes 1) Meeting expectations and outcomes; 2) A framework and/or set of key questions to structure the meeting discussion; 3) A process and format for engaging participants; 4) Suggested speakers and/or facilitators; and 5) A process for documenting the outcomes.

Deliverables: 1) Agenda; 2) Outline of Meeting Content and Materials; 3) Description of Meeting Format; 4) List of Proposed Facilitators and Speakers.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Loading Dock
<SOLNBR>FA4877-04-Q-0505
<RESPDATE>083104
<ARCHDATE>09152004
<CONTACT>Romeo Reyes, Contract Specialist, Phone 520-228-2214, Fax 520-228-5284, Email romeo.reyes@dm.af.mil
<DESC>Below are 13 questions and answers concerning this requirmenet.  Be advised that the closing date for responses/proposals has changed to 31 Aug 04.  

1.  The capacity is stated as 50,000 lbs. Is this a distributed or concentrated load? If it is a concentrated load, what is the foot plate dimension and the point load per wheel on the rolling stock?  Answer: We believe it will be distributed, the only thing we will use it for is the loading of rolling stock (items with wheels).

2.  The sol. indicates that assembly is required by the receiving unit. Does this mean that the supplier of the dock is not responsible for the assembly?  Answer:  The Govt plans on assembling the unit however would be interested in seeing two quotes, one for assembled and one for un-assembled.
 
3.  What would be the distance between the truck bed end and the dock for purposes of the hinged bridge plates and would these be required for the sixty foot width?  Answer:  The K Loader will back up against the dock, thus the reason for the bridge plates. The plates will enable us to drive or move anything we need to load off of the dock onto the bed of the K Loader. As for the hinging of the plates, this saves us from having to pick up and move the plates when not in use, with hinges we can just flip up or down.

4.  Is there a picture or drawing available of the K loader? Answer:  A Picture of K Loader can be found at.http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/tunner.htm

5.  Will this be a permanent installation when assembled?  Answer:  This will not be a permanent installation, if needed we want to be able to disassemble and move the structure.

6.  What type of surface will the dock be assembled on and will be able to anchor to it?  Answer: This will be assembled on an asphalt surface, no need to anchor as it's not going to be permanent.
 
7.  A finish was not specified for this ramp. Should it be painted, galvanized, etc.?  Answer:  Shall be painted Silver or Gray.

8. Are the measurements on the ramp 60' wide X 100' long or is it 60" wide X 100' long ? Answer:    60' wide, 100' long

9. Do you need the adjustable end that is in the picture, to raise it up and down.  Answer:  The 48” high truck bed end does not need to be adjustable, also the safety rail has to be on the ramp as well.

TRUCK BED HEIGHT IS STATIC AT 48”, BRIDGE PLATES NEED TO BE HINGED SO THEY CAN LAY FLAT WHEN DOWN AND STICK STRAIT UP IN THE AIR WHEN POSITION K-LOADER.

7 EA HINGED BRIDGE PLATES 88” WIDE SPACED ACROSS TRUCK BED END.

10.  We would like to know the size wheels utilized on the rolling stock, the reason for this information is that bar grating comes in various spacing of the bearing bars, as close as 1/2" and as far apart as 1 11/16". Naturally, small wheel dollies and etc. move along easier on grating with closer bearing bars, The width of the wheels has a little bearing on the bar spacing also.   Answer:  Capable of moving a 50,000 lb piece of equipment that has 4 tires with a contact area as small as 10", this would mean the area would have to support 12,500.  As for the adjustable end, if the MAX height of the ramp is built to 48" we would not need the end to be adjustable.
1 VEHICLE 50K GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT = 1 TIRE @ 10" CONTACT AREA @ 12,500 POUNDS PER TIRE X 4 TIRES = 50,000 POUNDS
THERE WILL BE STANDS THAT HAVE 1” WHEEL CONTACT SO GRATING WILL HAVE TO BE 1/2” OR LESS

11.	The contractor asked, since the with is only going to be 100 inches is there a need for gaps between the plates.  Need to know how you would like these plates laid out.   Answer:  The width does need to be  88 inches, we need these to be able to lay down flat in the rails of the kloader. As for the spacing, if there are plates on each end, the rest of the spacing does not matter but we do need them the whole ramp length.
7 EA HINGED BRIDGE PLATES 88” WIDE SPACED ACROSS TRUCK BED END

12.	What is the max. gross weight of any one vehicle to operate on this system? Answer: 
1 VEHICLE 50K GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT = 1 TIRE @ 10" CONTACT AREA @ 12,500 POUNDS PER TIRE X 4 TIRES = 50,000 POUNDS

13.  Is the system 50K gross weight? or 50K gross vehicle weight? Answer:
1 VEHICLE 50K GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT = 1 TIRE @ 10" CONTACT AREA @ 12,500 POUNDS PER TIRE X 4 TIRES = 50,000 POUNDS

(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>Questions and Answers



1) Question:   

No digital of each image is requested. Since many of the NARA images 
are now being made available online would it be of interest to have a 
20MB 8x10 digital made at the same time?

Reply:  

No, The purpose of this solicitation is to provide preservation copies of these images not make them available online in digital form.  

RFQ Change:  None


2) Question:  

 Can we come to NARA II and do the shoot there? We are a local firm. 
That would mean less handling of the originals (and less risk of loss).

Reply:    

The images are located in the Regional Archives in Anchorage, AK, not   Archives II.  Our preference is to ship the images directly to the contractor.

RFQ Change:  None
