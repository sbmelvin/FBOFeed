<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the modification of 2 hydraulic servo actuators (1 elevator hydraulic and 1 rudder hydraulic).  These actuators will be used on the NASA LaRC B-757 Airborne Research Integrated Experiments Systems (ARIES).  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  Moog Inc, Aircraft Group, East Aurora, New York.	 Moog Inc, Aircraft Group is the sole supplier of servo actuators to Boeing 757-200 aircraft.   They are the only known possible source and no other source is capable of satisfying the agency's requirement. NASA LaRC has determined that the standard servo actuators normally installed in a 757-200 airplane are not suitable for use with the Aft Flight Deck (AFD) configuration.  The modified servo actuators that are to be supplied by Moog Inc, will increase authority and provide more accurate monitoring to meet AFD requirements.  A new design is not acceptable because of compatibility, reliability, quality and flight safety issues of a new design. In addition, it would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to generate a new design and these cost are expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 14, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Zero Boil-Off Demonstration Liquid Nitrogen Pump System Specifications for Zero Boil-Off Demonstration Liquid Nitrogen Pump System   This document describes the specifications for a pump system to be used for destratificaton of liquid nitrogen in a 639ft3 cryogenic storage vessel . The pump system shall consist of a pump, motor, cables, power supply, and controller. Background The Zero-Boil Off Demonstration (ZBO Demo) is an experiment to be conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The demonstration is to show that stored cryogenic fluids can be cooled by a heat removal system consisting of a LN2 pump, flow-meter spray-bar heat exchanger, and Joule Thompson / Visco-jet.   At the bottom of the vessel, the LN2 pump is to be mounted with its flow directed across the flow meter and up the spray-bar/heat exchanger. The flow is also to be directed across the Visco jet/Joule Thompson expansion valve, to initiate heat removal. The flow momentum, when it reaches the surface, needs to be great enough to penetrate the surface and mix with the vapor.  Operating Conditions The pump, motor, and cables which are internal to the vessel, shall satisfy the design requirements under the following: Environmental conditions Media: Liquid Nitrogen, Liquid Hydrogen and vacuum Minimum Temperature: 20K Maximum Temperature: 300K Maximum Pressure: 20PSID Minimum Pressure: 1x10 -6 Torr Nominal flow conditions Fluid: Liquid Nitrogen Inlet temperature: 81K Delta pressure: 10-20 PSID Pump Inlet/Exit diameter: 2 inches Nominal flow rate: 30.0 GPM Variable flow rate: 10 GPM to 40.0 GPM Pressure rise across pump: 10.0 ft *The materials and electrical components of the motor, pump and cables need to be compatible with use in liquid hydrogen but the flow rates are to be based on operation in liquid nitrogen.   Design Requirements 1.        The centrifugal pumping system shall be designed for intermittent and continuous operation. a.  Typical intermittent operation will consist of being on, at any flow rate within the operating range, for 2 minutes followed by being off for 20 minutes.  b.   Typical continuous operation will consists of operation at any flow rate in the operating range for periods up to 80 hours with a total operating life greater than 10,000 hours. 2.

<RESPDATE>033103
<ARCHDATE>03052004
<CONTACT>Anna M. Brown Contract Specialist 7037871369     Anna.Brown@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CARFULLY.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The US Interior Department sells oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico by means of recurring sealed-bid auctions.  The Deepwater Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) mandated royalty suspension in significant amounts for deepwater leases sold from 1996 to 2000, and when that provision expired, the Interior Department continued the program, with detailed changes to the incentives, on a sale-by-sale basis.  The overall purpose of this requirement is to assess the actual effects of the program to date and to apply what is learned toward designing royalty incentives.  The work is divided into two tasks.  Task 1, "Actual effects of the royalty relief program," is distinguished by a focus on data on actual historical leasing and exploration activities for the Gulf of Mexico.  For Task 1, econometric analysis of auction results and lessee activity to date is required, and it includes testing statistically for significance of the royalty relief program as explanatory factor.  Other possible explanatory variables include technology progress and perceptions of resource potential.  In Task 2, "Projection of fiscal effects of alternative program designs," the contractor shall make projections of future effects of four specific, alternative cases; the cases vary in amounts of royalty suspension offered at leases. The contractor will propose the projection method, not necessarily econometric, for Task 2.   The work will involve meeting with MMS staff in Herndon, VA, and New Orleans, LA.  INTRODUCTION:  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract for service.  The period of performance shall be no more than 12 months from the effective date of the contract.  The estimated cost range is between $200,000 and $250,000.   HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, by Monday, March 31, 2003 an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: (a) your past performance, including ability to complete projects on time, control costs, and with high quality; and (b) the scientific and technical persons you will have working on the project, explaining the parts of the project they will work on and their areas of expertise.  (c) a committed Program Manager with sufficient management experience and resources and ability to plan work schedules to ensure successful and timely completion of the project.  Offerors shall provide specific reference (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel is currently performing or has completed within the last five (5) years.  References will be checked.  Qualifications of any subcontractors or partners will also be considered in these respects.   EVALUATION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENT: Your capabilities statement will be evaluated on the basis of these considerations:  (A) Past Performance -- ability to complete projects on time, adhere to schedules and budgets, control costs, and make products of high quality, whether past projects worked on are comparable to this contract project, including complexity and size, and how well you as an organization and the key persons who will work on this project cooperated with past clients.  (B) Scientific and Technical Personnel -- We will consider personnel proposed on each task separately.   Task 1 includes rigorous and expert statistical investigation.  For Task 1, particularly relevant is expertise in: collecting and managing data for statistical analysis; econometric analysis generally; quantitative modeling of sealed-bid auctions such as the oil and gas lease sale; interpretation of resource assessments; oil industry and land economics generally.  For Task 2, particularly relevant is expertise in: modeling oil and gas supply; making projections of oil and gas discoveries, production, and revenues.  SUBMISSION OF STATEMENT:  Please send the original and four (4) copies to Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170-4817, Attn: Anna M. Brown.  Questions regarding this procurement should be faxed or emailed as soon as possible to 703-787-1022 or anna.brown@mms.gov.  Please include with your questions your full name, the RFP number (71722) & title (Effects of Royalty Incentives for Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Leases), your organization, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<SUBJECT>B--Mitigation of Oil Industry Operations on Driftnet Fishing in Cook Inlet
<SOLNBR>71847
<RESPDATE>032703
<ARCHDATE>03052004
<CONTACT>Anna M. Brown Contract Specialist 7037871369     Anna.Brown@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled "Mitigation of Oil Industry Operations on Driftnet Fishing in Cook Inlet" for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  The offeror must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be six (6) months with an estimated cost range of $150,000 to $175,000.  The period of performance must cover the month of July, since that is the peak season for driftnet "openers" when critical data must be collected. The timeline for this project is based on the assumption that contracted work will begin by June of 2003.  Introduction: The prospect of new offshore oil and gas development in Cook Inlet of Southcentral Alaska presents some potential for conflict with local fishermen, especially the commercial driftnet fishery. Seasonal placement of stationary drilling rigs could create obstacles where fishermen typically drift their long nets. In particular, drift gillnet fishermen (drifters) often focus their efforts near turbulent rip tides because salmon are known to concentrate in these areas. The presence of an oil platform in favorable fishing areas would pose a navigational obstacle that could result in diminished access, loss of harvest resulting from premature net release, or gear entanglement. Thus, in the past drifters have opposed offshore oil development and have recommended the exclusion of popular driftnet locations from MMS lease sales. Without improved mitigation, such issues may provide a source of delay in the proposed schedule of MMS offshore lease sales or post-lease reviews.  This study intends to explore and define specific ways to mitigate these potential conflicts and to analyze the significant tradeoffs of reasonable alternative proposals. It will also place the analysis within the broader social context of key dynamic variables, such as recent changes in fishing markets, fishing regulations, fishing technology, navigational safety, oil markets, oil technology, and the history of relations and linkages between fishing and oil industry sectors in the region.  This study will develop specific and practical proposals to mitigate or resolve potential spatial conflicts between fishermen and the oil industry in the federal waters of Cook Inlet. These potential conflicts include, but are not limited to: navigational safety issues, gear entanglement and damage issues, and loss of harvest issues. The study will proceed to analyze and evaluate various alternative proposals according to their social and economic and ecological implications for the region. A final recommendation will emerge from the fieldwork, data collection, and analysis that will be presented to relevant stakeholders for further comment and refinement. It is expected that the final study product will be used to inform future decision-making processes at MMS and within the fish and oil industries.  These overarching goals will be accomplished through the following intermediary objectives:  1.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command intends to negotiate with Smiths Detection-Edgewood, Inc. in Edgewood, Maryland, on a non-competitive basis (per FAR 6.302-1) for a new indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to obtain consuma bles and stockpile materials for the Biological Detectors (BDs) that were developed and produced by Smiths Detection-Edgewood, Inc. and integrated into the fielded Pre-Planned Product Improvement Biological Integrated Detection Systems (P3I BIDS).  The con sumables will consist of reagent assay kits, cleaning kits, 80-frame tape cassette assemblies, maintenance assay kits, cleaning refill kits, agent of biological origin reagent pairs, and BG reagent pairs.  The proposed contract will also provide for stockp iling the following long lead materials:  urea, biotin BSA, polyester and lead tape, and nitrocellulose.  The requirement is being solicited on a non-competitive basis because Smiths Detection-Edgewood, Inc. is the only source that has the capabilities and  expertise required to successfully produce and deliver the BD consumables and stockpile materials needed to replenish the fielded BDs without substantial duplication of costs to the government and within the schedule constraints of the BIDS program.  Oppo rtunities for competitive subcontracting may be present.*****

<DESC>NA TACOM proposes to negotiate a contract for the acquisition of logistics effort for the Tactical Firefighting Truck (TFFT)that is being built on a HEMTT chassis. We plan to acquire manuals and training, to include Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (I ETMs) for the TFFT. We received commercial manuals with these vehicles but the Government needs manuals in Government format that is more suitable for the field's use for maintenance and repair. The repair and maintenance procedures are the same as the HEM TTs and are covered in paper and electronic manuals for that vehicle family. The Government desires to consolidate the TFFT unique components included in the same format as HEMTT vehicle family paper and electronic manuals. Pierce through their unique rela tionship with OTC, who is the only producer of the HEMTT, is the only one who can provide Operator/Maintenance training for the TFFT so that the soldier in the field can be properly trained on the HEMTT as changed by the addition of the fire fighting equip ment components. TACOM plans to procure this effort on a non-competitive basis from Pierce Mfg, a sudsidiary of Oshkosh Truck Corp (OTC) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). See Note 22. The solication will be released to the TACOM website on or about  26 Mar 03.  The offer due date is on or around 11 Apr 03.  No hard copies of solicitation will be issued; you must download it from the TACOM Acq website: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm.

The Rapid Parking Ramp Expansion (RPRE) primary goals are to provide a faster, more transportable means for rapidly expanding parking aprons and taxiways at expeditionary airfields worldwide, and to provide a more expedient method to improve weak soils when appropriate.

Please refer to the System Performance Specification (SPS) and the Statement of Objectives (SOO) for details outlining the performance parameters.  

The intent of this procurement will be to design, develop, produce, and support a replacement for the AM-2 Matting using methods and techniques to implement existing rapid soil stabilization technology or development of a new lightweight airfield mat, or a combination of both.  It will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), contract awarded on a ?Performance? basis.

<DESC>A sole source procurement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 is contemplated with Honeywell Technology Center, Plymouth, MN. (See Numbered Note 22)  Honeywell is the only qualified source to fulfill this requirement. The requirement is for fabrication of one infrared scene projector emitter module (PEM) which is to be compatible with the current cryogenic PEM design used in the Kinetic-Kill-Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop (KHILS) Vacuum Cold Chamber (KVACC) located at the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), Eglin AFB, FL.  This PEM will include a Honeywell Brilliant Resistor Infrared Thermal Emitter II Extended Range (BRITE II ER) 512x512 array; all electrical, coolant, and external vacuum interfaces; and an ion vacuum pump as integral components.  The delivered PEM will be used to support test and evaluation of advanced state-of-the-art seeker and control systems performance under varying mission scenarios through hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulations in a cryogenic environment.  The Government has determined that the Honeywell BRITE II is the only infrared scene projection technology available that fully meets its requirements.  The total effort is not expected to exceed 12 months.  The Government will be responsible for annealing, system installation, and characterization of the delivered array.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Firms interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualifications package, in accordance with Numbered Note 25, describing the company's technical expertise and experience available to accomplish the work described above.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Center San Diego intends to procure on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis from Research Foundation of SUNY in behalf of University at Buffalo, Ste 11, UB Commons, 520 Lee Entrance, Amherst, NY  14228.  The Sole Source is based on  unique capabilities to perform kurtotic noise exposure and extensive knowledge and experience in audiologic physiology and small animal models for testing of pharmacological and toxicologic agents that affect inner ear function.   The following services are required:  CLIN 0001: 12 months ? Provide non-personal services in accordance with the following Statement of Work:   INTRODUCTION: The Department of Defense Spatial Orientation Center of Naval Medical Center, San Diego staff conducts ongoing projects in auditory and vestibular research.  ABREVIATIONS: DOD = Department of Defense, ONR = Office of Naval Research, NMCSD = Naval Medical Center San Diego, SUNY = State University of New York, CRADA = cooperative research and development agreement, GPOC = Government Point of Contact, DSOC = DOD Spatial Orientation Center, AO = antioxidant, ROS = reactive oxygen species, FR = free radicals, NAC = N-acetyl-L-cysteine, ALCAR = acetyl-L-carnitine, IP = intraperitoneally, SPL = sound pressure level, kHz = kilohertz, sec = second, COL = Colonel, MC = Medical Corp, FY = Fiscal Year.  SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into noise-induced hearing loss protection in support of funded investigations under the ONR Military Operational Medicine program and NMCSD local Clinical Investigation Protocol (CIP# S-02-040 ?Prevention of Impulse and Kurtotic Noise Induced Hearing Loss with Antioxidants in a Chinchilla Model?. This program encompasses research into developing countermeasures for the prevention of tissue/organ damage prior to exposures to high-energy sources (loud sounds) and to develop methods for prevention and rescue of neurosensory tissues with exposures to exotic energy sources. This work entails performing a series of experiments over a 12-month period.  AIM: This study will extend our previous noise-induced hearing loss model to impulse noise and kurtotic noise. The investigation entails utilizing the antioxidant (AO) compounds, NAC and ALCAR.  For this series of studies we will investigate the effects of AOs in protecting (prevention) and rescuing (treatment) hearing after exposure to impulse noise and kurtotic noise.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  
SUNY will investigate the effects of AOs in protecting and rescuing hearing after exposure to impulse and kurtotic noise. In the first set of experiments AO protection will be studied using four groups or 24 animals exposed to two noise conditions, impulse (1 control n = 6; 1 ALCAR n = 6) and kurtotic noise (control n = 6; ALCAR n = 6). AOs will be given before and after exposure to noise to investigate protective effects.  In a second set of experiments 6 groups or 36 animals will receive the AO treatment only after exposure to investigate rescue effects using the two noise conditions, impulse (control n = 6; ALCAR n = 6 and NAC n = 6) and kurtotic noise (control n = 6; ALCAR n = 6 and NAC n = 6).  Impulse noise consists of simulated M16 rifle fire (150 dB peak SPL; 100 shots, interval of 1 impulse/sec).  Kurtotic noise consists of continuous octave band noise centered at 4 kHz; 84-86 dB SPL and 113 dB peak SPL applied 1/sec impulse noise 3h duration, replicating occupational noise exposure. A total of 60 animals will be utilized for these series of experiments (Animals in the protection arm equals 24 and the rescue arm equals 36).  Duties:  The contractor shall perform a full range of research procedures, within the scope of his/her training and experience, on site using SUNY furnished facilities, supplies and equipment. Workload occurs as a result of scheduled and unscheduled requirements for research activities.  Primary workload is a result of experiments generated to pursue the specific aims of research protocols funded by the Office of Naval Research and the DoD Spatial Orientation Center (DSOC), Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  Contractor is responsible for a full range of experimental requirements in auditory physiologic research including: animal preparation and care, calibration and quality control of sound equipment and measurements, impulse and kurtotic noise exposures, physiologic assessments, collection and gathering of biological specimens, shipping of biological material, planning and execution of research within the personnel and equipment capabilities of the SUNY facility, and the quality and timeliness of experimental records and reports required to document procedures performed and services provided. Contractor shall closely supervise the conduct of the study including all physiological measures, tissue collections and staining for accuracy and completeness, and shall monitor supply and materials levels and work with appropriate personnel to reorder supplies, animals, and materials as needed to support ongoing and planned research.  Details of work: Contractor will expose chinchillas to impulse and kurtotic noise. Impulse noise consists of 100 shots at 150 dB peak SPL in intervals of 1 impulse/sec. Kurtotic noise consists of continuous octave band noise centered at 4 kHz; 84-86 dB SPL and 113 dB peak SPL applied 1/sec impulse noise 3h duration. In the first set of protection experiments groups of animals will be designated as Control and ALCAR groups.  The ALCAR group will receive IP injections twice daily of ALCAR (100mg/kg) 48 hrs and one-hour before and one hour following noise exposure, then BID the following two days after exposure to noise to investigate protective effects. The Control group will be given saline injections at the same volume on the same schedule as the ALCAR group. The second set of rescue experiments groups of six animals each (Control; ALCAR; NAC), will receive an equivalent total dose of the AOs in the same concentrations as in first set of experiments but the treatments will be administered only after exposure to investigate rescue effects. All injections will be given by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (ALCAR at 100mg/kg and NAC at 325 mg/kg. Again the control animals will be noise-exposed but received the volume saline injections on the same schedule as the AOs.  Contractor is responsible for performing hearing assessments measured at 1, 2, 4, 6 1n3 8 kHz using auditory brainstem response (ABR) via subcutaneous needle electrodes placed in the skin of the head and proximal to the ear on all animals.  In the protective group, the ABRs will be obtained prior to injections of AOs or saline, after injection of AOs or saline but before noise exposure, one hour after noise exposure, and 11 and 21 days post-noise.  ABRs will be obtained in the rescue group before noise exposure, one hour after noise exposure, and on day 11 and day 21 post-noise exposure.  Contractor will, immediately upon completion of the final threshold measurements, euthanized the animal and then the cochleae will be harvested. Cochleae will be perfused with warmed (37o C) succinic dehydrogenase solution containing 1% nitrotetrazolium chloride blue, 0.2M sodium succinate and 0.2M PBS and then incubated at 37o C for one hour. After incubation the cochleae will be perfused with PBS and then 4% paraformaldehyde solution buffered with 0.1 Molar phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After suitable fixation time, the specimens will then be perfused and rinsed with 0.1M PBS and then stored and shipped in this solution at 4o C to NMCSD for hair cell counts.  
Contractor will closely provide oversight and guidance for all procedures and data analysis of all experiments at the State University New York, Hearing Research Laboratory, Buffalo, NY.  Contractor will also work closely with COL. Richard Kopke, MC, USA, NMCSD Program Manager who has scientific and technical responsibility for this research project, to coordinate investigational efforts, trouble shoot problems that develop and to collate data from the different work sites.

I. INTRODUCTION.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) is soliciting proposals for Research and Development (R&D) concepts in Sensor, Communication, Information, and Integration Technologies.  Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  NAVAIR is working with sponsor agencies to advance the science and technology of Sensor, Communication, Information, and Integration Technologies.   Future weapon systems will increasingly rely on sophisticated sensors and capabilities from a myriad of platforms.  Developmental and operational Mountaintop Test Bed (MTB) activities focused on integrating various architectures  Operational, Technical and Systems  aimed at leveraging the most recent technological advances in both sensors and embedded and/or information based weapons systems.  The overall program objectives are: (A) to explore and develop concepts and capability for next generation advanced surveillance radar and electronics testbed on Makaha Ridge, Kauai  Advanced Integrated Radar, Electronics, and Photonics (AIREP); (B) to explore advanced mobile command and control capability utilizing airborne communications relay  Mobile Modular Command Center (M2C2); (C) certify the sustainability and safety of candidate systems, and (D) promote those systems through the procurement process.  The end goal is to transition needed products to the acquisition community.  Based on programmatic, technical risks, funding and schedule constraints, the appropriate acquisition strategy must be taken into consideration.  Such acquisition strategies to take into consideration include grand design, P3I or evolutionary.  Due to the rising emphasis towards software developmental costs, the appropriate software development models must be taken into consideration.  Such software development models to take into consideration include waterfall, incremental or spiral.  Additionally, hardware size, weight, and technology upgrade costs of the candidate systems are of particular concern.  Historically, the preponderance of awards have been in the area of one-to-ten million dollars; however, this does not preclude awards of a lower or higher dollar value.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI 3035 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-12.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative of Toronto, Canada for rare HIV patient samples. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.2 % of the general HIV patient population and the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative has a large cohort of these.  Currently, our research is wholly dependent on the use of these specimens as part of Project No. Z01 AI 000851-04, The Role of Viral Reservoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease.   Many of our experiments require repeated collation of cells from these patients as part of longitudinal analyses.  In addition, given that we cannot obtain the numbers of cells that are necessary to complete our analysis by one visit, it is critical to receive the samples continuously from these patients in order to successfully execute our project.  Sample preparation will include leukopheresis, lymphocyte isolation, in vitro testing and cryopreservation.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Bethesda, MD.  This is a fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are ?Destination.?  The anticipated period of performance will be 04/07/03 ? 9/30/03.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ?

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source firm fixed price contract with H. Koch and Sons Company, Anaheim, CA for a modification to the MA-16 inertia reel in order to provide a webbing retraction and automatic locking device for use with existing H-60 Aircraft Crewmember Safety Belts.  The MA-16 Inertia Reel is qualified to the latest revision of Military Specification MIL-R-8236F, Reel, Shoulder Harness, Inertia Lock.   The modification will provide increased webbing payout for aircrew cabin mobility, and alter automatic locking thresholds as appropriate for mobile aircrew.  The retractor will incorporate a mechanical interface bolt for single point attachment to the cabin ceiling, permitting self-alignment of the retractor with mobile aircrew.  It will also incorporate an end fitting on the webbing compatible with the current Crewmember's Safety Belt.  Approximately 50 units are required for first article testing 60 days after contract award, and approximately 500 units are required for production deliveries beginning 240 days after contract award and lasting approximately 5 months.  Associated engineering, logistic support, and technical data are also required.  The Air Force placed H. Koch and Sons on the Qualified Products Lists in September 1996 for the MA-16 Inertia Reel.  H. Koch and Sons Company is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the MA-16 inertia reel and the only known source with the technical expertise and data to meet this need.  This synopsis is published for information purposes only.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT: COMBAT ZONES THAT SEE (CTS): The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) intends to publish a Broad Agency Announcement on or before 25 March 2003 on the Combat zones That See (CTS) Program.  A Briefing to Industry (BTI) is scheduled for 27 March 2003 to be held in Arlington, VA.  For further information on location and pre-registration, reference URL: http://www.schafercorp-ballston.com/bti2003.  Pre-registration for the CTS BTI is mandatory.  Persons not pre-registered will be turned away at meeting check-in and will not be allowed to register at the meeting.  Pre-registered persons will be required to show government-issued identification (i.e., driver?s license, etc.) at meeting check-in.  Interested organizations should register by 20 March 2003 via WWW at http://www.schafercorp-ballston.com/bti2003.  The purpose of the CTS Briefing to Industry (BTI) is to provide and clarify the general vision for the project, the project structure and schedule, technology components, and contracting mechanisms.  All briefing materials as well as a BTI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file will be posted on a publicly accessed area within 5 days of the meeting.  There will be no handouts provided at the CTS BTI.  The Combat zones That See (CTS) Program explores concepts, develops algorithms, and delivers systems for utilizing large numbers (1000s) of cameras to provide the close-in sensing demanded for military operations in urban terrain.  Automatic video understanding will reduce the manpower needed to view and manage this impossibly large collection of data and reduce the bandwidth required to exfiltrate the data to manageable levels.  The ability to track vehicles across extended distances is the key to providing actionable intelligence for military operations in urban terrain.  Combat zones That See will advance the state-of-the-art for multiple-camera video tracking, to the point where expected track lengths reach city-sized distances.    Trajectories and appearance information resulting from these tracks are the key elements to performing higher-level inference and motion pattern analysis on video-derived information.  Combat zones That See will assemble the video understanding, motion pattern analysis, and sensing strategies into coherent systems suited to Urban Combat and Force Protection.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate with FUNDACRID on a sole source basis to improve access to health and disaster information in Latin America.  Currently NLM has a contract with FUNDACRID (Contract No. N01-LM-0-3510) for similar activities in three Central American countries, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador.  The success of this project has prompted interest in creating local disaster information centers in other countries in the region, including Guatemala and Panama.  NLM has determined that the most appropriate mechanisms to assist in this effort are the development of a Disaster Information Center Toolkit , the evaluation of the existing centers, continued promotional materials and activities for the centers, and the creation of a mirror web site for the main Disaster Information Center at one of the existing local centers. NLM has determined that FUNDACRID, as the administrative arm for the Regional Disaster Information Center (CRID) for Latin America and the Caribbean, is uniquely qualified to conduct this project.  CRID, which is based in Costa Rica, has the unique experience of collecting, indexing, and disseminating health and disaster information to many Latin American countries.  Its organization was based on the structure and experiences of the Disaster Documentation Center, initiated by Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in 1990. FUNDACRID's mission is to develop a disaster preparedness and prevention culture in the region.  FUNDACRID is the premiere source of health and disaster-related information produced by and for Latin America and the Caribbean.  Taking advantage of, and strengthening the existing FUNDACRID infrastructure and experience to support the development of a Disaster Information Center Toolkit, promote and evaluate existing centers, and provide backup support via a mirror site will avoid duplication of effort, save resources, and indirectly benefit the other countries in the region. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a Request for Proposals available.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  See Numbered Note 22.

Roman, Contracting Officer.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION of PROJECT and TWO-PHASE PROCUREMENT PROCESS.  
THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The procurement is for the award of a Design-Build contract. The Two-Phase, Design-Build selection procedures (FAR 36.3) will be utilized for this procurement. The project consists of the design and construction of a Northwest Parking Garage (NWPG) with 936 car spaces, six-level pre-cast pre-stressed concrete structure sitting over a cast in place partial underground utility vault heavily reinforced for blast mitigation (force protection), elevator and stair towers, and necessary mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. Site improvements include paved drives, walks, landscape areas, and utility relocation. The work includes all incidental related work to provide a complete and useable facility. The estimated cost for design and construction of the project is greater than $10,000,000 (FAR 36.204). 
Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, and is the BEST VALUE, to the Government, price and technical factors considered. 

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to no more than three (3) offerors based on Phase I RFP evaluation factors that include: FACTOR A - PAST PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANT PROJECT EXPERIENCE (FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION); FACTOR B - TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR KEY PERSONNEL (FOR DESIGN TEAM AND CONSTRUCTION TEAM QUALIFICATIONS); FACTOR C - PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH,  CONSTRUCTION QUALITY CONTROL, SAFETY AND EXPERIENCE MODIFIER RATE. FACTOR D - OTHER SOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS. A maximum of three (3) firms will be selected to submit Technical and Price Proposals for Phase II and an amendment will be issued to ONLY those firms determined in Phase I to be the most highly qualified. 

Phase II is to determine the "Best Value" to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated on the following technical and cost/price factors:  FACTOR A - PAST PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANT PROJECT EXPERIENCE (same as Phase I); FACTOR B - TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR KEY PERSONNEL (same as Phase I); FACTOR C - DESIGN APPROACH, CRITIQUE AND ANALYSIS; FACTOR D - CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN AND SCHEDULE; FACTOR E - SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING EFFORT. The price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness.
The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. OFFEROR ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT THOSE FIRMS TO PROCEED TO PHASE II AND/OR SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, offers should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Offerors should not presume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. Results of proposals will not be available until after award.  

Proposed Phase I and Phase II Solicitation Dates: The Government intends to issue the Phase I RFP electronically by posting it on the NIH website: http://ccb.od.nih.gov on or about 20 MAR 2003.  Phase I Proposals will be due thirty (30) days from the date of issue of the Phase I RFP. Offerors must register themselves on the NIH website indicated above. 
The Phase II RFP, including the plans and specs, will be posted at a later date on the NIH website for viewing and downloading, although the download time may be excessive.  Offeror's are also advised that using a telephone modem will result in abnormally long down load time resulting in disconnection.  Copies of a compact disk (CD ROM) of the Phase II plans and specs may be issued to the firms. The official plan holders list will be maintained on the website.


SOLICITATION REGISTRATION:

Registration for this solicitation is optional. If you register for this solicitation, you will receive a courtesy email notifying you of all amendments for this solicitation posted to this website.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement - Modular furniture reconfiguration services Solicitation No. 52PAPT301005.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia, has a requirement for Commercial Item inventory, planning, and reconfiguration services for all existing systems workstations and modular furniture at the USPTO. The primary purpose of the inventory is to create an accurate survey of the systems furniture components and to plan the reconfiguration of the systems furniture on a phased moving schedule, to fit in standard size offices.  The secondary purpose is to identify existing modular furniture at the USPTO, which is too large for future offices, or has wall-mounted items.  Planning services will include a determination of what new systems product (per manufacturer, product line, and finish) will be required to reconfigure layouts within closed offices.  The planning portion for modular furniture requires analysis of existing furniture conditions and determination as to physical moves and re-reinstallation at a new facility. The reconfiguration services include disassembling the systems furniture, physical relocation to a new site, and reconfiguring it per the approved layouts. Warehousing space for the receipt and dispersal of systems furniture parts and pieces are also requested for the reconfiguration. The period of performance is anticipated from March 2003 through May 2005.  This acquisition is a 100% total small business set-aside. A copy of the Solicitation 52PAPT301005 will be available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm on February 12, 2003.  Proposals are due back for review on March 7, 2003. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 484210 and 811420. The point of contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Frank L. Rumph, Contracting Officer at 703.306.4505.

<DESC>The BEP will conduct two site visits in order to allow prospective offerors to view the equipment and site conditions.  The site visits have been scheduled at the following times and place:  Date: September 30, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.; Date: October 1, 2002, Time:  8:30 a.m.;  Location:  Bureau of Engraving & Printing, 13th Street (between C and D Streets), SW, Washington, DC  20228-0001.  Due to the closure of the BEP?s 14th Street entrance all conference participants must access the BEP at the 13th & C Street entrance.  Interested parties are required to submit the names of the individuals that plan to attend not later than 24 hours prior to the date and time of the conference.  As the site visit on September 30, 2002 is a Monday, offerors must submit their request no later than Friday, September 27, 2002 by 4:00 p.m.  This time constraint is required due to security reasons.  Submission or substitutions to the names of the individuals attending may not be changed after the 24- hour time limitation.  Offeror?s are limited to a maximum of two (2) representatives from each firm due to  limited space availability for each site visit.  Due to limited time and security constraints an offeror may attend only one site visit.  These limitations are to ensure that all prospective offerors that request a site visit will be given an opportunity to attend.  The Government will try to accommodate the offeror?s request for one of the specified site visit dates, if possible.  Interested parties are to submit their company?s name, name(s) of individual(s) and their title that are planning to attend, and a point of contact including their phone number.  This information must be submitted in writing to Larry McCain, Contract Specialist at the following email address: larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov/.  The duration of time for the site visit will be determined at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist.  Individuals attending the conference must provide picture identification (e.g., drivers license or passport) and should arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the conference start time to allow for processing through security.  Additional dates for site visits will only be established if both site visit dates are full and the offeror?s request for site visit was submitted 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  Additional site visits will not be scheduled due to an offeror?s inability to attend the scheduled visits or due to an offeror?s failure to submit their request to attend a site visit 24-hours prior to the first scheduled site visit.  This site visit is optional.  In no event shall failure to visit the delivery site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Manufacture of HH-65 Blade Storage Cans
<SOLNBR>DTCG38-03-Q-200003
<RESPDATE>040403
<CONTACT>Cynthia Soules, HH65 Purchasing Agent, Phone 252-335-6641, Fax 252-334-5240, Email CSoules@arsc.uscg.mil
<DESC>The above-cited solicitation is hereby amended to revise the Governments requirement and to extend the closing date.  This requirement is for the manufacture of HH-65 helicopter main rotor blade storage cans in accordance with the specifications stated herein.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has the requirement to obtain 150 each new shipping/storage containers for main rotor blades (P/Ns 366A11-0010-05, 366A11-0010-03, 366A11-010-02, and 366A11-0010-06) used on the HH-65 Dolphin helicopters.  The USCG plans to replace the existing shipping containers in order to improve reliability, maintainability, and protection for the main rotor blades.  Blade containers may be stored outside and are therefore exposed to a variety of environmental conditions.  The USCG will provide access to a main rotor blade for the sole purpose of taking measurements and photographs as needed for container design. The location will be at the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC or another USCG Air Station.  Access requests shall be coordinated through Mr. Tom Schweers, (252) 335-6612.  Materials used in the container fabrication shall be certified and suitable to meet all requirements of this specification. Standard commercial parts shall be used to the maximum extent possible, consistent with reliability, maintainability, and performance.  Commercial utility parts such as screws, bolts, nuts, with suitable properties, may be used. The containers shall be designed to be repairable and of the minimum practical weight consistent with the requirements of this specification. The containers shall be designed to prevent salt air, water, and dirt intrusion. The packing material shall be molded to fit the contour and outline of the blade. Note: Non-water-absorbing foam is required.  Containers shall have hand-operated, self-contained latches.  These latches shall include over center, cam action, and/or spring-loaded configurations that are convenient to use and provide consistent clamping force.  Physical protection by recessing or shielding is required to prevent damage during normal handling.  All sealing surfaces shall be such to ensure sealing consistent with the requirements of this specification. The main closure flange between the cover and the base shall be configured such that rainwater will not enter the container.  The cover section shall be of a lightweight shell of sufficient rigidity to support one loaded shipping container stacked on top when assembled with the base section and shall contain lifting handles for handling when detached from the base. No obstructions shall exist to interfere with forklift tine insertion when containers are stacked.  Provisions for cover lifting shall be provided. Manual lifting provisions shall be provided when personnel can safely remove or install the cover or section. The cover or section shall be capable of being lifted without injury to personnel and damage to the main rotor blade.  Each container shall be provided with alignment provisions on top and bottom in order to allow rapid and orderly stacking operations for containers of the same part number. These provisions shall provide lateral restraint and shall not interfere with forklift access. The container shall be capable of supporting the superimposed weight of one like container including the contents. The container shall be constructed to permit lifting by forklift truck and pallet jack from the longest side without employing additional blocking and without permanent deformation of the container. The container shell material shall be adequately protected or reinforced so that forklift handling will not result in damage that would prevent the container from performing its intended functions.  The following service facilities shall be incorporated in one end of the container. All facilities shall be recessed within the container wall or otherwise protected.

(1) Record receptacle. A cylindrical receptacle shall be provided of such size as to permit easy insertion and removal of the necessary records. The attitude of the installed receptacle shall be such that water will not collect in it when the record receptacle cover is removed. There shall be no access from the record receptacle into the interior compartment of the container. The receptacle shall be closed from the outside with a watertight cover.  (2) Receptacle covers. All record cover(s) shall be permanently attached to the container by means that will not interfere with the accessibility to the material in the receptacle. The cover shall be capable of being removed and installed by hand or common hand tools. Each container shall be identified with a data plate containing the following information in four-inch letters: Part number of the container; Manufacturers cage code; and the description HH-65 MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  During normal shipping, handling and storage, containers and blades shall be able to withstand shock and vibration and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions.  The container and all accessories shall sustain no damage that would affect the ability of the container or impair its performance.  The main rotor blades shall sustain no damage.  A relief valve, humidity indicator, view ports, drain plug and desiccant basket are not required. Throughout the life of this contract, the contractor shall maintain a quality system in compliance with ISO 9001, ANSI/ASQ Q9001 or a quality system that is subject to the Contracting Officers approval. The contractor shall provide a technical data package to include drawings, specifications, and part numbers used in the container construction.  The contractor shall provide a repair manual and replacement part listing for each container furnished under this contract.  Line Item (1), Technical Data Package for HH-65 main rotor blade shipping/storage containers, quantity 1 each (not separately priced) with delivery no later than thirty (30) calendar days after date of award; Line Item (2), Main Rotor Blade Shipping/Storage Containers, quantity 150 each, delivery of 1 each first article no later than 60 calendar days after contract award and delivery of 149 each production quantity desired no later than 6 months and required no later than 12 months following approval of first article; Line Item (3) Repair Manual and Replacement Part Listing (150 each) to be provided with each container (not separately priced); and Optional Line Item (4), First Article Testing (1 each) no later than thirty (30) calendar days after notification by the USCG.  NOTE:  In the event the USCG requires first article testing, line item (4) may be unilaterally exercised by the Government.  In this event, the contractor shall obtain the testing at a Government-approved testing facility.  Such testing will include, but may not be limited to, flat drop, end impact and vibration testing.  The USCG reserves the right to witness the first article testing in these instances. If first article does not pass the testing, the contractor has thirty (30) calendar days to correct the deficiencies and satisfactorily complete the test.  If a second test is needed, it will be done at the contractors expense.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement initially posted 19 Nov 02 under the auspices of market research is hereby modified to formally advertise Solicitation No. MDA412-03-R-0002 scheduled for electronic release on this website on or about 28 Feb 03.  The solicitation will seek offers under commercially negotiated best value source selection procedures in response to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Europe (DoDDS-E) Heidelberg School Maintenance Program 2003 contract initiative for the acquisition of comprehensive maintenance and custodial support services for over 100 facilities and accompanying grounds strategically located throughout the Heidelberg, Bavaria, Kaiserslautern, Mediterranean, and Isles districts.  Contract type will be a task order driven Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity arrangement manifesting a cost profile ranging from $280,000,000 to $340,000,000 with a guaranteed minimum amount to be disclosed at time of solicitation issuance.  Contract award is tentatively scheduled for 01 Jul 03 subsequently encompassing a base year, 4 one-year option periods, 1 three-year award term period, and a final two-year award term period aggregating to a maximum contract performance period of 10 years.  Immediately available for phase-in will be up to 26 facilities operated under jurisdictional authority of the Heidelberg district.  Remaining districts will be activated for phase-in on an optional basis at government discretion pending examination of award results and time frames necessary for appropriate transition from other contractual obligations.  It should be noted it is the government's express intent to award a single contract integrating both maintenance and custodial support services with proviso a multiple award scenario may be considered.  In the event multiple awards do materialize, the government will not award a contract at any level lower than an entire district.  Major evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be past performance weighted at 35%, management at 35%, and technical at 30%, the combination of all non-cost related factors being slightly more important than price.  This contract initiative represents a true performance-based services approach whereby in response to a solicitation generated statement of objectives tasks will be performed in accordance with a contractor-authored statement of work, other applicable contract terms and conditions, and performance metrics firmly established by industry standards.  At time of initial screening of proposals the government reserves the right to limit competition to the most highly competitive offerors from which award will ultimately be achieved via the conduct of oral presentations.  Concurrently, this will not preclude the contracting officer from awarding on initial offers without the conduct of discussions if doing so is deemed to be in the best interest of the government.  Level of competition for this procurement is unrestricted.  Once the solicitation is made available for download it will be the responsibility of competing offerors to monitor the website for release of applicable amendments or other related information.  All interested sources possessing the necessary resources and proven capability to perform a requirement of this magnitude are encouraged to submit an offer that will be considered.  FedBizOpps registrants interested in this acquisition are requested to email the below point of contact to ensure compilation of a complete and accurate competitor database.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to questions, which have been posed by potential offerors.  Question 1 What is the height of the armature centerline of the UD T 5000 Shaker in the horizontal orientation that the slip plate will interface with? 
Answer to Question 1 The height of the center line for the UD T5000 shaker is 34.5 inches from the base. However, there is a steel plate existing on our seismic mass that the slip plate will sit on. The height of this plate is approximately 13.25 inches from floor. Therefore the slip table will have to be raised approximately 21.25 inches (minus the height of your system). The quote should account for minor changes in center line for the possibility of a different shaker system being purchased.  Question 2  What is the interface bolt pattern of the existing steel plate on NRL's seismic mass?  Answer to Question 2  The steel plate to interface with has no specified bolt pattern. It has a substantial amount of space for securing options.(i.e. on top, or on the side) Question 3  What is the insert size and the thread of the T5000 Shaker that will be ordered?  Answer to Question 3   This is still being thought of. We are considering 1/2-20 hex head, and 3/4-10 hex head. You should allow for either option.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer the remaining outstanding questions that the government has received regarding this requirement.  The government is not anticipating any further amendments.  Question 1: Percentages are applied to technical response areas, but it is unclear how price will factor in the award.  How will price be evaluated? Answer 1: Price is important, however, the technical proposal will be considered more importantly than price.  Question 2: Further, it is requested that a firm fixed proposal be offered, but government estimated by labor categories are supplied.  How should pricing be supplied( i.e. labor rates or aggregate totals by task)?  Answer 2: Supply pricing by aggregate total by task. Question 3: If labor rates, will the award be fixed rate or fixed total based on Government estimates for hours?  Answer 3: N/A.  Question 4:  Are there provisions for additional funding should the government labor estimated prove to be too optimistic?  Answer 4: Yes, there is a provision for additional funding, however, no guarantee we'll add funding, however.  Question 5: The Government has allocated 10 desks to this effort, but the anticipated labor hours equate to five (5) full time professionals.  It is envisioned that staff that is not fully dedicated to this effort, but specializes in support of one or more deliverables will use some of these hours?  
Answer 5: The allocation of 10 desks to this effort is incorrect.  No additional personnel are anticipated above five.  Question 6: What is the Government's vision or experience with regard to the number of dedicated staff that are needed to work full time on this project?  Answer 6: See answer for Question No. 5 above.
Question 7: Project Scheduling and Control Progress and Status Reporting deliverables use contractor formal. What scheduling and control tool(s) are currently in use?  Will the contractor have access to these tools or should licensing be budgeted to install contractor-furnished tools on the GFE PCs that will be supplied?
Answer 7:  The Government currently uses  Microsoft products to include AMSRealtime and Project.   The contractor will have access to all tools currently in use.  While the Government is not entrenched with these products, we are most familiar with them.   Should better tools be available, the Government would consider transition if not at task award, but during the period of performance.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DON) in general, and the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) in particular, are entering a period of radical change on several levels. NAVSUP is engaged in changing the way we perform our business practices, the tools we use to execute our functions, the way in which we have traditionally aligned our business units, the organizational relationships and reporting chain, and the restructuring of staff through contract agreements and Navy Transformation. Each of these changes is significant and we appreciate the impact that any one of these changes has on our staff from an emotional, physical, and mental perspective. What we dont have an appreciation for is how to cope with the scope and scale of these changes as they all converge on the organization simultaneously. NAVSUP is interested in learning what industry experts in the area of Organizational Ch ange Management would propose to help us successfully manage our environment of change. Therefore, we our seeking Industrys advice and counsel on how to proceed from here.

<DESC>&#65279;The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Executive
Institute (FEI) in Charlottesville, Virginia intends to issue a
sole source contract to the Aspen Institute for a series of
Values and Leadership Seminars.  These programs will draw upon
classical and contemporary readings and be offered as small-group
Socratic seminars.  The seminars will be conducted as round-table
discussion among participating executives.  The Values and
Democratic Leadership seminar will provide executives with a
broad understanding of the core values that have shaped American
democracy (e.g. freedom, equality, community).  The readings must
draw from mostly classical sources as these have guided western
political thinking.  The Leading Change in Government seminar
will engage executives in discussions of how to lead change in a
manner consistent with democratic values in our increasingly
diverse and divergent times.  The Justice, Society & Government
seminar will engage executives in examining what constitutes a
just society and what justice means in the U.S. society. The
Global Leadership seminar will focus executives on looking at
how the U.S. can best exercise values-based leadership in a
global context.  Readings on change, government, and leadership
will help executives consider how to both preserve democratic
values yet change their government institutions to meet Americas
needs.  FEI will offer one such seminar in each of ten four-week
programs per fiscal year and 5-7 such seminars per fiscal year
through the Center for Executive Leadership.

No other providers have been identified that meet the standards
as developed by FEI.  Companies that can met the above described
requirements should submit complete technical information and
representative pricing that demonstrates their ability and
describes their course offerings.  No solicitation will be issued
as a result of this notice.  This notice is for the purpose of
determining if sources other than Aspen Institute can meet our
requirements.  The government will not pay for the information
provided.  A determination by the Government not to open this
requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is
solely within the discretion of OPM.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS) Radar Systems Program Manager is seeking information on the ability to develop and produce a high mobility, high performance, affordable Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) used to support the USMC direct and indirect Target Acquisition and Friendly adjust fire missions on current and future Mortar, Artillery, Rocket, and Missile systems. The radar should be able to detect, track, targets in all terrain, weather, and electronic attack environments. The radar should have a very low false track rate and sufficient clutter cancellation/sub-clutter visibility to maintain full sensitivity.  Track quality shall be sufficient to support counter fire missions of M198, LW 155, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS) and future counter fire engagements. The system shall interface to current (AFATDS) and future Command and Control systems via wireless digital communications. A single vehicle is objective, however, any combination of vehicles (motorized or trailered) will be considered provided such combinations are transportable within a C-130 aircraft (size/weight/cube) in a road transport configuration and can be externally slung under a V-22 (no more than a total of two aircraft required to facilitate transport). While a prime mover organic to the Marine Corps (HMMV) is objective, alternative modes will be considered if submitted. The radar shall require less than 8 minutes for 4 men to set-up (goal) or 10 minutes with 4 men (threshold). The equipment enclosures shall protect equipment from damage by dust, wind, salt spray, rain, and ice. Contractors are invited to read the draft Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) ORD at Anteon Corporation (Suite 101, 1229 Garrisonville Rd, Stafford, Virginia 22556) by coordinating a visit request in advance with Ms. Lisa Herbst (540) 658-1335. Interested contractors should identify their concept for a Radar platform of similar footprint to the AN/TPQ-46A  but with greater range and capabilities. Contractor submittals should include a proposed Plan of Action and Milestones for delivering the first three systems by FY09 (to include the appropriate government operational l testing period).

DESC:  Request for Information/Market Research-The Secret Service seeks information on commercial off the shelf software products that can provide automation of existing personnel scheduling methods.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  IN ANTICIPATION OF A LARGE RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO RETURN INDIVIDUAL PHONE CALLS.  INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW ITS INSTRUCTIONS AS FURTHER INFORMATION WILL NOT BE PROVIDED AT THIS TIME.  IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ONLY A PARTIAL NOTICE OF THIS REQUIREMENT THROUGH A VENDOR SERVICE, YOU MUST OBTAIN THE FULL, UNEDITED NOTICE FROM EITHER THE COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY OR THE ELECTRONIC POSTING SYSTEM.

Overview:  The United States Secret Service is seeking sources capable of providing a commercial, off-the-shelf software product which can be used for law enforcement personnel scheduling.  This system must be a scalable, multi-user system accessible via LAN/Intranet.  An intranet/thin-client is preferred.  It should be capable of using Oracle as the RDBMS.  It should be Java based and web-server independent, capable of running on multiple platforms.  Interested parties should include rough-order-of-magnitude pricing for software, customization of applications, on-site installation and annual out-year maintenance costs for software and personnel support.  Specific requirements sought include:

1.	Provide an API to integrate with an existing security interface that utilizes single sign on, PKI/Smart Card technology.

2.	Allow officers to view schedules, respond to requests for assignments and submit leave, overtime, and alternative shift requests via a web portal accessible via the Intranet.

3.	Allow scheduling officers to produce daily schedules for multiple shifts and for multiple locations.

4.	Sources shall have demonstrable, direct and recent experience in implementation and deployment of law enforcement scheduling software.

5.	The software must support a 24-hour, 7 day per week, 365 day per year work environment.

6.	At the time of the offering, the software must demonstrate the ability to produce a work schedule for a minimum of 100 people, resulting in a master schedule for a period of not less than one week.

7.	The software must have current ability to produce reports concerning personnel, time and attendance, assignments, staffing and work schedules.  The software must be capable of retaining prior work schedules, and have this information available for utilization in preparing future schedules.  Software capable of monitoring workload trends and recommending a draft schedule encompassing such trends would be highly desirable. 

8.	The software must have the current ability to be used and viewed simultaneously at different physical locations.  The software must be capable, through user defined access privileges, to limit access to information on an "as required basis" as well as a schedule being "locked" upon approval and "unlocked" for updates.  

9.	The software must have demonstrated ability to automatically produce work schedules based on pre-set business rules and operator criteria.  The software will encompass expert-knowledge descriptions of personnel skill levels, abilities, and availability which is capable of being understood and utilized by the software program in constructing shifts of the required personnel number and length of shift cycles.  Notification to the operator when and if a rule/requirement is not followed, through an on-line informational message, is considered highly desirable.  

10.	The software must be capable, in a "user-friendly" manner (i.e., by a non-IT, end user computer operator), of allowing for the defining, modifying, and removing of the underlying business-rules and operator criteria, as well as any expert-knowledge assumptions such as personnel availability, skill levels, etc., used to generate schedules.  The software must be capable of regenerating new schedules when such rules, criteria, or assumptions are changed.  Notification to the operator when changes to current and/or future work schedules have been effected by these changes, through an on-line informational message, is considered highly desirable.  

11.	Any feature of the existing system, which demonstrates the ability to utilize an expert-knowledge database resulting in software-generated recommendations, should be highlighted in your response, even if not specifically listed herein.

12.	Sources meeting the above requirements shall submit a written statement of capabilities (SOC) not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, detailing their experience and capabilities in the area above.  Interested parties should submit a written extract of the operation of their existing commercial-off-the-shelf software products, which could potentially be adapted for the above use.  It will benefit interested parties to provide as much detail as possible about the useful features of their systems, as described by this announcement, so that these features can be evaluated for inclusion in a potential upcoming request for proposals.
 

Any demonstration CDs or discs submitted must be capable of being run on a PC with Windows 2000 or XP, and include operator instructions on how to load and view the program.  Print capabilities, to include pull down menus and written descriptions, are desirable.  

If time permits, and depending on the volume of responses, individual vendors MAY be contacted for a product demo prior to release of a solicitation.  The Secret Service will not pay for any costs associated with the demonstration of any software products or any written response to this notice under this request for information announcement.  Responses should be mailed to the following address: United States Secret Service, Procurement Division, 950 H Street, NW, Suite 6700, Washington, DC 20373, Attn: K. Wilson no later than Friday, March 21, 2003..

The following provides a list of some of the tasks required under this ICS contract: (1) Supply Support: The Contractor shall establish and maintain a supply and transportation priority system providing DPGDS parts and establish a worldwide distribution system.   The Contractor shall also ensure that best commercial practice marking/labeling and Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHS&T) requirements are met. The Contractor shall ship all parts by priority transportation to the requester?s point of origin within 3 business days of its receipt of the request from the Program Office for priority orders and within 7 calendar days of the request for routine orders. When commercial transportation is used, the Contractor is responsible for delays, lost or damaged materials and shall remain obligated to meet the performance requirements of this contract. If Government transportation is directed, the Contractor will ensure that all documentation, marking, labeling, preparation, and packaging are in accordance with appropriate Government regulations and provide pick-up and delivery of all assets as directed by the Government Contracting Office, to/from Air Force Traffic Management Office. (2) Technical Services: The Contractor shall provide technical services to include maintaining and dispatching anywhere in the world, a Field Service Support Team with expertise in medium voltage power generation and distribution systems, and specifically the Deployable Power Generation and Distribution System (DPGDS) equipment, to perform repairs, solve complex maintenance problems that are beyond the Government's capability, and provide On-The-Job-Training (OJT) as required. This support may be required in hazardous duty or differential pay zones, as identified by the State Department. The Contractor will ensure that their designated technical service representatives remain current in standard worldwide immunizations and maintain a passport. The Contractor personnel assigned to provide technical support shall obtain a passport through contractor resources and must comply with the security requirements listed in Industrial Security Manual, DOD and Air Force Series Regulations, and the contract DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification.

Technical Services will be charged to the Government on Time and Materials CLINs using agreed to rates. (3) ICS and Warranty Management: The Government?s DPGDS Performance Specification will be used by the Contractor to validate parts substitution/interchangeability to ensure they meet the required form, fit, and function (or other essential characteristics) of the original part. Whenever any DPGDS part is changed, substituted and/or modified, the Contractor will update all existing DPGDS documentation and provide the Government all source data and change pages required to update existing Commercial Technical Manuals (CTMs), or provide new DPGDS CTMs, if required. This data will be provided to the Government within 30 calendar days of any change being implemented.

<SUBJECT>S -- Utility Infrastructure Services  Request for Information/Sources Sought.
<DESC>Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is seeking sources that are capable and interested in participating in privatization of on-base utility distribution infrastructure at its various bases in the continental United States.  The purpose of this announcement is two fold:  1) to ascertain if there is a viable interest from industry in participating; and 2) to ascertain if any of the privatization solicitations can be set aside for a) small business, b) 8a small business or c) HUBZone small business.  Decisions will be made by AFSPC on a base-by-base and utility-by-utility basis.  If viable interest is not shown for a particular utility distribution system at a particular base, a solicitation for that utility for a individual base will not be issued.  North American Industrial Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221320 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply.  Corresponding small business size standards are 4 million megawatts, 500 employees, $6M in sales, and $6M in sales, respectively.  Parties interested in acquiring utility systems and providing utility distribution services at Air Force Space Command installations listed below should provide a separate statement of interest for each location and each utility identifying the installation name(s) and specific system(s) for which there is interest and for which industry provides separate responses to the questions identified below.  Firms that are either small business or 8a or HUBZone small business need to identify that fact and indicate in which of the three listed small business categories they qualify. The sites and utilities involved are:  (1) Buckley AFB CO with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (2) Cape Cod MA with electricity and water; (3) F.E. Warren AFB WY with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (4) Malmstrom AFB MT with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (5) Schriever AFB CO with natural gas and water (the electricity has been exempted and the wastewater has previously been studied and exempted; (6) Cheyenne Mountain CO with water and wastewater; (7) Peterson AFB CO with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (8) Los Angeles AFS CA with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (9) Vandenberg AFB CA with electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater; (10) Cape Canaveral AFS FL with electricity, water, and wastewater; (11) Patrick AFB FL with electricity  (however, privatization of electricity distribution for Cape Canaveral and Patrick are currently pending under separate agreement; and (12) Clear AFS AK with electricity, water, and wastewater.  If an offeror is interested in multiple systems, separate responses should be provided for each system and for each location of interest.  In addition, interested parties are required to provide information regarding experience and qualifications for operating utility systems for each of the systems of interest.  Contractor selection will NOT be made on the basis of information submitted, rather we will decide if sufficient viable interest exists to warrant issuing RFPs or if any limitation of  participation to small business, 8a or HUBZone small business applies.  Each utility system at each base will be separately solicited, thus firms may pick and choose which utility at individual bases they are interested in.  Please be advised  the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) apply to this procurement and interested parties should reference the draft Request For Proposal (RFP) template at the following website for information regarding terms and conditions.  The draft template RFP can be found at http://www.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CEO/Contracts/UtilPrivatization/UPTemplates.htm.  Specifically, parties are advised the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1, Alt I, found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm will apply when the entity is providing services where the rates are not set by law or regulation for those particular areas of service and acknowledge understanding that acceptance of this clause is required to be considered responsive to any subsequent RFP.  Responses will be used to assist in refining the acquisition strategy and subsequent decisions regarding future issuance of a full and open competitive RFP, a set-aside RFP, a sole source RFP, or, if no viable interest, not issuing an RFP.  If viable responses are not received, the Government has the discretion to determine no market interest exists and no subsequent RFPs be issued (again, on a utility-by-utility, base-by-base basis. Specific responses to the following are needed in order for your firm to be considered viable in providing an offer for services under this program. Provide: (1) Installation and/or Installations of Interest; (2) System of interest: (a) Electric Utility Distribution System; (b) Natural Gas Utility Distribution System; (c) Potable Water Utility Distribution System; (d) Wastewater Utility Distribution System; (3) Your status regarding your authority to support this service: (a) Regulated utility and service is within certificated area of service; (b) Regulated utility providing nonregulated service for this area of service; (d) Regulated utility and service is not within certificated area of service; (e) Non-regulated utility for the service of interest; (4) Classification of your company: (a) Publicly owned utility; (b) Investor owned utility; (c) Cooperative owned utility; (d) Publicly owned and traded company  not a utility; (e) Privately owned company; (f) Limited Liability Corporation; (g) C-Corp; (h) Other, Please Describe; (5) Offeror acknowledges acceptance of application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation terms and conditions included in the RFP template? (6) Acknowledgement that you may be required to comply with the Cost Accounting Standards; (7) If you propose to provide nonregulated service within your proposed service area will your entity accept the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1 Alt 1;  (8) Indicate if your firm or entity is or is not a small business, or 8a or HUBZone small business.  (Not-for-profit entities cannot be a small business.)  - Responses that indicate insufficient capabilities will not be further considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- Auto Stereoscopic Projection Viewer for Glasses Free 3D Visualization
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE AUTO STEREOSCOPIC PROJECTION VIEWER FOR GLASSES FREE 3D VISUALIZATION


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks to license its auto stereoscopic projection viewer technology for 3D visualization applications.

?Virtual reality? stereoscopic displays usually require special eyewear.  LLNL has developed an auto stereoscopic projection viewing device needing no special glasses or eyewear. Virtual reality display techniques developed for glasses free stereoscopic visualization can be connected to remote twin video inputs.  Range information is immediately and intuitively available to the operator creating a ?virtual presence? environment.

The projection viewer was initially designed for viewing of still stereo transparencies. Using digital images and computers allows new options including pan and zoom.   A forty-inch (40?) viewing window provides the operator with an immersive full color glasses free stereoscopic view into real or synthetic 3D worlds.  Live 3D video could as easily be displayed.

Effective stereo viewing is more than a tool for observation of detail.  This 3D viewing technology is suitable for use with computer generated data, recorded images, or for real time control of devices in hazardous, distant, or microscopic environments. Data display benefits from powerful visualization tools. Tactical simulations benefit from sense of presence created, as would electronic gaming.   

Many visualization applications can benefit from stereoscopic imaging. Potential target markets include but not limited to robotics, micromanipulation, hazardous work, medical procedure recording, video conferencing, education, entertainment, product promotions, arcades gaming, and computer workstations. 


Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's auto stereoscopic projection viewer for glasses free 3D visualization should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing the this technology.


Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>A -- Miniature X-Ray Source
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE A MINITURE X-RAY SOURCE

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build a Miniature X-ray Source.

Researchers at LLNL built a working Miniature X-ray Source having a millimeter scale size, which is small enough to fit into a human body (for example into an artery).  The device can produce a broad spectrum of x-ray emissions over a broad range of energies (5-40 keV or higher).  The devices? design features the following achievements:
?	High voltage in extremely small dimensions (1 mm).
?	High vacuum in extremely small volume (cubic mm).
?	Extremely small high voltage connector.

The Miniature X-ray Source has a number of potential medical applications.  These applications include the following:
?	Arterial disease
?	Restenosis
?	Cancer
?	Material analysis

The device consists of a vacuum housing which is highly transparent to x-rays, a high voltage feed-through, a high voltage connection, an anode, and a cathode (hot or cold).  This unit features a rugged design and has practical potential for medical applications.

The design of this device resulted in two U.S. Patents;  6,353,658 and 6,134,300.  In addition, some foreign rights are available.

<SUBJECT>A -- Trace Gas Measurements at Barbados
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce to award a sole source contract to International Science Consultants, 39 Avon Castle Drive, Ringwood, Hants, United Kingdom BH24 2BB, for  a study to measure trace gas concentrations in Barbados.  Background:  The Barbados site is one of four comprising the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) network. This network was established to monitor the long-term trends of several the trace gas species (listed below) that cause stratospheric ozone destruction.  Data from the network are analyzed for long-term trends, changes in sources, and global budgets and published jointly by the GAGE research team.  The species are key compounds in the issues of stratospheric ozone depletion and "greenhouse" climate warming.  Thus, there is a fundamental scientific need to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of these species, and document their long-term increase.  To establish the long-term change with high precision, the measurements must be made with a frequency of at least several observations per day.  NOAA proposes to establish a contract with International Science Consultants (ISC) to continue the Barbados record for a period of one year with options to renew the contract up to four additional years.  There is a critical scientific requirement that the future measurements are directly linked to those of the past and to the other sites of the GAGE network without any breaks in the data. This linkage is important as all of the gases measured are changing in concentration over the space of weeks and their growth rates are also changing.   Without a continuous record that is accurate, the sources and sinks of the gases of interest cannot be defined.  The continuous measurement of ozone deleting gases in the atmosphere is mandated by Congress and must be reported each year for the prior year.   This requirement is completely inflexible and, without this link to the past, the future measurements would have minimal value.  Current Requirement:  The proposed contract is to obtain ambient air concentrations continuously, every 40 minutes, of CFCl3, CF2Cl2, CCl4, CH3CCl3, N20, CH4, CHCl3, and CF2ClCFCl2 taken within 100 meters of the seacoast at East Point (also known as Ragged Point), Barbados.  The measurements should be made for 5 years beginning approximately June 21, 2003.  Measurements shall be made with an accuracy (relative to previous ALE-GAGE measurements) of 0.5% for CH4 and 1% for all other species.  The measurements shall be directly comparable to previous measurements made at the same location since 1978 by the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment and GAGE.  Instruments for making the measurements shall be housed in an air-conditioned shelter.  Results of the measurements shall be provided to NOAA as daily mean concentrations and associated standard deviation of each species within four months of the measurement. To be considered, respondents must submit evidence substantiating that each of the following qualification requirements can be met: (1) Demonstrated experience using gas chromatographs for high-precision atmospheric measurements of the species required.  (2) Demonstrated access to gas calibration standards of all species used for the ALE and GAGE experiments.  (3) Demonstrated ability to install gas chromatographic instruments for unattended operation for high-precision trace gas measurements at a remote location.  (4) Demonstrated capability to install and operate the instruments at Ragged Point, Barbados.  (5) Demonstrated capability to provide continuity with, and direct comparability to, the similar measurements made at the location since 1978.  This is not a formal solicitation.  See notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>70 -- NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO ESTABLISH AN AGENCY STANDARD
<DESC>PURPOSE: The purpose of this notice is to inform the vendor community of the Social Security Administrations (SSA) intention to establish Sun servers and the Solaris operating system as the Agency UNIX standard for the distributed Web systems environment for Websphere applications, Web content serving and Domain Name Systems (DNS) through Fiscal Year 2007.

SCOPE: As required by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, SSA has established infrastructure architecture with the goal of providing a supportable, sustainable environment for life cycle application support. The architecture was defined both to support an effective IT technology environment and to promote cost effective business practices. SSAs approved architecture supports all facets of the IT environment - from mainframe to client/server, from database support to electronic messaging, as well as the numerous other facets. This notice is limited to the Internet/Intranet infrastructure.

BACKGROUND/ISSUES: OMB Circular A-130 requires Agencies to establish policies and procedures for efficient management of information technology and its resources. In addition, the Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001, includes guidance to Agencies on establishing standards to meet Agency needs. Standards help ensure that Agency organizations produce applications and information assets that are consistent and compatible with the Agencys IT infrastructure and in turn help promote more cost-effective business practices. 

The Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO) is responsible for acquiring and maintaining servers to support SSAs Internet/Intranet applications. Initially Sun obviated as the preferred Unix infrastructure due to compatibility issues with alternative platforms for projects such as:

- Retrieval Ware Search Engine;  
- Team Connect software (NDMIS);  
- Livelink (ACT);
- Cold Fusion MX for Websphere; and  
- Gelco Travel Manager.

In 2001, the Office of Systems Electronic Services prepared a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for the Office of Systems Internet/Intranet Environment. In September 2001 SSAs Senior Procurement Executive approved the aforesaid JOFOC with the concurrence of SSAs Competition Advocate. This JOFOC established Sun servers and the Solaris operating system as the UNIX infrastructure platform for the WebSphere Internet/Intranet environment and established a spending cap of $1.1 million for the servers.

Since that time, SSA has rapidly expanded its Internet Customer Services initiatives and continues to roll out additional applications. SSA must be prepared to provide hardware and software components to support each additional application. Without managed capacity increases to support new requirements, SSA must acquire the requisite additional hardware and software for each application planned for migration to production. Each acquisition requires new justification and documentation as prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).

CONCLUSION: 

SSA has a large investment in not only the hardware and software components of the network infrastructure for the web systems environment, but also in the OTSO staff that manages and maintains this infrastructure. OTSO has staff dedicated to configuring, integration testing, monitoring workloads, and maintaining Sun Servers for the distributed WebSphere infrastructure. SSA has also invested a significant amount of money and resources in training this staff. Similarly, the development staff has also invested personnel and training to perfect the use of this platform. This trend is anticipated to significantly increase (more than doubling resource requirements) during the next several years with approved initiatives.

The intention to establish the Sun servers and the Solaris operating system as the Agencys standard platform for the distributed Websphere infrastructure servers serves two purposes. It avoids costs associated with acquiring, training and retaining additional staff to manage and maintain other vendor equipment and software; and, it establishes a homogenous, distributed Websphere Web systems environment for the Enterprise Information Technology framework as outlined in OMB Circular A-130. The Sun infrastructure currently being purchased is scalable, with capacity that can be upgraded, and should have a 4 to 5-year useful life. At the end of that period, and with an analysis of the Agencys progress in implementing a mainframe-based Websphere environment, SSA will review its requirements for the distributed Websphere application infrastructure. If appropriate, as time and budget for technology upgrade of the entire cluster permit, SSA will conduct a competitive acquisition upgrade of the infrastructure hardware and software.

Organizations that wish to disagree with SSAs intent to establish the aforesaid Agency standard must submit their responses within 15 days of this publication. Responses must present clear and convincing rationale in order for them to be considered (i.e., simple marketing information will not be considered a valid response). Pricing data is not requested or required.

This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, submitted information will be used in SSAs final assessment of its decision to establish this standard. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information. Responses to this notice should be submitted electronically to Megan.Robey@ssa.gov and refer to SSA Sun Server Standard.
