<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department), Office of Migrant Education (OME) is seeking a contractor with the capability to support the procurement titled: the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) Development and Maintenance. As part of its mission, OME uses MSIX to support the exchange of migrant student records from one school district to another as migrant students move within State or across State lines. This investment is in response to the Congressional mandate in Section 1308(b) of Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended. Section 1308(b) requires the Secretary to assist States in developing effective methods for electronically exchanging student records amongst States; and, to determine, and accurately account for, the number of migratory children in each State. The MSIX investment consists of a responsive web-based platform that links States' migrant student record databases to facilitate the national exchange of migrant students' educational and health information.<br />The MSIX investment has four goals. These goals include exchanging education and health data; promoting the use of MSIX; ensuring the utilization of the consolidated records for enrollment, placement, and credit accrual, as well as producing national data on the migrant population. The primary beneficiaries of MSIX investments are the migrant students and State Migrant Education Program (MEP) grantees. <br />Because MSIX is a comprehensive technology platform and a major investment for the Department, the scope encompasses Contractor support to provide Project Management, System Operations, Cyber Security Management, Customer Support Help Desk, Issue Tracking and Trouble Ticket Management, Asset Management, State Support and Technical Assistance for MSIX.

<p>a) Ensure the MSIX remains fully functional and stable (e.g. bug-fixes, security upgrades, software patches), and complete all required system, hardware and software upgrades in a timely manner. Note: all upgrades or enhancements shall be coordinated with the Department.<br />b) Interface daily with MSIX users and other MSIX personnel via the MSIX Help Desk to maintain a high quality of support for MSIX. Responsibilities shall include system usage training for users, and rapid response to all technical problems reported to the Contractor by users or by MSIX staff.<br />c) Be expected to install and maintain all MSIX software and hardware components and keep track of them via an automated reporting and tracking tool (Note: The Contractor should include the tracking tool in the proposal and describe its features and functionality.) <br />d) Perform Help Desk Support &amp; Trouble Ticket Management tasks required to meet expected service levels and to support the end users of the MSIX. <br />e) Meet related system security and privacy requirements.<br />f) Support the Department's initiated MSIX staff training initiatives.<br />g) Adhere to all Federal Government, Department of Education regulations, directives and standards related to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), Privacy Act, Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-130 and A-123, among other applicable policies.</p>
<p>The Department anticipates the release of the subject solicitation during the week of October 31, 2016.</p>
<p>It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101 and will be solicited as a Request for Proposal (RFP) through FBO. This procurement will be awarded in accordance with procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.1 (Acquisition of Commercial Items - General) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation).

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E226, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), Department of Health Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, 151 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9SZ, UK for "Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD): A UK Resource for Cancer Epidemiology Research."</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 519130 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract with a 12 month base plus two 12 month option periods.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Period of Performance will be as follows:</p>
<p>BASE YEAR - November 27, 2016 - November 26, 2017<br />OPTION YEAR ONE - November 27, 2017 - November 26, 2018<br />OPTION YEAR TWO - November 27, 2018 - November 26, 2019</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a 1 year academic full license with options for two additional years to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database that will allow DCEG investigators full access to the content of the database. CPRD will facilitate NCI access to linkable information from other UK resources.</p>
<p>CPRD is the world's largest longitudinal database of primary care medical records containing 13 million individuals (5 million of them are active patients), contributing 1.5 billion clinical records, and more than 1 billion therapy records. The age, gender, and death rate distribution of the CPRD population is similar to that of the UK general population, minimizing selection bias and maximizing results' generalizability. In contrast to other available large registry databases, the collected information in CPRD was not intended for medical billing purposes but for detailed clinical epidemiological investigation. Specifically, CPRD data contain clinical diagnoses, results of diagnostic testing, specialist referrals, prescription information, and lifestyle factors. Additional information can be collected through physician questionnaires. The data is currently linkable to other population-based registries, including the National Cancer Intelligence Network, the UK Hospital Episode Statistics, Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Data, and Patient and Practice-based Deprivation Data. The database will serve the scientific needs of several investigators across branches in DCEG in conducting cancer epidemiology research.</p>
<p>In an attempt to compare available resources that may serve DCEG investigator interest, NCI used the Cancer Control and Population Sciences website (http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/pharm/pharmacoepi_db/) that provides a description of a long list of US-based and international healthcare database; some of them are already available to DCEG. Comparing across databases showed that CPRD provides the largest longitudinal primary care medical records with some unique features including complete prescription records, available laboratory test results and lifestyle factors. Additional research by NCI investigators has identified CPRD as a widely used recourse by academic institutes, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies in the UK and the US. Thus, the proposed Contractor provides a unique resource that meets the scientific requirement for DCEG research needs. NCI knows of no other vendor that can provide the services that meet all of the requirements as specified above.</p>
<p>For this acquisition, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Provide NCI with a 1 year full access license to the CRPD Gold database. <br />2. Provide necessary training and data-related documentations to NCI, as needed throughout the contract period. <br />3. Provide epidemiological support for data users. <br />4. Provide day-to-day troubleshooting for technical problems related to data access. <br />5. Facilitate linkage to other UK resources.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 4:00 PM EST, on November 9, 2016. All responses and questions can be emailed to Kimesha Leake, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at kimesha.leake@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N01CP72502-24 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><strong>Presolicitation Notice Information</strong>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology, leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS (DAIDS), has a requirement for the operation of the Nonhuman Primate Core Humoral immunology Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development. The current Nonhuman Primate Core Humoral immunology Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development (under Contract No. HHSN27220110016C) is held by Duke University.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the development of therapies, vaccines, and prevention strategies. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models present the opportunity to test a variety of candidate AIDS vaccines, optimizing their ability to elicit immune responses and testing their ability to prevent infection or to control virus replication after virus challenge. NIAID supports NHP studies through both contract and grant mechanisms. <br /><br />DAIDS provides immunological and virological support for NHP studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites and by AIDS vaccine researchers through three Nonhuman Primate Immunology and Virology Laboratories for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development (NHP Core Labs) contracts. The objective of these Core Laboratories has been to ensure standardization and comparability of the assays conducted for preclinical NHP studies and to provide a common basis for assessment of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate HIV and SIV vaccines. The current Nonhuman Primate Core Humoral Immunology Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development contract (under Contract No. HHSN272201100016C) is held by Duke University.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The purpose of the proposed contract is to conduct, develop, acquire, improve, and implement assays to evaluate and characterize the humoral immune responses of nonhuman primates (NHP) that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV, in studies conducted by the NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) or by investigators supported by or collaborating with NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements</strong><br />The Contractor shall conduct, develop, acquire, improve, and implement assays to evaluate and characterize the humoral immune responses of NHP that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV in studies conducted by the NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) or by investigators supported by or collaborating with NIH. The Contractor shall use state-of-the-art assays under this contract to detect and evaluate humoral immune responses generated in nonhuman primates by immunization with AIDS vaccines or by infection with SIV or SHIV. This shall include assays to optimize detection of neutralizing antibodies and assays to optimize the detection of non-neutralizing antiviral activities in immunized and infected animals. Assays shall incorporate appropriate positive and negative controls to define background and dynamic range, and shall demonstrate reproducibility and consistency.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: 1) furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed, to perform the requirements of the contract; (2) perform humoral immunology assays; (3) receive, store, catalog, track, and maintain an inventory of the specimens to be evaluated; (4) manage and report study data; (5) perform project management activities in support of contract activities; (6) conduct initial and final transition activities, as needed; and (6) perform optional work, as described below, if required.</p>

The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base period) plus six (6) one year options (terms that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally), for a total possible performance period of up to seven (7) years, beginning on or about December 29, 2017. The performance requirement will be the delivery of 10.53 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and 10.53 FTEs per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7). If Options 1-6 are exercised, the services required will be the same as provided during the Base period.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options to accommodate unanticipated increases in demand, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Options 7 - 20: Increased Level of Effort:</strong> The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 1.0 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) for each option exercised. These options may be exercised twice per year during Years 1 through 7. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Base Period or Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p><strong>2. Options 21 - 27: Increased Level of Effort:</strong> The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.5 FTE for each option exercised. It is anticipated that only one option will be exercised per performance year. The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Base Period or Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 5, 2017. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the proposer to make certain the proposal is properly received by SERDP. Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals or travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the SERDP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $700,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $700,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at http://www.usace.army.mil/ HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

<DESC>Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Medical Provider Component
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p><br />A. Background</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 "to enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care services and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions and in the organization, financing and delivery of health care services)." In 1999, Congress, in its reauthorization language, stated that the Director of the AHRQ "shall conduct and support research and build private-public partnerships to (1) identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery; (2) develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and (3) disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry."</p>
<p>The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component (HC), Medical Provider Component (MPC), and Insurance Component (IC), which began in 1996, is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals (MEPS-HC), their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.) (MEPS-MPC), and employers across the United States (MEPS-IC). MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers. For further discussion of the MEPS family of surveys as well as historical context please see: http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The primary objective of the MPC is to collect data from medical providers (hospitals, physicians, home care agencies, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities) on expenditures for medical services provided to MEPS Household Component (HC) sample persons. Such data are essential to improve the accuracy of the national medical expenditure estimates derived from the MEPS HC, since household respondents are not always the most reliable source of information on medical expenditures. The data also serve as the primary imputation source of medical expenditure data to correct for the item nonresponse on this measure by the MEPS household sample participants. MPC data also serve as an imputation source for item nonresponse to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures. They also serve as source of expenditure information on physician charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital, as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients. <br /><br />C. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Providers for the MPC sample for one year includes all hospitals, emergency rooms, home care agencies, outpatient departments, pharmacies, and long term health care facilities reported by HC respondents, as well as all physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital (these physicians are identified by the hospitals not the HC respondents). HMOs are included in the MPC data collection. Office based medical providers where the provider is either a doctor of medicine (MD) or Osteopathy (DO) or practices under the direct supervision of an MD or DO are included in the MPC as well. Data collection consists of contacting and collecting data from approximately 5,500 hospitals, 13,000 office-based providers, 600 home care providers, and 100 institutions, 20,000 physicians who provide services for patients in hospitals but bill separately from the hospital, and 8,000 pharmacies. Data collection methods may include phone, fax, mail, self-administration, and electronic transmission (including CD-ROMS and secure transmission via FTP and email). Each year of the MPC, all providers shall be screened to ascertain their eligibility, their association with the MEPS household respondent, and to obtain information to facilitate the conduct of the core MPC interview. Currently, an Integrated Data Collection System (IDCS) that includes a Web component in which the MEPS-MPC forms are programmed for computer-assisted data entry (CADE) and a case management system (CMS) is used for data collection. Recruiting, training and managing a data collection staff that includes staff with phone data collection skills and staff with the ability to abstract data from financial and medical records is expected. The sample of the MEPS MPC is designed to provide data on events for which household respondents are less likely to be fully aware of the financial transactions regarding the medical care received, to enrich the sample of events available as donors for imputation, and to provide a basis for methodological analysis of household reported payments for all types of events. The contractor shall also develop specifications for matching data collected in the Medical Provider Component with complementary data collected in the Household Component. The Contractor shall organize the data collected in the MPC into data files usable with the SAS statistical software package with documentation. The contractor shall produce and deliver internal MPC files that include matched and unmatched data and produce matched files in the prescribed format and necessary matching variables and documentation. Appropriate security measures must be demonstrated with regards to maintaining the confidential protection of data collected.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following types of services under this contract:</p>
<p>&bull; Survey/project management</p>
<p>o Continue operation of MEPS MPC<br />o Preparation of MEPS MPC documentation<br />o Liaison and cooperation with MEPS principals<br />o Cooperation and liaison with the HC contractor assuring timely, accurate and complete file transfers so the HC contractor can complete editing/imputation work (for all files but prescribed medicines) and public use file development for all MEPS event files on schedule<br />o Cooperation with AHRQ to obtain clearances<br />o Meeting arrangements<br />o Project closeout/transfer of operations<br />o Reporting, work planning, management meetings</p>
<p>&bull; Data Collection</p>

<CONTACT>Michael J Wong, Contracting Specialist, Phone 8508820058, Email michael.wong.9@us.af.mil - Jonathan Cansdale, Contracting Officer, Phone 8508830828, Email jonathan.cansdale.4@us.af.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Armament Directorate, is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small businesses that are capable of continuing development of the Weapons Planning Software (WPS) suite based on Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) architecture WITHIN current, mission-critical development timelines (detailed below).</p>
<p>WPS provides PC-based weapon mission planning capabilities covering numerous aircraft/weapon platforms (both US- and foreign-made). The WPS suite is used by Department of Defense (DoD) organizations and foreign countries using JMPS for precision guided munition (PGM) planning. Any interested vendors must be able to continue development/sustainment of JMPS-compatible software common components supporting PGM mission planning requirements.</p>
<p>There are currently two versions of WPS in development based on multiple software compatibility requirements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) WPS 1.X (referred to as Legacy) is functional within the 32-bit JMPS Framework environment and is currently designed up to version 1.6 based on the Mission Planning Requirements Documents (MPRDs). Future development of the WPS 1.X line will be limited to mission-critical fixes and routine sustainment with minimal focus on additional capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) WPS 2.X will be functional in both the 32-bit JMPS Framework and the future 64-bit JMPS Framework and will be approximately 30% complete by mid-2017. The requirements for WPS 2.X are defined in the WPS System Requirements Document (SRD). The timeline for rollout of WPS version 2.0 (non-Network Enabled Weapon support) and version 2.1 (includes Network Enabled Weapon support) is March 2018 and March 2019 respectively. Due to mission impact across numerous aircraft/weapon platforms, these timelines have very little flexibility (if any), so interested vendors will need to explain how they will maintain progress while adhering to the existing schedule.</p>
<p>Note: To obtain a copy of the SRD &amp; MPRD referenced above, contact the point of contact identified below. Offerors must officially request these documents in writing, via email. To validate the documentation release, the request must include: the company name, mailing address, email address, point of contact, phone number, current CAGE number, active System for Award Management (SAM) registration and an active registration at the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) website http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ to include a copy of the DD Form 2345. The written request must include acknowledgement of the offeror's responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations. The individual requesting and authorized to receive the export-controlled documents on behalf of the U.S. contractor must be the contact/person identified within the JCP system. Any recipient of the export controlled information shall be a U.S. citizen or a person admitted lawfully into the United States for permanent residence and is located in the United States. Upon verification of the offeror's status and acknowledgement of responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations, the requested document package will be provided.</p>
<p>The WPS suite consists of the following four components (additional components may be necessary to support both DoD and allied foreign countries):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software Common Component (PGMPS-CC). Includes mission planning for Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), LASER JDAM, JDAM Enhanced Range (JDAM-ER), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser (WCMD), SDB-II, Long Range Anti Surface Missile (LRASM), Enhanced PAVEWAY II, PAVEWAY IV, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuse (HTVSF), GPS M-Code, Massive Ordinance Penetrator (MOP) and other similar weapon systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) JMPS Target Manager Common Component (JTM-CC). Allows for importing/populating target information for all weapon-types included in the WPS suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Key Handler Common Component (KH-CC). Provides weapons key handling functions for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Weapon Data Link Initialization Common Component (WDLI-CC). Provides weapons data link initialization functions for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW).</p>
<p>In addition, WPS interfaces with the following external mission planning components:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Multiple USAF &amp; USN JMPS Frameworks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Weapon Fly out Models provided by weapon manufacturers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Common Advanced Safe Escape Software<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) GPS Predictor Common Component<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Universal Armament Interface Common Component<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) TaskView<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) PenCalc</p>
<p>WPS development requires establishing and maintaining Associate Contractor Agreements with multiple other developers to ensure access to required technical data and interface documentation.</p>
<p>The Government intends to increase the maximum ceiling on the existing IDIQ contract (FA8677-10-D-0006) from $99,000,000 to $124,000,000. This bridging modification will increase the contract ceiling by $25M but will not extend the ordering period beyond the current ordering period expiration date in September 2018. This ceiling increase will provide enough authority to complete WPS 2.X development which should increase competitive opportunities in the follow-on contract, expected to be in place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Synopsis is for information only. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to competitively procure the continued development of WPS version 2.X (through version 2.1) or to continue development efforts through a ceiling increase under the existing contract. The Government's expectation for future acquisitions involving development/maintenance of the WPS suite is that fewer barriers to competition will exist once version 2.1 is fielded. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The Government will not award a contract solely on the basis of this Sources Sought Notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items/perform this effort to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 541511, Customer Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million dollars. The USAF anticipates future WPS acquisition efforts will utilize an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract format. Delivery orders issued under said IDIQ will typically be awarded using Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and/or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract types as appropriate for each specific requirement. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: All interested vendors shall submit a capabilities statement that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide/perform the requirement stated in this notice. The capabilities statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to perform software development as described above and in the MPRD and SRD within the timelines stated above. The response must not exceed 15 pages.</p>
<p>Small businesses with only partial capabilities of this requirement are encouraged to submit their capabilities statement demonstrating the portion of the requirement they are capable of providing/performing. This information will allow the Government to identify areas of possible breakout or possible subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: michael.wong.9@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FY 17 Weapon Planning Software Sources Sought." If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Eglin Air Force Base. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachment. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, or .xlsx documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding the announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed in this posting. The Government may or may not use any responses to this sources sought as a basis for a subsequent project/requirement. Any project/requirement developed from the sources sought responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps.gov separately. Responses to this sources sought will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to the respondents with respect to any of the information submitted under this sources sought. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; a bid package or solicitation does not exist at this time. In order to protect the integrity of any possible future acquisition, no additional information will be provided and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this sources sought.</p>
<p>Only government employees will review submitted responses to this sources sought. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the Government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contractors include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting their contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>
<p>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 3:00 P.M. (CST) ON 28 NOVEMBER 2016. Direct all questions concerning this requirement to 1st Lt Michael Wong at michael.wong.9@us.af.mil or Mr. Jonathan Cansdale at jonathan.cansdale.4@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>LOCATION: Robins AFB, GA 31098-1813</p>
<p>FBO Post Title: Request for Interested Manufacturers to sole-source purchase of NSN 5985-00-936-6924EW, ALT-16 Antenna</p>
<p>SUBJECT:</p>
<p>Market research is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of the ALT-16 Antenna, NSN 5985-00-936-6924EW, PN 58D2098-35.</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The AN/ALT-16 is a manual jamming transmitter system used on the Air Force B-52H aircraft. This aircraft uses an EW suite that is a federated architecture rather than the integrated model seen on newer platforms. This suite consists of four main types of systems, one of which is manual jamming transmitters. The AN/ALT-16A jamming transmitter is one of the manual jamming transmitters in the suite. There are two systems per aircraft. The forward system has 1 antenna and the aft system has 2 (1 upper and 1 lower). The aft antennae are identical and are the "Christmas trees" on the aircraft fuselage; however, only the lower antenna is used during manual jamming.</p>
<p>Impediment to Competition:</p>
<p>The original equipment manufacturer for this item is Northrop Grumman (CAGE 1LTU5), which maintains its configuration by part number and software version. The Government does not own any data, drawings, schematics, or any other releasable technical data in support of this requirement aside from drawing number 142-5017, which does not include a parts or materials list. As a result, Northrop Grumman is the only known source with adequate knowledge of the ALT-16 Antenna performance requirements and possession of the required technical data and capabilities needed to produce this item and ensure compatibility of the equipment.</p>
<p>INTEREST</p>
<p>The DLA/AWB Contracting Office intends to award a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman for the manufacture of the Antenna in support of the B-52 AN/ALQ-155 Suite. Other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 11 Nov 2016 by emailing kimberly.holland@us.af.mil and/or dla.dlr.proc@us.af.mil. The Government intends to procure these items using Other Than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This sources sought synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal. It does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses in any form are not offers, and the government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this technical description is strictly voluntary.</p>

Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. Multiple awards may be made. All small business set-aside categories will be considered.

<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The M1116 cartridge will augment the currently fielded M1012, which has an effective range of 10 to 20 meters (m). The extended range (30 to 50 m) of the round provides field commanders and soldiers with an enhanced capability, increasing their flexibility with a blunt force trauma that contains a marking effect to target individuals for future identification. The cartridges are intended to be direct fire, low hazard, non-shrapnel producing devices that provides a less than lethal marking effect upon impact. When employed from 12 gauge weapon systems, the cartridges produce non-explosive and less than lethal force to confuse, disorient, or deter the targeted individual without causing catastrophic injuries. The M1116 increases the safe standoff distance between supported units and targets while simultaneously minimizing civilian casualties and collateral damage of people, materiel, and infrastructure.</p>

The underlying factors leading to the failure of public health measures to control pertussis disease using currently licensed vaccines are poorly understood. A more complete understanding of this disease and of the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection is a critical public health need.&nbsp; Currently, the baboon model of pertussis, developed in the laboratories of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is the only animal model of pertussis that recapitulates the disease as observed in human patients. The use of this animal model to study pertussis pathogenesis, evaluate host responses to pertussis infection and vaccination, and evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics require large numbers of weanling baboons be delivered to the CBER primate facility over the study period.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Benjamin T. Shih, Contracting Officer, Phone 2027322584, Email benjamin.shih@ice.dhs.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for the detention, health, welfare, transportation and deportation of alien detainees in removal proceedings, and those subject to final order of removal from the United States.
<p>The mission of the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Program is the planning, management, and direction of broad programs relating to the supervision, detention, and deportation of detainees who are in the United States illegally. These activities are chiefly concerned with the processing and enforcement of departure from the United States of detainees who have entered illegally or have become removable after admission. In implementing its mission, ERO ICE Air Operations Division (IAO) is responsible for carrying out orders for the required departure of detainees handed down in removal proceedings, or prior thereto, and arranging for detention of detainees when such detention becomes necessary. ERO's responsibilities include providing reliable, safe, and secure mass air transportation of alien nationals placed in federal custody.</p>
<p>IAO requires a vendor to provide chartered flight services for daily domestic and international flights predominantly to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America from five (5) operational areas located in Mesa, AZ; Brownsville, TX; Miami, FL; San Antonio, TX; and Alexandria, LA. These daily charter flights each require an aircraft with a minimum of 150 seats with 13 security crewmembers plus a flight nurse, and will require a maximum of approximately 18,000 total annual flight hours. In addition, long range international charter flights using an aircraft with a minimum of 150 seats and minimum range of 2,800NM will also be required for approximately one flight per quarter to international destinations. The anticipated duration of an awarded contract or agreement will be one base year plus four option years.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is being used to collect information about capability of qualified contractors to provide the services as described above and pursuant to the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). Prospective contractors who are qualified to provide these services should provide the following information for ICE's review:</p>
<p>1. Company name<br />2. Company address<br />3. POC information (name, title, phone number, email address, etc.)<br />4. Company business size (annual revenue, number of employees)<br />5. Socio-economic status<br />6. Copy of GSA schedule(s) (if applicable)<br />7. Brief Company Capability statement (to include addressing all needs as stated above). Contractors should specify their prior experience or contracts in the area; they should also specify whether they could be supporting the contract as an broker or owner/operator and expected availability levels of aircraft meeting the requirements laid out in this RFI and the attached SOW.</p>
<p>In addition to the general capabilities of interested firms, ICE requests responses to the following inquiries:</p>
<p>1. Given that the prospective requirement is a consolidation of what were previously multiple requirements, do contractors recommend the Government request multiple fixed hour rates based on operational area and flight type or a single fixed hourly rate? Please provide additional explanation supporting recommendations.</p>
<p>2. How do contractors recommend handling Service Contract Act requirements for a requirement that has national scope of performance?</p>
<p>3. What significant market conditions, trends, and operating constraints should the Government be aware of, which may not be considered in the attached SOW?</p>
<p>4. What items in the SOW are driving up costs for the Government and/or increasing risk for the contractor/Government?</p>
<p>5. Could guaranteed minimums for flight hours result in a reduction of flight hour rates? What level of guaranteed minimum for flight hours could enable a reduction in flight hour rates? What are the estimated minimum required flight hours per aircraft per month?</p>
<p>6. What, if any, recommendations do contractors have for improving performance or lowering the price of the SOW?</p>
<p>7. What cost-saving mechanisms and/or strategic sourcing practices could you use for jet fuel, if any? How best could the Government reimburse vendors for jet fuel costs (e.g., direct reimbursement; built into flight hour rates; varying fuel rates based on an agreed upon market index such as kerosene-type jet fuel commodities)?</p>
<p>8. What, if any, performance metrics would prospective contractors recommend the Government use to measure performance for these services? What incentives could be offered that would most effectively lead to outstanding performance?</p>
<p>9. After reviewing the attached draft SOW and this RFI, do you have any comments or concerns to bring to the Government's attention?</p>
<p>ICE may also seek to gather additional information by hosting an Industry Day at ICE's facilities located in Washington, D.C. at a time and date to be determined.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit all requested information and responses electronically to benjamin.shih@ice.dhs.gov by 4:00 p.m., EST, on November 10, 2016.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN RFI ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes-it does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this announcement, and information submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned.</p>

<p>B.	Title: Microscope Upgrade for Muscle Energetics Laboratory</p>
<p>C.	This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.  All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Kevin Alvarez, Contract Specialist, at kevin.alvarez@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by November 7, 2016 9:00 AM, EASTERN TIME under Solicitation Number: NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-014-KMA. FAXES ARE NOT ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>D.	Information:</p>
<p>1.	Background</p>
<p>The focus of NHLBI's Muscle Energetics Laboratory is to determine how mitochondria are optimized within muscle cells to help maintain energy homeostasis during the large change in energy demand caused by muscle contraction. Recently, the laboratory has demonstrated that skeletal muscle mitochondria form a highly connected network resembling that of an electrical power grid, and, indeed, were capable of electrical conduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential throughout the cell. The discovery of this rapid energy distribution mechanism overturned longstanding ideas regarding diffusion as the primary energy distribution pathway in skeletal muscle. Current work in this area is focused on providing a better understanding of the regulation and development of these mitochondrial networks as well as their role in overall muscle function.</p>
<p>Despite much interest, control of mitochondrial function in vivo remains largely unclear as direct measures of mitochondrial enzymes in live animals have been limited. As a result, another major focus of the lab is to develop and utilize novel, direct measurements of in vivo mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle under different workloads. The goal of these studies is to unravel the signaling cascade involved in the upregulation of mitochondrial energy conversion during muscle contraction.</p>
<p>2.	Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The Muscle Energetics Laboratory is currently using a confocal microscope-a Leica SP5 confocal/multi-photon live animal imaging system-that is outdated and needs to be replaced. The laboratory has determined that the best course of action is to upgrade the current SP5 system to an SP8 MP model at a fraction of the cost to purchase a new SP8 MP system altogether. This upgrade will allow the lab to continue developing cutting edge live animal imaging techniques and significantly increase its capabilities for imaging live cells and tissue sections. The updated microscope system will play a vital part in investigating the relationships between skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and function in the lab.</p>
<p>3.	Project Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall upgrade the Muscle Energetics Laboratory's SP5 confocal microscope to an SP8 MP system. Specifically, the contractor shall replace the lab's DM6 CFS Stand (NHLBI Decal # 01839186), premium workstation (CPU) (NHLBI Decal # 01839162), and monitor (NHLBI Decal # 01839161) with the following SP8 components:</p>
<p>&bull;	DM6 CFS Stand<br /> &bull;	Optical Outfit<br /> &bull;	Scan optics module VISIR with rotation<br /> &bull;	Tandem scanner 8 kHz<br /> &bull;	SP8 LIAchroics Compact RGB<br /> &bull;	One Internal Detector Channel (PMT)<br /> &bull;	Two Internal Detector Channels (HyD)<br /> &bull;	Confocal Lasers 405 nm, 488 nm, 552 nm and 638 nm<br /> &bull;	IR prepard (without IR Laser)<br /> &bull;	Custom Dual Beam Routing for MaiTai HP DeepSee (2)<br /> &bull;	Custom Quad Module for MicroMirror plus Hyd RLD 2ch (system has HyD 2Ch)<br /> &bull;	Premium Workstation, Monitor<br /> &bull;	Beam Splitter Quad LP 560nm<br /> &bull;	Beam Splitter Quad LP 505nm<br /> &bull;	Beam Splitter Quad Empty (for customization)</p>
<p>In addition to providing these components, the contractor shall trade-in the old SP5 Confocal components for cost savings towards the new components.</p>
<p>4.	Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>a.	Contractor must possess the technology, equipment, and materials necessary to safely and accurately convert a Leica SP5 system to an SP8 MP system.<br />b.	Contractor must be able to provide a trade in allowance for old SP5 Confocal components.</p>
<p>5.	Anticipated Period of Performance/Delivery Date</p>
<p>Anticipated delivery date is 45-90 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p>6.	Capability Statement</p>

<DESC><p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) currently maintains a File Repository, located in Springfield, VA, housing a variety of patent and trademark files. The warehouse is in poor condition and is not National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)-compliant.</p>
<p>The USPTO is interested in identifying a new location for its file repository which contains an estimated 607,413 cubic feet of files, moving the existing files (and shelving, if warranted), housing the files in a NARA-compliant facility (or facilities) and maintaining the files in compliance with NARA regulations. Additionally, the USPTO requires that files be retrieved on a regular basis, delivered to requestors, and when ready for return, picked up, returned to the warehouse and refiled. The files must be maintained in accordance with NARA standards and by using an electronic scanning/indexing system that may be accessed by USPTO employees and public users at USPTO facilities to request required files.</p>
<p>Ideally, the USPTO would like to have the files moved to a new facility within an 18-24 month period. However, respondents should provide information as to the feasibility of completing the move within that timeframe and whether the schedule could be more aggressive.</p>
<p><br />2. FILE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The chart in Attachment A identifies files currently maintained at the File Repository, including the general file quantity, number of shelving units that they occupy, cubic feet and percentage of total collection. At this time, due to disposition, the USPTO estimates that there are 607,013 cubic feet of filing in place of which 534,299 cubic feet needs to be proximate and 72,714 cubic feet can be stored further away.</p>
<p>For the files that are deemed proximate, the USPTO intends to request files on a periodic basis. The table included in the attachment to this RFI illustrates the files and cubic feet that need to be stored proximate (and can be delivered upon request) and those that may be stored further away. The table also indicates which records are temporary or permanent and their current and proposed retention schedules.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall assume responsibility for records within the File Repository and securely transport files to a NARA-compliant facility or facilities. The Contractor shall be responsible for ongoing maintenance of files to include application of chain-of-custody controls, advanced technology and tools for tracking, retrieval and reporting, transporting files to NARA when the USPTO requests a file transfer and retrieving files and converting them to scanned files as requested. Work also must include the following:</p>
<p>1. Safeguarding all files, documents, and specimens maintained at the File Repository and those in their possession during transfer to the new facility.</p>
<p>2. Maintaining files by file type and numeric sequence.</p>
<p>3. Replacing boxes containing files when existing boxes are worn or are in disrepair. All files maintained in boxes should be of the same file type/records series and disposition, and in sequential order.</p>
<p>4. Replacing bar code labels when existing labels are no longer readable or have been torn off the file wrapper.</p>
<p>5. Forwarding unusable file wrappers (i.e., those beyond repair) to the designated USPTO program office for replacement.</p>
<p>6. Inventorying files to update changes in location.</p>
<p>7. Transferring files to NARA on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by NARA.</p>
<p>8. Partnering with the USPTO to maintain files per its Records Retention Schedules.</p>
<p>9. Providing an electronic database for use in file tracking, generating barcode labels for files, boxes and locations, and providing reports.</p>
<p>10. Digitization must meet NARA technical standards.</p>
<p>4. RESPONSES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following information for consideration by the USPTO.</p>
<p>1. Planning Phase - provide documentation as to how you propose to coordinate with the USPTO on file transference, maintaining files wile transition is underway, and reporting methodology. Please also share the anticipated timing for the planning phase prior to move execution beginning as well as the move execution duration.</p>
<p>2. Provide location(s) of NARA-compliant warehouse space and confirmation that it meets with the necessary regulations.</p>
<p>3. Note the amount of space needed per an evaluation of the information.</p>
<p>4. Provide the total anticipated annual cost of the contract, including subtotals for the facilities costs, move planning and execution, file maintenance, scanning for requested files and transportation of files to NARA when disposition schedules warrant accession.</p>
<p>5. Elaborate on your records systems and compliance with NARA.</p>
<p>6. Transportation methodology - Provide information how you plan to box up and transfer files.</p>
<p>7. Provide information as to knowledge and capability for records disposition.</p>
<p>8. Elaborate on digitization and indexing capability to meet NARA requirements.</p>
<p>9. Share information on a proposed timeframe for record retrieval and delivery to USPTO Alexandria campus or Randolph Square location on a request basis. We are currently working with a 4-hour turnaround from receipt of the request (or next business day if received after noon).</p>
<p>10. Provide any other strong considerations or concerns.</p>

<RESPDATE>110916
<CONTACT>Isaac Bellamy, Contract Specialist, Email isaac.bellamy@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF) are seeking a qualified business to perform the following requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  HHS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>This Notice is issued solely for information and market research purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. Furthermore, those who respond to this Notice should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission. This Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. ORR is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this Notice. All costs associated with responding to this Notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Section 462, transferred responsibilities for the care and placement of unaccompanied children from the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to ORR. Since then, ORR has incorporated child welfare values as well as the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorization acts, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides temporary shelter care and other related services to unaccompanied children (UC), in ORR's custody. Shelter care services begin once ORR accepts a child for placement and ends when the minor is released from ORR's custody. Shelter care and other related services are provided in the least restrictive setting appropriate for the child's age and special needs. In the spring of 2015, ORR awarded multiple IDIQ contracts for unique service areas to support UC shelter care needs at temporary influx shelters.  The market research obtained from this notice will help ORR obtain identify potential sources capable of providing the services required to a temporary influx of unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>In preparation for future influxes of unaccompanied children, ORR seeks information that it may use to develop options for contract surge capacity to shelter and care for these children on a time-limited and expandable basis as needed. Due to the nature of unaccompanied children arrivals, ORR seeks sources for a contract vehicle that is flexible, cost-efficient, and comprehensive operations of ORR identified locations. There is a potential for multiple locations to be simultaneously operational, within 30 business days, with a combined capacity to serve up to 5,000 unaccompanied children, 13-17 years of age.</p>
<p>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>ORR requests information that it may use to develop options for indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide for an indefinite quantity of the specified services for a fixed time. The potential competition and award of a five-year (base year plus four option years) IDIQ contract could provide comprehensive surge capabilities for future influx of children and should provide for appropriate cost/pricing arrangements by the award of task order for services on an as-needed basis.  Due to the nature of unaccompanied children arrivals, ORR seeks sources for a contract vehicle that is flexible, cost-efficient, and could provide the following services on a regional basis throughout the United States. Below are the components required for shelter operations:</p>
<p>Staffing to provide the following:</p>
<p>o   Management and coordination of shelter operations and ensures compliance with ORR policies (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied).</p>
<p>o   Line-of-sight supervision of children at all times.</p>
<p>o   Case management services, facilitate safe and timely discharge of UC from custody and maintain documentation in accordance with federal requirements.</p>
<p>o   Conduct mental health assessments, human trafficking screening, crisis intervention and individual and group counseling services.</p>
<p>o   On-site medical clearance, triage and administer vaccinations.</p>
<p>o   Escort UC for discharge or to other facilities, medical appointments, community services and court appearances.</p>
<p>o   Educational services in adherence to ORR requirements.</p>
<p>o   Training for staff on ORR policies and procedures governing the care and placement of UC.</p>
<p>Support Services:</p>
<p>o   Nutritional services in accordance with United States Department of Agriculture and HHS nutritional guidelines. This includes accommodation of dietary restrictions, food allergies, health issues, and religious or spiritual dietary requirements.</p>
<p>o   Maintenance and facility preparation including linens and laundry, recreational equipment and custodial services. Also fencing for the property, painting and building repairs, industrial cleaning, addressing non-ADA compliance factors, and other preparations needed to accommodate the sheltering of children in the facilities. Depending on the needs of the facility, services could include portable toilets and hand washing stations, mobile trailers for offices.</p>
<p>o   Security services including unarmed security guards and any equipment, such as closed-circuit television networks and communication devices as directed by the government.</p>
<p>o   Clothing, hygiene kits and medical supplies for UC.</p>
<p>o   Transportation services, ground and air for the purpose of discharging UC from custody as well as to appointments, such as medical and dental appointments, immigration court hearings, or community services.</p>

Harris Corporation, DBA Harris Government Communications Systems Division is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the FLV terminal and is the only responsible source capable of providing the CBSP FLV terminal, engineering services, and provisioning item requirements without incurring unacceptable delays in meeting the Governments ship installation schedule. Harris is the only firm that can provide a CBSP FLV terminal that has successfully passed contractor qualification testing and Government environmental and operational testing to be qualified for shipboard use. The Government estimates the time required for another source to complete contractor qualification testing and Government environmental and operational testing is 35 months.  A 35 month delay would result in cancellation of the scheduled FLV installations in Government fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020.  Cancellation of these installations and continued reliance on existing SATCOM systems that are at end-of- service life increases the risk that vital SATCOM capabilities may be unavailable to support Fleet operational requirements. Additionally, the Government anticipates the time to establish the above CBSP FLV engineering services capabilities would take a new contractor a minimum of eighteen (18) months.  An eighteen (18) month gap in engineering services would introduce risk to the Government by not having an established contractor with the capability to repair and maintain the FLV systems. Command and Control functions including NIPR, SIPR, and Network Centric Operations at sea would be degraded if an FLV system were to fail in the fleet and engineering services were not available.  This would directly impact a ships capability to deliver mission critical data and imagery to warfighters and theater commanders. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334220.  Responses to this announcement should be addressed to Christopher J. Murr at Christopher.murr@navy.mil no later than 11am Pacific Standard Time on 14 November 2016.

<DESC>CHIGNIK HARBOR BREAKWATER REPAIRS, CHIGNIK, ALASKA
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this project lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the Government from other sources.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The project is to perform repairs on the existing north and south breakwaters at Chignik Harbor which are 304 feet and 1,279 feet in length, respectively. Repairs will be made by placing additional armor stone on the breakwaters. Approximately 40% of the existing armor stone is deteriorating and disintegrating due to poor quality of the original rock. The majority of the deterioration is on seaward side of breakwaters and the repair plan is to selectively replace damaged or missing armor stones with new armor stones of higher durability. There will be no demolition or removal of existing armor stone. Due to the condition of the existing armor stone, it is anticipated that equipment will not be permitted on the breakwaters and that rock placement will be from marine-based equipment. There is no government furnished or designated rock source for this project. The existing rock was produced at a local quarry however due to the poor quality of the existing rock, it is not anticipated that the local quarry, if operational, will be approved for use on this project.</p>
<p>Average weight of the new armor stone is anticipated to be approximately 4,500 pounds per stone. The Government anticipates awarding a contract with an initial scope requiring placement of an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 tons of armor stone and two options to each place a similar additional quantity of armor stone.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price contact. Construction wage rates (Davis-Bacon Act) will apply.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Heavy and Other Civil Construction, and the related size standard is $36.5 Million. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project (base plus all options) is anticipated to be $10 - $25 Million. The type of contract will be firm-fixed price.&nbsp; The Contractor shall comply with commercial and industry standards as well as all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and procedures.</p>
<p>The intent of this Sources Sought is to research qualified firms with a primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 237990, which has a size standard of $36.5 million. In accordance with FAR 19.501 paragraph (c) The contracting officer shall conduct market research and review the acquisition to determine if this acquisition will be set aside for small business, or considered for an award to a small business under the 8(a) Program (see Subpart 19.8), HUBZone (see Subpart 19.13) or service-disabled veteran-owned programs (see Subpart 19.14).</p>

The Mobile Regional Contracting Center proposes to utilize a diverse mix of contractors via Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs). A determination regarding the potential for small business set-asides will be based on the information and interest received as a result of this notice. Potential contracts are anticipated to have a nation-wide scope of all MEDCOM research labs, but may be structured by region/geographic area, based on the information received as a result of this notice. Medical Research and Materiel Command is not geographically based, but includes all Army medical research labs; with facilities at the following installations: Ft Detrick, MD (to include Forest Glen Annex); Natick, MA; Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; Ft Rucker, AL; and Joint Base San Antonio, TX.</p>
<p><br />The repair/minor construction contracts are intended to provide quick response for performing repair and minor construction relating, but not limited, to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, security and safety areas of medical research laboratory facilities in a cost effective manner. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of the functional operation of medical research facilities, relating to the efficient use of the facility, equipment, facility support systems, and building structures. Since the facilities will be in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the laboratories and support facilities, and will be required to comply with requirements of a number of regulatory and accrediting bodies such as the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The facilities to be covered by the intended contract include Bio-safety Levels (BSL)-2, 3, and 4 research laboratories and laboratory support functions, Animal Bio-safety Levels (ABSL) -2, 3, and 4 animal holding facilities for small and large species to include non-human primates and vivarium facilities, veterinary treatment facilities, public health/analytical laboratories, field laboratories (dry labs),<br />food analysis and diagnostic laboratories, laboratories working with chemical agents, and facilities that use specialized equipment/chambers. MEDCOM laboratories focus on research, development, testing and evaluation of medical products related to health hazards associated with aviation, tactical combat vehicle systems, selected weapons systems, airborne operations, environmental hazards, combat casualty care (trauma, burn and critical care), medical hazards of laser radiation, and exposure to extreme thermal conditions (heat, cold, high terrestrial altitude). The performing contractor's personnel will be required to meet security and health screening requirements. In addition, there may be facilities or portions of facilities that require medical testing and/or immunization of Contractor employees, beyond basic OSHA requirements, before the employees are<br /><br />authorized to work in the controlled room, area, or facility. This requirement may be due to the containment requirements in bioresearch laboratories, the potential for exposure of workers to toxins or communicable diseases, etc. Work may range from reconfiguration of a single room or repair of a single utility system component to renovation of a facility functional area to include both repair of failed and failing systems and components, and minor construction of new systems and components. The range for each anticipated project is between $1,000 to $500,000. Total capacity over the potential five year life of the contract (base year plus four option years) is not to exceed $50,000,000.</p>

<DESC>OI&T RFI supporting Digital Health Platform Initiative 
Title:  Advisory Assistance Support Services   Request for Information.
This is a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs is not at this time seeking proposals.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  However, these results will be used to satisfy the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127.  Please ensure your company name, address, main point of contact, socioeconomic status, and capability to comply with any limitation of subcontracting/non-manufacturer rule clauses/provisions are provided.  Please ensure any proprietary information submitted as part of your response is appropriately marked as such.

In order to support the transformational agenda set out in the Blueprint of Excellence and executed through MyVA strategies, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) desires a Next Generation Digital Health Platform that is integrated, future-proof and optimizes the cost of operations. To achieve these goals, VA is considering the establishment of an interoperable digital health platform that leads to Easier Access to Care for the Veteran, Better Outcomes for the Veteran and more efficient operations for the VHA. The platform needs to seamlessly support key processes in the following core business areas:

Veteran Engagement
Clinical Care Management
Healthcare Operations Management
Health and Operational Analytics

Addressing only one part of the problem such as establishing an Electronic Health Record for the Clinical Care Management process without accounting for its relationship with other systems such as a Supply Chain system will have but only a limited impact to the problem that VA aspires to solve. VA anticipates a need to adopt a platform approach to accomplish this objective. The proposed architecture for the Next Generation Digital Health Platform takes this into account and goes beyond the Electronic Health Record and includes five strategic, integrated components:

One Electronic Health Record system (EHR),
One Operation Management Platform consisting of one resource allocation, financial, supply chain, and human resources system that are integrated seamlessly with the EHR, 
One Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system,
One Analytics system,
One  Application Programming Interface (API) Framework that provides seamless interoperability with internal and external systems

Successfully put together, the platform, should enable real-time, enterprise wide visibility into operations, patients, resources and analytics   to eliminate waste, reduce latencies out of workflows, accelerate business processes, and maximize the use of assets and human resources. A broad range of industries from commerce, to education, to transportation are revolutionizing their areas by leveraging the nexus of technologies such as mobility, internet, cloud, analytics & API s.  The Digital Health platform proposes to leverage a similar nexus of technologies to bring revolutionary changes to healthcare   chronic care management, preventive care, care coordination, personalized therapies, and remote care delivery.  The platform will support the MyVA framework for modernizing VHA s culture, processes, and capabilities to allow VA to continue to put the needs, expectations, and interests of Veterans and their families first, and put Veterans in control of how, when, and where they wish to be served. 

This RFI solicits input on advisory assistance support services, which may include providing assistance in the documentation and implementation of the specifics of an operating model to execute the strategies and tactics necessary to achieve the VA Mission through the Digital Health Platform.  Advisory assistance support services will frame the Service Level  Agreements, Governance framework,  Performance Work Statement (PWS) scope with tasks and associated deliverables to support the vision of the DHP framework by providing identified set of resources, which include comprehensive subject matter expertise (SMEs).  The support services may also include assistance in determining the expected number of resources based on mixed labor categories and labor rates of full time employees (FTEs) to support the DHP initiative.  The support services may provide coverageon specific issues related to government, healthcare and technology.  

VA also desires advisory assistance support services with a clear understanding of the need for peer-to-peer/deep-dive collaboration, enterprise-widesolutions pertaining to DHP, implementation, andnetworkingwith other public and private sector experts to gather real-worldinsight and information, which VA can utilize to better understand variables effecting technology decisions and best-practice approaches in an effort to improve the VA s mission objectives in alignment with healthcare needs and mitigate risk to the Veteran and the organization.  Some assistance support services may also include:  evaluating complex data, providing summary reports, preparing articles and presentation materials, and other documents through the use of outlines, drafts, and resource material; providing complex project and issue related analysis and providing recommendations as required; conducting formal presentations to audiences of variable expertise, and participating in a number of projects dealing with a wide area of ODHP related issues including researching, analyzing and proposing complete and robust management methodologies based on Private-Public sector partnerships. 

Your input and suggestions could include but are not limited to addressing the following areas:

What specific experience or best practices can you share concerning effectively building performance work statements, request for proposals for complex cloud based systems and/or Private Software as a Service frameworks like the Digital Health Platform.

What experience do you have documenting business cases, request for proposals and performance work statements when a public private partnership is being considered?

What experience do you have in developing the frameworks, governance and accountability systems for public private partnerships including MOU s and other partnership contractual artifacts?

What experience do you have with developing and implementing risk management frameworks that are capable of effectively assessing and managing risk profiles including but not limited to cultural/change management risks, technology risks, financial risks and operational risks?

What experience can you share with the government concerning the cost estimation best practices for executing a program such as DHP?

What experience do you have in effectively establishing key performance indicators that would ensure the VA is properly measuring the effectiveness of the platform in supporting veteran engagement, clinical care management and health care operations? 

Vendors may also submit additional information not specifically requested, above, which would provide value and insight to the Government however; responses will be limited to 15 pages.  Please do not submit general capability statements, marketing materials, or other nonspecific information.  

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 15 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the above information by 11:59PM ET on November 28, 2016, via the Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA).

<SOLNBR>FA8808-17-R-0002
<RESPDATE>111816
<CONTACT>Shane Manuel, Contracting Officer, Phone 3106539294, Email shane.manuel.1@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications Systems (MILSATCOM) Directorate (MC), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction: The United States Government (USG) is pursuing a series of five (5) Pathfinders in support of future Commercial Satellite Communication (COMSATCOM) procurements supporting Department of Defense (DoD) operations. The COMSATCOM Pathfinder series is developing the business and technical capabilities necessary for the USG to more effectively access available satellite communication (SATCOM) resources for the warfighter worldwide. The COMSATCOM Pathfinder series will demonstrate a new paradigm of procuring pre-launch transponder(s) to influence Industry to add desired military capabilities to future COMSATCOM systems while working with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation. Likewise, starting with PF #3 the government is introducing the concept of pooled ground which is defined below. When referencing "ground" throughout this Request for Information (RFI), the USG is referring to a teleport, hub, and backhaul network.</p>
<p>Pathfinder #1 (PF #1) demonstrated the business practice of purchasing COMSATCOM with the procurement of two Ku-band transponders over Africa. Although PF #1 achieved its goals for affordability, the purchased transponders were limited in coverage area and diversity of user base due to limited ground entry point access. Pathfinder #2 (PF #2) will procure pre-launch transponders to maximize affordability and influence future COMSATCOM systems while working with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation. PF #3 will build upon the PF #2 strategy by replicating the concept in an Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) region. Additionally PF #3 will address the ground issue seen in PF #1 by including a ground segment able to support the satellite pooled bandwidth across the contracted region or Reference Coverage Area (RCA).</p>
<p>2.0 COMSATCOM PF #3: PF #3 will be a competitive acquisition with the procurement of one or more pre-launch, offeror-selected transponders. The USG will then work with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation, which will provide OCONUS coverage to a defined RCA. This process will demonstrate continued investment based affordability techniques and radically improve coverage flexibility by providing access to pooled portable bandwidth across a challenging OCONUS inter-COCOM setting. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) and the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) are collaborating to determine the OCONUS RCA. For the purpose of this RFI, SMC will bound the RCA to European Command (EUCOM), Africa Command (AFRICOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM) regions or potentially a combination of these COCOMs. This RCA is subject to change and will be defined further in future requests. In addition, the USG is exploring alternatives to accessing ground segment capacity through either: 1) the procurement of antennas, 2) acquiring teleport RF and ground network capacity pooling, 3) managed services, or 4) other options deemed feasible by Industry. The intent is to demonstrate the process of procuring ground segment assets as part of a series of risk mitigation steps towards a pooled portable ground segment. These steps are as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Investment Approach: The procurement of an offeror-selected satellite transponder(s) and/or ground assets afford multiple purposes. The approach demonstrates a long term investment within a constellation or RCA, provides a platform for transponder component demonstration, provides a commercial capability for pooled global bandwidth across a service provider's constellation, and provides a supporting ground segment in the coverage area to efficiently use acquired bandwidth.</p>
<p>2.2 Acquiring Bandwidth/Capacity Phase: The primary goal of PF #3 is to achieve affordability and flexibility of COMSATCOM for the USG. The Air Force will purchase one or more pre-launch transponders and work with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their bandwidth pool. A similar process (by procuring ground assets) will take place for the ground segment contingent within the Offeror's coverage area. Portions of the pool will then be requested, and provided as availability dictates to users throughout the RCA.</p>
<p>2.3 Execution of Bandwidth Allocation: Once the contract is awarded, USSTRATCOM will manage the satellite bandwidth and ground segment assets, and determine which users will have access to the bandwidth/capacity. The government is looking for provider/operator support/input for PF #3 to enable this rapid change in satellite connectivity for a given user.</p>
<p>2.4 Enhancements: The USG implemented CNSSP-12 compliance and anti-burnout enhancements as a requirement for PF #2 with the goal to influence Industry to include these enhancements on future satellites. For PF #3, the USG is encouraging Industry to provide recommendations on other potential enhancements that would be applicable to meet military needs.</p>
<p>3.0 Pooled Portable Satellite Bandwidth: The Total Bandwidth Pool consists of the sum of a Reserved Bandwidth Pool and a Subject to Availability (STA) Bandwidth Pool. The Reserved Bandwidth Pool is dedicated to the USG for the contract Period of Performance (PoP), where the RCA is a subset of OCONUS (defined in section 2.0). The STA Bandwidth Pool is bandwidth that is allocated to the USG on an as-needed and as-available basis over the Offeror's constellation. The amount (in MHz-Months) of the Total Bandwidth Pool is determined by the Offeror. The Total Bandwidth Pool size will most likely be based on each Offeror's unique business case and strategy. The Reserved Bandwidth Pool, in MHz-Months, will be fixed over the contractual period and will expire at the end of that period. The STA Bandwidth Pool will have a starting balance of exactly 1500 MHz-Months, with usable bandwidth as defined by typical commercial specifications and performance. As the USG utilizes the available COMSATCOM services from the Offeror, the balance of the STA Bandwidth Pool will be drawn down on a per use basis. COMSATCOM services via STA bandwidth will be available to the USG until either the contract PoP expires or the balance of the STA Bandwidth Pool is zero.</p>
<p>4.0 Pooled Portable Ground Segment: To prevent limitations for pooled portable satellite bandwidth, PF #3 is expanding from a satellite centric approach to incorporating a pooled portable ground segment that will support warfighters with ground entry point of access. For example, if a warfighter requests satellite access in Afghanistan, the service provider may report they have available satellite bandwidth and provides the warfighter access. However, there may be an inability to provide that service if there is no ground to communicate with that warfighter. One approach is to treat ground in a similar fashion as the on-orbit transponders so as to pool ground capacity in parity with an equivalent ground asset (like an antenna). Another approach is to extend the definition of a portable pool of capability to include satellite and ground connectivity. There are several challenges the USG foresees with either approach. First, achieving parity based on the purchase of a ground asset is less understood than a transponder exchange on a satellite. Second, extending the definition of a portable pool of satellite capability to a portable pool of ground capability for end-to-end capacity is less understood for ground assets. Third, the ground might have the necessary capacity for the requested connectivity (link), but the probability of that ground having a modem that is compatible with the warfighter's modem is negligible, unless pre-planned. Fourth, the data will be routed from the USG networks (e.g., Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) to the warfighter, and the request for this network connectivity (e.g. commercial/USG network peering points, commercial portion of the network capacity) is unknown until the specific satellite access is requested. This would require the compatible ground segment (including apertures, RF equipment, modems, network devices, terrestrial transport, etc.) to be reserved for all possible satellite links and provisioned in near real time. Expanding a pooled portable ground segment across an OCONUS region will likely create additional challenges. The USG is seeking Industry's input on how to create a pooled portable ground approach.</p>
<p>5.0 Questions for Industry: The USAF requests specific feedback to several questions regarding the proposed pooled portable satellite bandwidth concept and a pooled portable ground segment.</p>
<p>5.1 Pooled Portable Satellite Bandwidth:</p>
<p>5.1.1 - What feedback does Industry have on the advantages/disadvantages regarding the type of band for the transponder(s)?</p>
<p>5.1.1.1 - What launches does Industry have planned for the next two to six year time frame?</p>
<p>5.1.2 - Can Industry provide a reasonable (&gt;36 MHz-Month average) amount of Reserved bandwidth within the satellite RCA identified in Section 2.0?</p>
<p>5.1.3 - Does the STA pool with a total value of 1500 MHz-Month seem reasonable to Industry? If not, why?</p>
<p>5.1.3.1 - Is the ratio of Reserved to STA bandwidth a factor in the pricing of the STA capacity?</p>
<p>5.1.3.2 - How would Industry recommend exercising the portability of the Reserved Pool as well as surging in the STA Pool?</p>
<p>5.1.3.3 - Are there business models that would incentivize Industry to be responsive to the portability and surge needed for warfighting requirements? If so, describe those business models.</p>
<p>5.1.3.4 - What would the process look like for managing the provisioning of bandwidth onto a transponder that would be part of the STA process?</p>
<p>5.1.4 - How would COMSATCOM service providers address the process for determining bandwidth, Power Equivalent Bandwidth, Location, Gain over Temperature, and the relevancy of these parameters in determining the value of pooled bandwidth?</p>
<p>5.1.5 - As part of the pooling concept, the USG would like to have users access multiple in-view satellites within a provider's constellation. What ideas does Industry have on how to approach the movement between satellites using existing/enhanced capability inherent in the operator's current infrastructure?</p>
<p>5.1.6 - What alternative deal structures or lessons learned from PF #2 would Industry recommend in order to meet PF #3 objectives?</p>
<p>5.2 Technology Enhancements</p>
<p>5.2.1 - What satellite or ground enhancements would Industry recommend to meet the military's satellite communications needs?</p>
<p>5.2.1.1 - For those recommendations what are Industry's budget estimates or Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to implement?</p>
<p>5.2.2.2 - What issues does Industry foresee with encryption technologies from a satellite and ground perspective?</p>
<p>5.3 Pooled Portable Ground Segment:</p>
<p>5.3.1 - Is it possible to pool ground capacity in support of your or other provider's space bandwidth based on the approaches (or others) outlined in the sections above? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.2 - What challenges can the USG expect to face in implementing a pooled portable ground segment?</p>
<p>5.3.3 - Is it possible to pool the network backhaul to the closest DoDIN entry point? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.4 - Does Industry support USG services today that are routed to the DoDIN? If so, how are those services implemented?</p>
<p>5.3.5 - What would Industry recommend as the process for managing pooled portable ground?</p>
<p>5.3.6 - In reference to the third challenge in Section 4.0 above, what recommendations does Industry have on how a modem pool could be created for Pathfinder #3, and beyond?</p>
<p>5.3.7 - The COMSATCOM Pathfinder vision is supporting the warfighter's connection on a minute-by-minute basis. How would Industry propose optimally pooling ground bandwidth towards this goal? How, as described above, can Industry enhance the user's access to this bandwidth (PF#3 only) through the use of existing command and monitoring capability?</p>
<p>5.3.8 - Can Industry provide the type of modems being used at teleports in the RCA?</p>
<p>5.3.8.1 - Are these modems always in use or can they be shared over time?</p>
<p>5.3.9 - What kind of International challenges such as policies, regulations, Host Nation Agreements etc. can the USG expect to see?</p>
<p>5.3.10 - What are the overall security requirements for a pooled portable ground segment?</p>
<p>5.3.10.1-Does Industry implement Risk Management Framework (RMF) controls? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.11 - What overall feedback does Industry have on the approach to incorporate a pooled portable ground segment?</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.<br /></strong>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes (FAR 15.201(e)) as part of a market survey by the Aviation Development Directorate (ADD). It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. There is no solicitation available at this time. Further, the Army is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. This notice does not commit the US Government to contract for any supplies or services in the future. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary. Failure to respond to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP, if applicable. If a future solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. There will be no compensation by the Government for any cost incurred in providing a response.
<p><br />The Army Contracting Command is issuing this RFI to interested parties on behalf of ADD who is seeking information on reliable, advanced small power systems (RASPS) for primary application to Future Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems (FTUAS). Both system and component level data are sought, which describe candidate technologies of interest, their current capabilities and risks, and component / system level development plans to address known risks and current performance shortfalls. Information on potential power system solutions, associated metrics to pursue, and associated technology maturity will assist the U.S. Army's planning efforts to develop advanced, optimum solutions for future Army Aviation applications.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />The Army is in the planning stages for the development of an FTUAS family of aircraft that at this time is envisioned to consist of a smaller platform that can more easily be transported with and support Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) with operation to 15,000 feet and a larger platform that has characteristics such as having speed parity with current/future manned aircraft with long range and weapons capability that supports the Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) with operation to 25,000 feet. Runway independence will be a critical requirement of these FTUAS. Although a significant amount of conceptual design and mission benefit analysis still needs to be performed to refine this envisioned FTUAS family of aircraft, propulsion technology has been identified as a key enabling technology that needs to be developed for these systems.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong><br />The ADD aims to focus investments on small engine technology unique to military requirements and not duplicative of current industry investments. Such requirements/goals may include but are not limited to: heavy fuel operation, increased reliability, reduced specific fuel consumption, increased horsepower to weight ratio, increased durability in operational environments, reduced environmental noise, and reduced production and maintenance cost of technologies and systems related to primary propulsion and power systems for Army FTUAS. Knowledge of the current state of the art of candidate technologies and barriers to the fielding of these technologies on military UAS will be instrumental in supporting the need for future ventures performed through both the U.S. Government and contractors.</p>
<p>Preliminary engineering analysis has been exploratory in nature and conducted within the Aviation Development Directorate (ADD) to determine the potential technology offerings and achievable metrics in the horsepower range of 40 to 400 horsepower for primary propulsion and power systems for Army FTUAS. Current thoughts for technology development demonstrations under RASPS to support the future BCT TUAS and CAB TUAS vehicle classes are to pursue potential demonstrations at the lower end of this range (40-50 hp range) for application to potential future fixed wing and small vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) BCT TUAS and at the higher end of this range (200-400 hp demos) for potential application to larger VTOL BCT TUAS and smaller CAB TUAS. The Government may also choose to pursue demonstrations in only one of these size classes under the RASPS program due to funding limitations. Program metrics that are planned to be validated via design, analysis, and engine test during RASPS engine demonstration efforts are cruise specific fuel consumption (lb/hp*hr) @ 50% Power and 10,000 feet ISA, max power specific fuel consumption (lb/hp*hr) @ 100% Power and sea level STD, horsepower to weight ratio (hp/lb), reliability (Mean Time Between Essential Function Failure (MTBEFF) in hours), environmental noise, and production cost ($/hp). Note that an EFF is generally a failure/malfunction of the propulsion system resulting in unacceptable degradation or unacceptable loss of propulsion system power or RPMs. An EFF can be a component failure, the repair of which cannot be delayed until the next scheduled maintenance point. Also, note that all offerings must be inherently designed to run on heavy fuel. Note that for the horsepower to weight ratio metric, the weight must include all accessories/subcomponents (i.e., cooling systems, turbochargers, etc) required for self-sustaining operation across the operational envelope. Discussion of the offered engine configuration's ability to be designed to operate in both vertical and horizontal attitudes should be included, as this will be a desirable characteristic for some potential future UAS configurations.<br /><br />White papers that address the following items are requested:<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; Information on enabling reliable small power systems technologies that address the above metrics that are ready for design, development, and validation. <br />&bull; Information on the current state-of-the-art (including discussion of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status) of candidate power systems and associated key technologies. <br />&bull; Description of what development/S&amp;T efforts are currently funded and ongoing that relate to identified candidate technologies. Please provide the information on these efforts, to include the source of funding of these efforts, within a separate addendum.<br />&bull; Specific values of what it is believed the candidate technology can achieve relative to the above identified program metrics along with substantiation of these capabilities and information to help define goal values for these metrics for any or all of the engine size classes of interest.<br />&bull; Description of effort and rough order of magnitude (ROM) of projected cost to develop and demonstrate technologies of interest to a technology readiness level of 6 culminating in engine performance testing and the optional costs to complete a 150 hour endurance test, characterized by 14 CFR 33.49. At least one re-design, fabrication, and test iteration should be assumed to address shortfalls. Hardware requirements should include fabrication of three engine sets (to complete the above testing and to support additional test efforts below).<br />&bull; ROM of projected cost to perform technical support during 30 hours of altitude testing at the Army Research Laboratory's Small Engine Altitude Research Facility (SMEARF) to validate performance and re-light capability across the operational spectrum. Altitude test points of interest include:<br />o Sea level, Standard, at 50% and 100% power <br />o 10,000 ft ISA at 25%, 50% and 100% power <br />o 25,000 ft ISA at 25%, 50% and 100% power (this would be at 15,000 ft ISA for 50 hp engines and below) <br />o 6,000 ft, 95 F at 100% power <br />Or alternatively, provide ROM for engine installation and altitude testing in own/selected facilities along with discussion of reasoning / benefits of testing in contractor selected facilities. Note that ARL's SMEARF dyno max power is 250 hp.<br />&bull; ROM of projected cost to perform technical support during 500 hours of reliability testing at the Army facilities to investigate reliability characteristics of the engine technology. Or alternatively, provide ROM for engine installation and reliability testing in own/selected facilities along with discussion of reasoning / benefits of testing in contractor selected facilities.<br />&bull; ROM of projected cost to perform technical support during noise testing at the Government facilities to investigate environmental noise characteristics of the engine technology.<br />&bull; Discuss the scalability of the engine technologies from the current designed horsepower, and identify any technology that would be required to scale the engine up by 100% and down by 50% horsepower along with the ability to scale across the 40 to 400 hp range of interest. <br />&bull; Provide approximate volume (length x width x depth) of candidate propulsion systems to include all accessories/subcomponents (i.e., cooling systems, turbochargers, etc) required for self-sustaining operation across the operational envelope.</p>
<p>White papers submitted in response to this RFI should also include a cover letter with the following information: Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, CAGE code, NAICS code and size and type of ownership for the organization.</p>
<p>There is no intent on the part of the Government to provide feedback on white papers submitted in response to this RFI. However, ADD may contact the submitter for further information as necessary.</p>

Any deviation from the specifications of these products will increase risk to the patient and is unacceptable to the Government. Surgery dates: 22 Nov 16.

<SOLNBR>NEEG1100-16-00728
<RESPDATE>111116
<CONTACT>Edith Baz, Phone 206-526-6712, Email Edith.Baz@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT <br />This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), which maintains an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with The Aerospace Corporation, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), Office of Satellite Ground Services (OSGS) who has a requirement for unbiased, professional, non-personal services in space and ground systems engineering, and associated disciplines:
<p>&bull; in space and ground systems acquisitions and requirements analysis, including preparation of market research, cost analysis, contract strategy for acquisition activities including support to source selections.<br />&bull; in Space and ground system technical support for system engineering, risk assessment, radio frequency (RF) analysis, requirement verification, validation and testing.<br />&bull; in all activities associated with the launch and early orbit checkout of satellites under the operational purview of NOAA/NESDIS.<br />&bull; for the study, development, enhancement and sustainment of prototype systems including the Multi-Constellation User Terminal (MCUT) and a phased array antenna prototype.</p>
<p>Since 1995, NOAA has had a strategic partnership with The Aerospace Corporation utilizing the non-sponsor Aerospace FFRDC. The Aerospace Corporation is a data repository and national memory for space launch and satellite systems to support both long-term planning and the immediate needs of the nation's national security space program, from inception and definition; through design, architecture, and engineering; to launch, deployment, and data collection.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) establishes the continued need for the Aerospace FFRDC as no other known entity can perform this function. The ability to draw on research and development resources to solve complex and system level problems with extensive unequalled experience and access to a repository of data on both military and civilian space missions conveys Aerospace's strength. These advantageous qualifications allow Aerospace the power to make independent evaluations for NOAA that are not available from any other source and increases the probability of achieving mission success without comprising theirs and NOAA's integrity. Additionally, Aerospace has an extensive history it has developed over the past 45 years in providing highly technical, scientific, R&amp;D, and engineering services to space programs across NOAA, the USAF, Department of Defense, and intelligence, civil, commercial, and international communities. No federal employees are currently performing this work at the Program Office level.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be provided within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. local time, November 11, 2016. The responses must be submitted via e-mail to Edith Baz, Contract Specialist, at Edith.Baz@noaa.gov, with a hard copy to the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Satellite and Information Acquisition Division, 7600 Sand Point Way NE SOU6, Bldg 1, Seattle, WA 98115.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information from A and E Firms to Obtain Information to be Used in a Justification and Approval for Use Other Than Full and Open Competition Under the Authority of FAR 6.302-1
<SOLNBR>N6247017RFI01
<CONTACT>
<DESC>1.	This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is a market research tool being utilized in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.302-1 to obtain information to be used in a Justification and Approval for Use Other Than Full and Open Competition under the authority at FAR 6.302-1.   The information received will be used within Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic to facilitate the decision making process.

2.	This is a survey of the market potential.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research and is not restricted to a particular acquisition approach.
 No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. 

3.	NAVFAC Atlantic intends to issue an out of scope modification to the Architectural and Engineering (A and E) firm that recently completed the final design to build a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space located at NSA, Bahrain.  The revised final document was a full design that did not include RF Shielding.  RF Shielding is required in the design for certification; therefore, the design requires revision.  The out of scope modification would enable the A and E firm that completed the design for the building to add RF Shielding to the design.
   

NAVFAC Atlantic is requesting information on the capabilities of other A and E firms to add RF shielding to the existing design.  NAVFAC Atlantic anticipates that using a firm other than the firm that completed the existing design will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements.  

It is requested that A and E firms submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 4 pages single-sided, singled-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating the following: 

(1)	Capabilities of the A and E firm with specific information about past design work involving RF Shielding;
(2)	Estimate of the time and cost associated with analyzing another firms completed building design and adding RF shielding to that design; and,
(3)	Company profile to include DUNS number, CAGE Code, and statement regarding small business designation and status

The package shall be sent via email: amber.forehand@navy.mil

Package must be received no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 10 November 2016.
  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed to Amber Forehand-Hughes via electronic mail (email) at amber.forehand@navy.mil.

<p><br />ERDC-CRREL intends to procure ground support (in the form of installation services) and flight support for research mapping instrumentation. The primary aspect of this project is focused on capturing 3D topographic mapping data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors over United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) owned reservoirs across the western and southwestern United States (Oxnard, CA, Fresno, CA, and Phoenix, AZ) during the current low-storage state induced by drought. The contractor shall perform the following tasks and provide the necessary support:</p>
<p>a) Provide an Office of Aircraft Services (OAS)-certified Partenavia P-68C high-wing aircraft with the following: <br /><br />a. FAA approved camera port in the belly of the fuselage with mounting holes for attaching the custom RS/GIS CX Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) system to the aircraft.<br /><br />b. An external GPS antenna mounting location on the top of the fuselage in line with the wings for the installation of the ALS GPS antenna.<br /><br />c. Access to two 28VDC power supply connections from within the passenger/sensor compartment. Connections should be a mil-spec connector. Contractor to provide details of this connection to RS/GIS CX. The power supply connections should be checked prior to installation of the ALS system and be in good working order.<br /><br />d. Reconfiguration of aircraft seating to accommodate the ALS system and a maximum of two system operators.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Installation and removal of RS/GIS CX ALS system in aircraft, charged at a&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed&nbsp;hourly rate, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Custom modification to camera port mounting plate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Modification to GPS antenna mounting plate for fit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Configuration of power and communication cables inside the aircraft<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Setup of Flight Management System (FMS) hardware inside the aircraft<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) An OAS-certified pilot capable of following planned flight lines using the RS/GIS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CX Flight Management System's pilot's display.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Ensure the aircraft has scheduled maintenance (50-hrs and 100-hrs) completed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prior to the start of each data acquisition campaign.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide scheduled maintenance (50-hrs and 100-hrs) as needed during data<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acquisition campaigns.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Complete the collection of all listed focus areas in cooperation with RS/GIS CX<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel (ALS system operator and ground crew).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g) Fly data acquisition flight plans at specified above ground level (AGL) altitudes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and airspeeds, as required by RS/GIS CX.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h) Arrange for use of Fixed-base Operator (FBO) locations in desired locations, per<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flight plans specified by RS/GIS CX.</p>
<p>Aspen Helicopters, Inc was identified as the only vendor capable of offering services and equipment meeting the requisite specifications and interoperability requirements with CRREL's existing ALS system and uniquely-designed mounting equipment. This includes a refined sensor package crafted through previous research efforts between Aspen Helicopters, CRREL, and USGS. Full interoperability is required to allow the system to take accurate LiDAR measurements and function seamlessly while deployed. As such, installing CRREL's specialized equipment on another aircraft is not feasible and would result in loss of functionality.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541360, which has a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC><br />Cabrillo National Monument encompasses a stunning landscape and viewshed on the Point Loma peninsula at the entrance to San Diego Bay. Relatively, the park is small (160 acres), and the park experience simply designed and comprehensible. However, considerable topography makes navigating the park a bit more complex, and good signage, particularly wayfinding, is a necessity.
<p>The purpose of this order is to provide the fabrication and installation (as applicable) of signs for Cabrillo National Monument, San Diego, California.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #2:<br /></span></strong><br />Kenya - Gitaru 10 Megawatt Solar Power Plant Feasibility Study <br />(Solicitation Number: 2016-11019A)<br />https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=a9008d79631c75d89ef2e519f169282d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0
<p>Q1: Can you provide clarification on the host country content percentage? Are offeror's able to increase the local (host country) labor to perform Feasibility Study beyond the 20 percent limit indicated in the RFP?</p>
<p>A1: No more than 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount (USD $998,000) may be used to pay for services performed by (i) host country subcontractors, and/or (ii) host country nationals who are employees of the contractor (offeror). Refer to the RFP Annex III (USTDA Nationality, Source and Origin Requirements) for the full details. All offers must comply with the USTDA Nationality, Source and Origin Requirements to be eligible for consideration.</p>
<p>Q2: If a firm is selected to perform the Feasibility Study for the KenGen Gitaru Solar Project would they be precluded from participation in follow-on development or implementation work for the Project?</p>
<p>A2: As long as the completed Feasibility Study is availed to all the other bidders for engineering supervision works ("project implementation"), then the consultant (offeror) selected to perform the USTDA-funded Feasibility Study would not be precluded from participating in the downstream works for the Project.</p>
<p>Q3: Will KenGen's 10 MW Gitaru Solar Project be mounted on a roof or on land? Will the Project be implemented as one plant at a single site or as multiple sites/installations?</p>
<p>A3: The solar panels would be installed on land and would comprise one power plant sized at 10 MW.</p>
<p>Q4: Can you clarify the term "U.S. Subcontractor" especially in relation to the potential participation of a U.S. Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) such as a U.S. national laboratory as a subcontractor.  Can a U.S. national laboratory be included as a U.S. subcontractor on the team so long as they satisfy all U.S. origin, source, and nationality requirements?</p>
<p>A4: Refer to full definitions and requirements in the RFP Annex III (USTDA Nationality, Source and Origin Requirements). As defined in Annex III, for purposes of the USTDA funded activity, a "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm that is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. citizens and/or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. A partnership that is organized in the U.S., has its principal place of business in the U.S., and is more than 50% owned by U.S. citizens and/or permanent residents, qualifies as a "U.S. firm". A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association, also qualifies as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the U.S. and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. citizens and/or permanent residents.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched The Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in November of 2007, and subsequently expanded the program into priority areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in September of 2009, and Sindh and Punjab in October of 2011.</p>
<p>The PTI program supports the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) development efforts to better integrate FATA/KP into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. PTI also supports the GOP in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region's most immediate needs, which requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities in the region. In Sindh and Punjab, PTI works to counter violent extremism in order to build a foundation for political and social development in conflict-prone communities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative post is a middle-management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. The incumbent should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantees and contractor/USAID relationships. The Deputy Country Representative must communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming, including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Administrative Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other related duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Pakistan, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Pakistan, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, freedom of movement restrictions can vary greatly depending on the assigned location in-country. The position will likely require travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battlefield Airmen Branch (BA) is soliciting information to identify sources to provide Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD), production, and sustainment capabilities for Dismounted VDL systems. The Dismounted VDL program was approved to enhance dismounted system capability and to address loss of spectrum, due to spectrum auction. Bandwidths 1695-1710 and 1755-1780MHz were auctioned in L-Band, and bandwidths 2025-2110MHz were expanded in the lower portion of S-Band.</p>
<p>VDL capability improves Intelligence, Surveillance, &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) essential to close air support, Command &amp; Control (C2), air superiority, target identification, and situational awareness (SA). The Dismounted VDL system's overall concept is to receive, transmit, and display secure and unsecure FMV and annotated images to and from C2 nodes (Dismounted, Mounted, Airborne) via a small, lightweight, ruggedized, and reliable receiver or transceiver. The system will be operator-carried for long durations on limited battery power in a full spectrum of environmental and combat conditions.</p>
<p>Minimum Dismounted VDL Requirements</p>
<p>This system is required to possess Type 1 encryption capability through the use of NSA cryptocore modernization (CCM) and Government approved AES encryption. The Government desires this system to be depot-level repairable. The system must be interoperable with 466ER, Tactical, VNW, FM analog, DDL, STD-CDL and BE-CDL waveforms. The system must support UHF, L-Band, S-Band, C-Band, and KU-Band and support new S-Band frequencies of 2025 to 2110 MHz. The system must be water-resistant and ruggedized. The government anticipates allocating 10 to 15 million dollars to this effort or efforts.</p>
<p>The government is interested in evolutionary increases in capability, as well as reductions in Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). This may culminate in multiple development efforts and contracts; both for an advanced capability device, as well as for a very low SWaP, receive-only device.</p>
<p>1. In addition to meeting the above requirements, provide a technology development roadmap for Dismounted VDL, for receive-only and transceiver systems, for the next 5 years. <br />2. The system requirements for the transceiver may require networking capability in either a mesh or hub-spoke structure.<br />3. Identify other peripherals envisioned to be necessary to utilize your system?<br />4. Identify GPS capability you can provide within the stated timeline?<br />5. Describe the user interface of any proposed system, including the Web-based graphical user interface, if applicable.<br />6. What improvements in SWaP can you achieve in this timeline, and how?</p>
<p>Sustainment</p>
<p>1. Describe your training concept.<br />2. What is the maintenance concept to include software updates?<br />3. What built-in test/diagnostic capabilities do you envision? <br />4. Describe your approach for repair and diagnostic capabilities of the system.</p>
<p>System Quality</p>
<p>1. What mean time between failure (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) have you achieved in previous similar products?</p>
<p>Capabilities Package<br />The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The package shall include the following information and address the questions below:</p>
<p>Company/Institute Name: <br />Address: <br />Point of Contact (to include phone number and email address) : <br />CAGE Code: <br />Web Page URL: <br />Size of business pursuant to NAICS Code Insert 6 digit code and title here, size standard Insert size standard here.

(b) Applicability. This clause applies only to--
(1) Contracts that have been totally set aside or reserved for small business concerns; and
(2) Orders set aside for small business concerns under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).*

This paragraph does not apply to construction or service contracts.

2.  Description of the Required Services
Navigation Technical Assistance Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet the needs of the 21st Century.  Inherent in this mission is the requirement to provide a safe, cost-effective, navigation and timing service. Currently, navigation requirements are largely met with legacy, ground-based navigation, and lighting systems.  FAA has committed to evolving the NAS to Performance Based Navigation (AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP).  During this lengthy transition, FAA has a requirement to support both legacy and modernized navigation systems.  

Through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), FAA is addressing the impact of air traffic growth by increasing capacity and efficiency while improving safety, reducing environmental impacts, and increasing user access to the National Airspace System (NAS).  AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP is an essential element of the NextGen plan to modernize the NAS.  To achieve NextGen goals, FAA is implementing new AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP routes and procedures that leverage emerging space-based technologies and enhanced aircraft navigation capabilities.  

The NAVTAC II support Contractor will assist the Navigation Programs Group and Performance Based Navigation Offices in their joint mission to provide safe, cost-effective position, navigation, and timing services to meet the operational needs of current and future aviation customers that operate in the NAS.   The FAA Navigation Programs Group and the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Office have a need for professional services covering areas such as engineering support, logistics, software integration and maintenance, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, and business and material management. Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing, and lighting systems, as well as support for the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Instrument Flight Procedure (IFP) process. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  All enclosed SIR Sections are final.  Please read and the review the SIR documents thoroughly.

5.  All questions should be addressed as directed and specified in Section L .4.7 of the SIR.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0001 is to extend the Request for Information (RFI) closing date from October 31, 2016 to November 3, 2016.  This action is necessitated as a result of inquiries received from industry against the initial positing dated September 16, 2016.   The Government responses to questions received from industry are provided in the enclosed attachment.  Please review the enclosed attachment which can be downloaded from the following URL:  http://faaco.faa.gov/. All other information remains unchanged.  

End of Amendment 0001

---------------------------------------------------------------



This Market Survey/Request for Information is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.

1.	Introduction and Purpose

The FAAs Air Traffic Organization (ATO) mission is to provide safe, secure, and efficient air traffic separation services to commercial, private, and military customers operating in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is soliciting interest from industry participants capable of providing and installing Internet Protocol (IP) based Air Traffic Control (ATC) voice switches at facilities supporting terminal and Alaska Flight Service operations.

The ATC voice switch is a mission-critical part of the communications infrastructure that supports every domain of ATC within the NAS.  Voice switches provide a configurable, flexible and user-selectable combination of air-to-ground (A/G) and ground-to-ground (G/G) voice communications to allow conversations between controllers, pilots (via radio link) and other ground-based facilities.

2.	Desired Attributes
 
The FAA is soliciting information about the current market place availability of a network-based Voice Communications System (VCS) in the small terminal environment with the following high-priority attributes.  

	Cost effective replacement of existing analog based switch
	Requires little or no development prior to use in an ATC environment
	High reliability with redundancy options also available
	Low supportability costs
	Low risk of not being able to enter and pass formal testing (without significant development)
	ED-137 compliance
	Allows integration into a flexible communications routing network that supports features such as A/G asset sharing

Physical space may be limited in the smaller facilities.  The FAA would like the vendors to respond with this space limitation and the above attributes in mind.

Please review and respond to Attachment 1 titled Small IP Terminal Voice Switch Request for Information (RFI) # 1 Survey Questions.  The results of this RFI will be used by the FAA to gather information and understand the state of commercially-available IP-based VCSs suitable for use in an ATC terminal environment and as input to future FAA VCS strategies.  

3.	Nature of Request

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only, and the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain pertinent information in regards to potential ATC VCS solutions.

This RFI does not create a promise to award a contract; the Government will not provide compensation associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this RFI.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the FAA.  The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey.  Responses will not be returned.  Respondents may not be notified of the results of this survey or of information submitted.  The FAA may elect to meet with one or more of the RFI respondents independently to ask additional questions.  The FAA will use the information as input in determining potential future VCS strategies.
  
4.	Submittal Requirements

Please provide responses to the questions contained in Attachment 1.  Responses are due no later than 2:00pm EDT, October 31, 2016 and must be submitted in softcopy via email to the Contracting Officer, Dana D. Brooks, at dana.d.brooks@faa.gov.  All responses must be provided in the English language.  It is the contractors responsibility to appropriately mark any proprietary information.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government is proposing a hardware development approach that involves Engineering Demonstration Model (EDM), Proof of Design (POD), and Proof of Manufacture (POM) deliverables prior to entering Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). For EDMs, the only required deliverable is a Guidance and Control Box (GCB), which will support early Government bench-top testing and Operational Software (OPSW) integration with the Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Software Test Bed (AST). This GCB EDM can be a functionally equivalent unit and although desirable, does not need to meet all form and fit requirements (i.e., a functioning rack mount system would be acceptable).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the POD and POM deliverables, complete G&amp;C Sections, TI-1 Warhead Electronics System (WES) Kits, and Improved Post Launch Communications (IPLCS) Kits will be required which meet all form, fit and functional requirements. Approval to proceed with EDM development will be predicated on an approved System Functional Review (SFR) baseline, approval to proceed with POD development will be predicated on an approved Preliminary Design Review (PDR) baseline, and approval to proceed with POM development will be predicated on an approved Critical Design Review (CDR) baseline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">It is anticipated that 3-4 years of DT/OT testing with POD, POM &amp; LRIP hardware will be required in order to meet current Initial Operation Capability (IOC) requirement of FY24.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to meet current testing objectives, EDM deliveries are required to begin 7 months after contract award, POD deliveries are required to begin 22 months after contract award, and POM deliveries are required 16 months after initial POD deliveries (38 months after contract award).</span></p>

Prospective Contractors can propose any array architecture / element count up to 560 which meets all performance requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, an array consisting of more than 128 elements will require upgrades to the existing Government infrastructure and will ultimately cause the Government to incur additional costs for upgrading impacted equipment. Accordingly, when evaluating Contractor proposals that specify element counts greater than 128, the Government may take into consideration additional Government Total Ownership Costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Criteria for evaluating such costs would be specified in any Request for Proposals resulting from this RFI.</span></p>

<DESC>CHIGNIK HARBOR BREAKWATER REPAIRS, CHIGNIK, ALASKA
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this project lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the Government from other sources.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The project is to perform repairs on the existing north and south breakwaters at Chignik Harbor which are 304 feet and 1,279 feet in length, respectively. Repairs will be made by placing additional armor stone on the breakwaters. Approximately 40% of the existing armor stone is deteriorating and disintegrating due to poor quality of the original rock. The majority of the deterioration is on seaward side of breakwaters and the repair plan is to selectively replace damaged or missing armor stones with new armor stones of higher durability. There will be no demolition or removal of existing armor stone. Due to the condition of the existing armor stone, it is anticipated that equipment will not be permitted on the breakwaters and that rock placement will be from marine-based equipment. There is no government furnished or designated rock source for this project. The existing rock was produced at a local quarry however due to the poor quality of the existing rock, it is not anticipated that the local quarry, if operational, will be approved for use on this project.</p>
<p>Average weight of the new armor stone is anticipated to be approximately 4,500 pounds per stone. The Government anticipates awarding a contract with an initial scope requiring placement of an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 tons of armor stone and two options to each place a similar additional quantity of armor stone.</p>

<CONTACT>Robert R Hilton , Phone 2156566911, Email robert.r.hilton@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Philadelphia District intends to initiate a Request For Proposals and award a single Firm-Fixed Price contract for the construction of a new Type III Hydrant Fuel System at Dover AFB, Delaware. The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government intends to award using the Best Value Tradeoff Process to one responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government.
<p>There will be a pre-proposal site visit to allow prospective offerors access to the site. The date and time is to be determined; offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed during this one escorted site visit the Government will host. Note: The solicitation and subsequent contract will include FAR 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work. All interested offerors will be expected to contact Joseph Durkin via email at Joseph.A.Durkin@usace.army.mil within 5 calendar days after the solicitation has been posted. Each offeror will be restricted to two attendees; provide the following information in the email: name, company name, email, and phone number.</p>
<p>This requirement is to construct a new Type III Hydrant Fuel System on the east side of the Dover AFB airfield to fuel aircraft parked on the hazardous cargo apron at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The work consists of, but is not limited to, construction of a new pump house with controls room, two 5,000 barrel storage tanks, and an underground delivery system to three fuel hydrants. The underground delivery system includes fuel filters/separators, a product recovery system, underground stainless steel receipt and hydrant loop piping, cathodic protection, isolation valves, and leak detection system. Also included in the work are cutting and filling to achieve site grades, AT/FP measures, fire control, utilities, pavements, storm water management, soil contamination, communications support, and incidental related work.</p>
<p>Existing site conditions include existing fill materials and moisture sensitive soils consisting of silts and clays. Consequently, prudent earthwork techniques must be utilized to facilitate fill placement and compaction activities. The soil appears to be uncontaminated based on testing but it should be considered that there is always the potential to encounter contaminated soil.</p>
<p>The contract duration will be a total of&nbsp;730 calendar days from Notice to Proceed for all work and services. The contract will contain Liquidated Damages, for failure to complete the work within the designated performance period, the daily rate will be published in the solicitation. Notice to proceed shall be contingent upon successful submission of Payment and Performance Bonds.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a single responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the terms and conditions of the solicitation represents the overall best value to the Government after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub factors in the solicitation without discussions. The offeror's initial proposal should therefore contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Proposals will be evaluated against the following factors and subfactors (both listed in descending order of importance) as listed in the solicitation: Factor 1 - Relevant Construction Contractor Experience, Factor 2 - Subcontractor Utilization Plan, Subfactors: Proposed Subcontractor's Qualifications, Construction Experience, and Management, Factor 3 - Technical Approach - Subfactors: Key Personnel, and Teaming, and Factor 4 - Past Performance, Construction. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than Price; however, Price will remain a significant factor and will increase in significance in the selection decision the closer two proposals are in rating and ranking.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number W912BU-16-R-0037 will be issued on or about&nbsp;September 2, 2016, with a proposal due date of about&nbsp;November 15, 2016 at 4:00 p.m.EST. The estimated order of magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000.00 and $25,000,000.00. The NAICS Code for this project is 237120 and the small business size standard is $36.5 million. Davis Bacon rates will be applicable to the contract. Performance and Payment bonds will be required for 100% of contract award. Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/. Registration for plans and specifications should be made via the FBO internet homepage. Hard copies will not be available. No written or fax requests will be accepted. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor FBO for any amendments.</p>
<p>Contractors who receive a federal contract of $25,000.00 are required by legislation (FAR 22.1310(b)) to submit an annual VETS-100 Report on your employment of targeted veterans. Information on submitting your report may be obtained by calling 1-866-237-0275 or by accessing the following internet website: http://www.dol.gov/vets/vets-100.html. All contractors must be registered in the DODs System for Award Management database at www.sam.gov (formerly Central Contractor Registration) as required by DFARS 204.1103. Affirmative Action to ensure equal opportunity is applicable to the resulting contract.</p>

The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it.

The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.</p>
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, SFC Kenetta Meares, by e-mail Kenetta.a.meares@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p>The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 25 March 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS</p>

<DESC>The ultimate goal of the "Speaking Truth to Nonproliferation" project is to identify the current obstacles to earlier and closer cooperation between nuclear nonproliferation intelligence and policy making officials to avoid bad futures well before they become inevitable. In a number of cases our intelligence was clear enough but there was a reluctance to ruffle the diplomatic waters unless absolutely necessary, or to risk other aspects of an international relationship, with the result that the window for effective U.S. action closed. What then happens is that, in the case of friendly states, we rationalize that there is nothing much we can do and default to a general acquiescence in things-as-they-are. In the case of unfriendly states-North Korea, Iran, Syria-the discussion turns quickly to military action. NPEC believes there is much to be learned from a detailed historical analysis about avoiding the either-or of acquiescence or resort to military action.

<DESC>Under this requirement, the contractor will deliver a prototype system for use in the evaluation of a long-standoff subsurface and above surface target detection system in the maritime environment. The prototype system will consist of two maritime network nodes; LRI Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARC) SV3 Unmanned Surface Vehicles (wave gliders) equipped with a sensor payload system to demonstrate the target detection concept. The program will leverage ongoing industry developments in acoustic sensing from the Liquid Robotics, Inc. (LRI) SHARC SV3. At-sea testing events will be conducted to exercise the system's sensing capability and to collect data in support of initial concept validation. The overall goal of the system is to provide a first step towards an early warning capability which could direct attention to a specific or refined area /region.
