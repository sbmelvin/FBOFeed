<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to issue a solicitation for RTC Wide Support Services (RWSS) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. It will be set-aside for 8(a) Small Businesses under NAICS 541712 (exception for space vehicles and guided missiles). The resulting contract is expected to be a five year (one year Base Period, four one-year Option Periods) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).<br /><br />Redstone Test Center (RTC) provides technical support to the local aviation and weapon systems acquisition community, the US Army, and other customers (Department of Defense (DOD), private industry, Joint Services, and foreign governments) for aviation and weapon system research, development, production, and post-deployment testing activities. These efforts are conducted primarily at Redstone Arsenal, but test and evaluation support is also provided at other Continental United States (CONUS) and outside CONUS (OCONUS) sites on a temporary duty basis. Contractor support is necessary due to the limited number of Government personnel available to meet test and evaluation demands. This action is to consolidate support services in all of the Directorates and Divisions in executing RTC's mission. RTC Directorates and Divisions require contractor support to provide labor and supplies, equipment, test fixtures, tools, materials, and transportation necessary to perform tests, evaluations, analyses, incidental support required to support activities for testing efforts, and other associated activities.
<p>There is no solicitation available at this time. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is planned for release before the end of January 2016. A formal solicitation release is planned for the beginning of May 2016.<br />The official release of the solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov/. The on-line version of the RFP will include all documents of the solicitation package. No hard copy of the solicitation will be issued. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the solicitation. The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response. It is the responsibility of those responding to the solicitation to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. Dominic E. J. Milligan is the POC for this action; dominic.e.jenkins-milligan.civ@mail.mil<br /><br />It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO website on a regular basis for any updates. Other documents, as necessary, will be posted when available.</p>

The date is to be determined and will be posted to the FBO at a later date.<br /><br />The following are the instructions to a potential Offeror on how to access a secure document: <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Secure Documents</span><br /><br />Several documents related to this solicitation will be posted as "secured" in the FedBizOpps website.&nbsp;Please find below instructions to access secured documents in FedBizOpps.<br /><br />Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site:<br /><br />To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system, offerors must:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).&nbsp; Please note that SAM has replaced the previous system Central Contractor Registration (CCR).&nbsp; If an entity was previously registered in CRR the information should have transferred into SAM.&nbsp; You just need to set up a SAM account and migrate your CCR roles.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in.&nbsp; Verify your registration within the FBO system.&nbsp; The FBO Vendor Guide is available at <br />https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf<br />&lt;https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to provide assistance.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf</a><br />&lt;http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf&gt;- .&nbsp; Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on&nbsp;the form.&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt.&nbsp;Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.&nbsp;Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system.&nbsp;Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation and Training Division (L-3) for the development and delivery of the L3 specific sensor models (e.g. - APG-73 RADAR, and Electro-optical Infrared (EO/IR) to TOFT 125, located at the Integrated Battlespace Arena (IBAR) at NAWS China Lake, CA; and for the development and delivery of  upgrades to communications (COMMS), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), and Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) capability to all F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFTs).
  As the current designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer, and supplier of a substantial share of the F/A-18 C-G TOFT hardware and software components, L-3 is the only company capable of delivering the current US Navy F/A-18E/F and EA-18G TOFT COMMS, MIDS, FST, and sensor models upgrades in the appropriate timeframe to meet these requirements.  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.

This is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with L3. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.
 Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain FA-18 and EA-18G aircraft elements and simulation technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Alyssa Ocasio (Alyssa.Ocasio@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 19 Feb 2016. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages.
 A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the Contract for the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G TOFT NASMP NSF-1 will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C.(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).
 Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Alyssa Ocasio at 407-380-4034 or via email at Alyssa.Ocasio@navy.mil.

<DESC>The work includes, but is not limited to, providing towing and recovery services for various types of Government-owned vehicles and equipment weighing 110,000 pounds (GVWR) or less.  Services also include electrical jump starts and unlocking vehicles.  Recovery service of vehicles includes re-locating vehicles from soft sand, ditches, inclines, off road areas, etc. to an area where the vehicle can be properly and safely hooked up for normal towing. Up-righting vehicles is also included.  Procurement Method: Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 488410 and the annual size standard is $7,500,000.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.
 The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months. The Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.  Work will be issued via the DOD EMALL, a web-based ordering system, using Government purchase cards.  Only the base period of the contract will offer a minimum guarantee.  This is a new procurement.  It does not replace an existing contract.  No prior contract information exists.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available. All interested offerors shall register at the website.  No notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors.  A sources sought notice was issued on November 16, 2015.
  Only one response was received from a small business.  Since we do not have a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns, we will issue the subject solicitation as unrestricted. The NAVAC Hawaii small business office concurs with the set-aside determination.  Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a non-price proposal, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposal receipt date is approximate.

<RESPDATE>063015
<CONTACT>Tino Philip, 5406653953

<a href="mailto:tino.philip@usace.army.mil">USACE Middle East District</a>
<DESC> <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) Middle East District intends to solicit names of construction firms experienced in working in the Middle East region who are interested in submitting a firm-fixed price offer for this project. <br>  <br> Note: The Project name Breakwater and Ammunition Pier Repair has changed to Breakwater and Cargo Pier Repair.  <br>  <br> PROJECT SCOPE: This project scope includes the following elements: <br>  <br> Repair of the south breakwater and cargo pier at Kuwait Naval Base (KNB). KNB was originally constructed in the late 1970's and over the last 35 years the superstructure of the south breakwater and the cargo pier, which is accessed from the breakwater has fallen into disrepair.  <br>  <br> There is significant cracking and various types of damage to the concrete superstructure of the breakwater. The breakwater is approximately 1.0 kilometers in length and creates an artificial harbor for the portside operations of KNB. The breakwater supports a roadway allowing traffic to the head of the breakwater, as well as various utilities (including fuel, water, fire water, communications, and electrical service). The scope of this project includes the replacement of the ocean side vertical wall for the length of the breakwater, the replacement of the harbor side walls along the raised head sections, replacement of the road pavement sections on the raised head sections of the breakwater, the repair and resurfacing of the concrete deck along trunk sections of the breakwater, repair/resurfacing of the harbor side wall on the trunk sections, roadway resurfacing for the length of the breakwater, various aesthetic improvements to all parts of the breakwater, replacement of ocean side sidewalks, repair of an indicated number of ocean side foundation blocks, and the replacement of all utility lines. The scope also includes the repair or replacement of safety railings, access ladders, anchor bollards, mooring cleats, water filling stations, fueling points, fire suppression connections points, light poles, flag poles, guard rails, an 110kV transformer, electrical distribution panels, shelters, and navigational lighting.  <br>  <br> The cargo pier is approximately 1875 square meters in size, with two access bridges to the roadway on the breakwater, and is used for cargo loading and off-loading operations. The scope of the project includes the removal and replacement of the entire pier concrete decking, the access bridges, the concrete pile caps supporting the bridges, and all features of the cargo pier located on top of the bridge and deck. The existing support piles are sound, and may remain. The fender system is structurally independent of the pier deck, and may also remain with the exception of the northern end (which has been irreparably damaged) and the wooden bumpers bolted to the vessel side of the fender.  <br>  <br> Prior to construction beginning on the cargo pier, an alternative cargo pier must be constructed so that periodic cargo off-load operations can continue during construction. This pier should be considered a permanent feature which will remain after completion of construction. <br>  <br> The anticipated period of performance is 640 calendar days for the Project. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded to a prime construction contractor. The magnitude of the project is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.   <br>  <br> LOCATION: This project is located at the Kuwait Naval Base (KNB), Kuwait.  <br>  <br> PROPOSAL PERIOD: Two-Phase Design-Build Solicitation is scheduled for release on or about 01 July 2015. The Phase One proposals will be due on or about 30 July 2015.  The Phase Two will be issued on or about 15 September 2015 and proposals will be due on or about 04 November 2015.Contract award is scheduled on or about 18 January 2016.  <br>  <br> SET ASIDES and CODES: As the work will be performed outside of the continental United States, no set asides to small business or socioeconomic preference for this solicitation. This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System Code: 237990  quote mark Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction quote mark . <br>  <br> PROPOSAL PROCEDURES: This is a Two Phase Design-Build (D/B) solicitation process. In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.303-1, Phase One of the Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedure, offerors will be required to submit Construction Experience (Factor 1), Past Performance (Factor 2) information on relevant projects, and Technical Approach (Factor 3) to be described in the Request for Qualification (RFQ). Price proposals are not to be submitted under Phase One. No more than the top five (5) proposals will be selected to proceed to Phase Two of the evaluation process.  <br>  <br> For Phase Two of the Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedure, offerors will be required to submit their Design Experience (Factor 1), Project Design and Construction (Factor 2), and Price (Factor 3). Evaluation criteria will be stated in the Request for Proposal. The Government may include options in the Solicitation.

In the realization and distribution of UTC (NIST), the Time and Frequency Division maintains the US primary frequency standard, the time scale directly providing UTC (NIST), and the time and frequency transfer operations for the NIST contribution to global coordination of UTC through the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in France.</p>
<p>The primary frequency standard is currently the NIST-F1 cesium fountain atomic standard, with the next generation standard, NIST-F2, currently under testing for deployment in the near future. The time scale includes an ensemble of several hydrogen masers and cesium beam standards regularly calibrated for absolute frequency and frequency drift through NIST-F1 (and NIST-F2 in the near future). UTC (NIST) and standard frequency information are disseminated through two-way satellite time and frequency transfer and GPS common-view time transfer for global coordination of UTC and for direct service to customers requiring precision time and frequency measurements. NIST distributes UTC (NIST) and frequency information through many other means, including low frequency and ultrahigh frequency time code radio broadcasts, Internet time service, network time distribution, and other means.</p>
<p>In addition to realization and distribution of UTC (NIST) and standard frequency information, NIST conducts a vigorous program of research and development to improve the realization and distribution of UTC (NIST) and standard frequencies for evolving future applications.</p>
<p>The broad range of crucial impacts for UTC (NIST) and standard NIST frequencies on commercial, government, legal and international applications makes it imperative that NIST remain closely connected to current and future users and stakeholders for commercial, government, legal and international applications of precision timing and related quantities. These close connections ensure that NIST is providing the required support for existing applications, and that NIST is appropriately preparing for future needs and applications.</p>
<p>The current requirement may be summarized as follows to obtain contractor services to:</p>
<p>1) Work closely with the NIST Time and Frequency Division to represent NIST interests in timing and related quantities to key stakeholders and customers for commercial, government, legal and international time and frequency applications.<br />2) Engage these key customers and stakeholders to gather information and develop recommendations to NIST ensuring that NIST is most effectively meeting existing stakeholders needs and best prepared to meet future needs.<br />3) Visit time and frequency research and metrology programs across the US and across the world to evaluate current capabilities and future plans to compare with NIST capabilities and plans.<br />4) Develop analyses and informed recommendations regarding the current effectiveness and future possibilities for NIST time and frequency measurement, distribution and research programs that most effectively engage current and future stakeholders and customers.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements: The contractor shall successfully work with a broad range of stakeholders and customers in commerce, government, the international timing community, legal fields, and other areas where precision time and frequency is required. The contractor shall also successfully work with leading NIST scientists and metrologists to understand current measurement and research programs and the potential for future programs. The contractor shall develop expert analyses and recommendations based on input from a broad range of external customers, stakeholders, and input from leading NIST scientists and metrologists. To successfully fulfill these requirements, the contractor must possess broad and deep knowledge of atomic time and frequency standards, atomic time scales, precision satellite-mediated time and frequency transfer, international time and frequency coordination, and applications of precision time and frequency measurements for commercial, government, legal and international applications. The contractor must have demonstrated experience in all these areas. Futhermore, the contractor shall qualify and maintain eligibility for a TS/SCI level Security Clearance throughout the performance of the contract. <br />This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify organizations with the requisite qualifications to meet the requirements of the services stated herein. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and compared with NIST's minimum (see Requirements above), NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 541712. The specific purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to determine if there are small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that are capable of providing the services identified.</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they are capable of meeting these services should submit electronic copies or mailed copies of their capability statement. Please limit responses to ten (10) pages or less. Responses should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of company that will provide the services.<br />2. Contain sufficient detail to demonstrate experience and qualifications to meet the requirements.<br />3. Approach to complete the work<br />4. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum requirements and finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be so marked. The written capability statement should be received by the Contract Specialist no later than 2 p.m. MST Tuesday, 26, 2016. The capability statement shall identify the business status of the organization.</p>
<p>Only electronic or mailed statements will be accepted. Faxes will not be accepted. Send to Angela Hitt, Contract Specialist, at angela.hitt@nist.gov. Direct all questions to this e-mail.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information for Commercially Available Solutions for Information and Track Sharing between U.S. Coast Guard Cutters and Over-The Horizon Cutter Small Boats<br />HSCG44-16-R-RFI0004
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This posting is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested vendors and is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. This posting is not a Request for Proposals or a Request for Quotations, and it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor is the Government responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing information provided under this RFI. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI or Government use of any information provided. Further, the Coast Guard is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response to this RFI. The Government reserves the right to use any information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate, including using technical information provided by respondents in any resultant solicitation. Responses will assist the Government in determining the availability of potential solutions and commercial products in the market. At this time no solicitation exists; therefore, Do Not Request a Copy of the Solicitation. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement: The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Command, Control, and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN) requests information on a commercially viable solution to transmit Over-The-Horizon and track sharing information between the USCG Cutters and the Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Cutter Small Boats. The USCG is exploring ways in which to transmit navigation tracks, text messages, and search patterns from the SeaWatch system to the OTH Cutter Small Boats.</p>
<p>SeaWatch is a USCG system that provides an enhanced afloat Coast Guard System that integrates navigation and tactical sensors, communications and optical surveillance systems to provide a superior situational awareness of the operational environment at sea. The SeaWatch system interfaces with an array of shipboard sensors (Navigation, surface-search, air-search, multi-modal radio, etc.) that are a blend of Commercial products and Government software to provide the user with a consolidated Navigation, Radar and Continuity of Operations Picture.</p>
<p>The USCG's current capability for communications between the U.S. Coast Guard Cutters and the OTH Cutter Small Boats when deployed are limited to only voice communications via MICOM-3T HF Radio Transceivers and Rockwell Collins DVP-200s. The USCG is requesting information for a commercial solution that would use hand held equipment that could be easily carried on and off the OTH Cutter Small Boats. The USCG is looking to increase from the current voice only communications to a near real time Over-The-Horizon and tracking information communications from the USCG Cutters to the OTH Cutter Small Boats.</p>
<p>The proposed OTH Cutter Small Boat display solution would include a hand held portable device that does not require hard mounting on the OTH Cutter Small Boats, but could require software/hardware onboard the USCG Cutters. The hand held portable device would provide touch screen interaction.</p>
<p>The USCG is looking for the following capabilities.</p>
<p>1. Interface with the radio system via RS232.<br />2. Communicate in accordance with NMEA 0183/2000<br />3. Have the ability to encrypt transmissions at a minimum of 128 bit AES, and operate using open data formats (e.g. JSON, XML, etc.). <br />4. Allow interfacing with the existing circuit equipment MICOM-3T HF Radio Transceiver and Rockwell Collins DVP-200 as the means of communication.<br />5. The OTH Cutter Small Boat display would interface with existing OTH Cutter Small Boat navigation system.</p>
<p>Submission of Information: Interested parties are encouraged to submit a response which supports the company's claim that it presently has a commercial solution that provides the technology, performance, and functionality required to satisfy the requirements or submit a response which identifies areas in the system requirements your company can not meet. The Coast Guard's requirement may be refined based on knowledge gained from RFI submissions. Specifically, any interested parties are requested to provide the following information: <br />1. Name of Company and DUNS number <br />2. Point of contact and phone number <br />3. Size of Business according to North American Industry Classification System <br />(NAICS) Code 334220. <br />4. Positive statement of your interest in this procurement as a prime contractor<br />5. Description of your product that might fill this requirement: <br />a. What type of products do you offer that might fill this requirement? <br />b. Provide a description of your product's system capabilities and performance, environmental specifications, physical dimensions, power requirements, and remote communications capabilities. <br />c. Also include information regarding scalability of the system for use on fixed and rotary aircraft platforms. <br />d. Provide information on your product's capability to manage classified information.<br />e. Provide information how your product is suitable for a maritime environment which may include exposure to salt spray, salt fog, high humidity, shock and vibration.<br />f. Do you offer these products commercially? (Is this item under a current GSA Schedule or do you currently have a contract for this product/service with any other Federal Agency?)<br />g. Do you offer a commercial product that could be modified to fulfill this need?<br />h. Do you believe there is a better method of fulfilling this requirement? If so, provide an alternative solution.<br />i. Do you offer quantity or other discounts to your customers?<br />j. Do you have licensing requirements?<br />k. What are your warranty terms, if any? <br />l. Provide information for any additional charges for special packaging and marking?<br />m. Do you have a commercial catalog for a related group of products or services?<br />n. What is your average delivery lead time for this type of product?<br />o. Do you provide operation and maintenance manuals?<br />p. Provide a list of any proprietary data/components or embedded components for this product or data associated with this item?<br />q. Existing technical documentation and brochures are welcome as attachments as well as product catalogs and price lists. <br />r. Provide information on prior Government and commercial purchases of the same type (pricing, performance, and customer satisfaction data)<br />s. Provide description of any built in test feature, a flow chart of the system analysis, and a list of the circuit card or assembly level bit resolution.<br />t. What is your operational life cycle?<br />u. What is your repairable life cycle?</p>
<p>Comments/questions/concerns are encouraged and should be sent in writing to the Contract Specialist, Katherine Kearney at Katherine.M.Kearney@uscg.mil. Upon receiving feedback, the Coast Guard will assess all input and its impact on the development of the final specifications. Contractors doing business with the Government are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database before they can be awarded a contract. A template containing the information for registration can be found at: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/</p>
<p>Responses must be no longer than fifteen pages in length. Technical documentation, brochures, if included, do not count in the fifteen page maximum. Submit your response by 2:00 PM EST on February 22, 2016 to the Contract Specialist, Katherine.M.Kearney@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>**Seeking Sources**<br /><br />Install a new access control system to replace and/or upgrade the existing KeyScan system. This upgrade will provide additional functionality that the administrators of the system installed on the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy (USCGC Healy) do not currently have. This additional functionality includes the ability to use their FIPS/TWIC cards (common access cards) instead of their separately issued access control cards enabling USCGC HEALY to meet Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12. The proposed system will allow for an "In/Out Status" screen that is the primary user interface displaying real-time status for the secure gate system and the ability to display the ship's crew broken down by Department and division. In addition, this screen can be updated with a single click of a mouse, or it will update automatically approximately 60 seconds after common access card has been swiped. This proposed new system also includes an "enrollment reader" which will be used to enroll/program the users FIPS/TWIC cards into the system. The FIPS/TWIC card functionality will require contractor to provide network/server &amp; operating software (windows 10) that is SQL compliant. This will require some coordination between contractor and USCGC Healy technical personnel to deploy. The new hardware will connect to the existing cable, lock power supply, and connection to customer's network, which are all good working condition and is fully usable for the new system. The following are mandatory provisions for the award of the contract.
<p>1.) An In/Out Status Screen that is the primary user interface displaying real-time status for the secure gate system and the ability to display the ship's crew broken down by Department and division.</p>
<p>2.) The ability to change a member's In/Out Status automatically however, a manual ability to change the member's status shall be an alternative, in case there is trouble with the Government Issued Cards (PIV/TWIC).</p>
<p>3.) Incorporate K-smart -GOV readers (FIPS201) Federal Information Processing Standard compliant readers to meet Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12. We would like the upgrade to consist of four 201 Card Readers and associated hardware.</p>
<p>4.) The secure gate system must to maintain the manual ability to defeat/override the magnetic security device.<br /><br /><br />Please send all technical questions regarding this potential opportunity to AL.L.MCNEAL@USCG.MIL<br /><br />We are currently seeking sources that will be able to give us a broad range of potential security upgrades to our security gate system. There will be restrictions on software that can be discussed with technical personnel.</p>

<RESPDATE>012816
<CONTACT>Ashlee Tuck, Contracting Officer, Email atuck@usaid.gov - Ayana Angulo, Contracting Officer, Email aangulo@usaid.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) which intends to obtain information about interest, capabilities, and market information related to the proposed activity entitled "Solar Power Systems at Rural Health Posts - Zambia."<br /><br />Lack of electricity in most rural health posts, exacerbated by the current acute load-shedding crisis throughout the country, has adversely affected the quality of health care, worsening health outcomes, putting the lives of thousands of people at risk, and undermining substantial USG investments in the health sector.  In health centers and health posts electricity is needed to provide lighting and for refrigeration to maintain cold chains for life-saving medicines, undertake laboratory tests, vaccines and blood products that are critical to prevent childhood illnesses, respond to medical emergencies and mitigate epidemic risks.
<p><br />With little prospect of the national grid being extended to most of Zambia's rural areas in the near future, and with solar technology  becoming an increasingly cost-effective long-run energy solution, the provision of rooftop solar systems offers the best way to substantially improve access to quality health care in rural areas.  Power Africa Zambia proposes to work with USAID/Zambia's Health team and the GRZ's Ministry of Health to bring electricity to almost 600 off-grid rural health centers over a five-year period, serving an estimated 2 million patients, ensuring a referral chain by linking health posts in the most under-served areas, and powering sectors of referral hospitals that are often left without power given the load shedding and macro-economic situation, which makes the provision of fuel and maintenance of generators difficult.</p>
<p>This activity will also be explicitly designed to catalyze the commercial rooftop solar industry in rural communities.  Successful utilization of these solar systems, coupled with marketing efforts and the development of solar operations and maintenance capacity, will stimulate demand from other users - households, businesses and government offices.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than February 2, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

<CONTACT>Robyn Peters, Email Robyn.Peters@tsa.dhs.gov
<DESC><br />TSA Office of Security Capabilities (OSC), the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI), and Washington Homeland Security Roundtable (WHSR) will host a Technical Exchange Meeting (TEM) to discuss Open Architecture and Standards for future security screening capability.
<p>The meeting will be held on:<br /><br /><strong>Monday, February 8, 2016 from 8:30 to 4:30 at The MITRE Corporation, 7525 Colshire Drive, McLean Virginia 22102.</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, TSA engaged with industry on the development of TSA's Strategic Five Year Technology Investment Plan for Aviation Security. One of the themes that emerged in the plan was the need to explore a "system of systems" approach that leverages a more open system architecture. Over the past year, TSA has initiated efforts to define the future architecture for capability and would like to continue the collaboration with industry.</p>
<p>The purpose of the TEM is to create a forum for TSA and interested industry members to begin a technical exchange regarding data and interface requirements for future screening capability (passenger and checked baggage). TSA will continue to engage industry to define a common vision for an adaptable, multilayered and risk-informed approach to aviation security. A key feature of this vision will be an open architecture, adapted to industry standards for image, data exchange, and interfaces that will facilitate the development of new security screening capabilities and integrate data, technologies, and processes within and across airports.</p>
<p>The morning session of the TEM will consist of a series of briefings by TSA and partners to cover ongoing activities and how they may impact strategy for future acquisitions. The afternoon will consist of two breakout sessions to have technical discussions with industry regarding sensor and data formats, and interface requirements. During these sessions, subject matter experts from industry can interact with FFRDC, National Laboratory, and government employees to share challenges and ideas associated with interoperability and open architecture, especially with regard to future screening systems and components. <br /><br />It is not envisioned that strategies, requirements, and issues will be fully developed and/or resolved during this meeting. Subsequent discussions will take place through additional engagement activities as well as the potential formation of a Community of Interest (COI). For more information on the Technical Exchange Meeting please visit WHSR at <a href="http://www.whsroundtable.org">http://www.whsroundtable.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To Register for the TEM, please visit:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.whsroundtable.org/TSATEM">http://www.whsroundtable.org/TSATEM</a> </strong></p>
<p>Registration opens at NOON EST, Wednesday, January 20, 2016.</p>
<p>Registration is limited to 125 participants, with a maximum of 2 representatives from each organization, and open to both WHSR members and non-members. Ideal participants include representatives from equipment manufacturers, integrators, engineering and technology firms. All registrants will be provided with directions to MITRE and free parking is available on the campus. MITRE is also Metro-accessible via the McLean Station on the Silver Line. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued ID for admittance.</p>
<p>HSSEDI is operated by MITRE, a not-for-profit organization that operates federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) sponsored by the United States government. WHSR, founded in 2003, is a 501c(6) non-profit group of individuals from companies who are actively engaged in homeland security policies, practices, procedures, and procurements as a user or supplier of homeland security equipment or services.</p>

This project includes the demo of chilled water to all buildings supported by a Central Energy Plant (CEP) and replacement with a condenser water loop system for ground source heat pumps in the barracks and a heating water loop for domestic hot water. This project also requires providing 40% domestic hot water with solar for the barracks.</p>
<p>In this Statement of Work (SOW), there are eight (8) barracks buildings. In accordance with FARs Part 36, the estimated construction price range for the 8 Barracks Buildings is more than $10-$100 Million. <br /><br />The Estimated duration of the project is 720 calendar days</p>
<p><br />Project Labor Agreement:</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Mr. John H. Rodgers, at John.H.Rodgers@usace.army.mil and courtesy copy the Contract Specialist, LaTorie M. Bivins, at Latorie.M.Bivins@usace.army.mil no later than 3:00 p.m., 2 February 2016.</p>

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services.<br />2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Dec 2014), which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

<p>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST (NOV 2008)<br />If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible Contracting Officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>

When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a Contractor employee, the employee and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to turn the employee and the vehicle over to appropriate civil law enforcement officials, and action may be taken to suspend, revoke, or deny clinical privileges as well as installation driving privileges.

At the close of operations each day, the Contractor shall be required to make a thorough inspection in each work area to determine that all necessary safeguards relative to probable fire hazards are in effect. The Contractor shall familiarize his employees with the aforementioned fire regulations, location of fire reporting telephones near work sites, and correct fire reporting procedures. The Contractor and his employees shall be cognizant of and observe all requirements for handling and storing combustible supplies and materials, daily disposal of combustible waste, trash, etc.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Questions must be submitted to the following e-mail address: juana.m.astudillo.mil@mail.mil. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Registered Nurse Services for the Emergency Room.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994) (Public Law 103-355) &amp; FAR 37.4, Non-Personal Health Care Services Contract (10 U.S.C.2304 and 41 U.S.C.253). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Great Plains Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price, Non-Personal Health Care Service, Commercial Type Contract in response to Request for Quote (RFQ) 16-RB-021. This is an unrestricted solicitation. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621399 and the Small Business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />The contract resulting from this solicitation is a Firm Fixed-Price, Non-Personal Healthcare Service Purchase Order.<br /><br /><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /><br /></strong>January 2016 through June 2016<br />&nbsp;
<p><strong>SECURITY CLEARANCE:<br /><br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>The Contractor will need a DUNS number, TIN number, and be registered with www.SAM.gov.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</span></p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was es-tablished to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procure-ment is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protest-ers must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting<br />`more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>

<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>A--NASA NEXT GENERATION SPACE RELAY ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT STUDY
<SOLNBR>NNC16ZLC002L-2
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>021916
<ARCHDATE>12152016
<CONTACT>Brian Huth, Contracting Officer, Phone 2164336693, Email brian.s.huth@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center hereby issues the following Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Architecture Concept Study:
<p>NASA invites industry to participate in the definition and analysis of the Nations future space communications and navigation architecture with a focus on the Earth and Mars space relay capabilities. This future system capability will provide the next generation space and ground infrastructure to enhance space exploration and return critical science and exploration data to investigators on Earth from all regions of the solar system. The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Office at NASA leads the architecture study and manages and operates NASAs critical communications and navigation system infrastructure. This study will define a top-level end-to-end next generation (Next Gen) architecture concept that evolves NASAs space communications and navigation networks consisting of NASA, commercial industry, other government agencies, and international space agencies assets and other supporting systems. Next Gen is broadly defined over the next 25 years to the 2040 timeframe and more specifically defined over the next 10 years to the 2025 time frame when initial Next Gen capabilities will start to become operational.</p>
<p>NASA offers a range of world class space communications and navigation services and capabilities to enable the next generation of science and exploration missions and global collaborations. These services and capabilities (e.g. forward and return communications, tracking, navigation aids, internetworking, and timing references) allow missions to share the costs of critical, space and ground infrastructure and eliminate individual and costly mission-specific facilities thus providing a cost effective, national resource for space exploration.</p>
<p>In the coming decade, NASA will look to sustain and enhance its space and ground infrastructure to adjust and respond to the changing needs of science missions and plans for future human exploration of the solar system. The Next Gen relay architecture study will provide a detailed analysis of capability proposed for the future network. A four-month study is envisioned to: apply the needs of NASAs mission use cases against proposed elements of the future architecture; conduct simulations and trades for the proposed implementation of architecture features; define specific relay, tracking, and internetworking capabilities for near Earth (up to 2 million kilometers) and/or Mars spacecraft; and provide cost estimates of developing, deploying, operating, maintaining and sustaining the proposed new space relay capabilities over a 20 year window.</p>
<p>The vision for the future network will connect investigators more closely with their scientific instrumentation, reduce both user mission spacecraft and infrastructure burden (resources and cost), apply appropriate aspects of terrestrial communication technologies, enable greater availability and leverage commercial innovations and capabilities and international partnerships.</p>
<p>The study consists of four tasks: Develop the architecture for future relay capabilities in the Near Earth and/or deep space regions Conduct trade studies, modeling and simulation, analysis of future relay capabilities and identify enabling technologies Define and infuse specific near Earth and/or Mars relay elements and their capabilities Develop cost and schedule estimates for future near Earth and/or Mars relay elements</p>
<p>During the course of the study, it will be important to provide a basis for proposed new capabilities via properly analyzed trades, analyses and operational scenarios. The study effort will emphasize the trades and analyses conducted and will be used as justification and supporting rationale for the proposed architecture elements for the entire set of SCaN networks focusing on near Earth and Mars relays elements. Models and simulations developed during this study may be used to explore specific relay elements or capabilities in more detail during follow-on design and implementation efforts. Offerors will be asked to consider best commercial practices and standards, emerging technologies, and compare the current and anticipated capabilities and technologies available to implement each architecture feature below within the near Earth and Mars network architecture. Recommendations will be based upon simulation results or through trade studies with proper rationale.</p>
<p>The study will focus on trades associated with the following architecture features:</p>
<p>Relay Capability integrated functionality relay satellites or disaggregated functionality across a collection of dissimilar satellites providing communications, navigation, and internetworking capabilities</p>
<p>Direct to Ground where/when direct to ground services have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage over relays</p>
<p>Spacecraft burden shared burden (e.g. mass, power, volume, operational complexity) between relay infrastructure and mission spacecraft to increase performance and reduce overall cost</p>
<p>Multiple Access where/when multiple access techniques (e.g. TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, OFDMA, spatial diversity, others) should be used on forward/return links from/to relays in order to simultaneously support the needs of multiple mission spacecraft within the full field of regard</p>
<p>Optical Communications where/when optical links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage</p>
<p>RF Communications where/when RF links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage</p>
<p>Government ownership and operations requirements and mission aspects requiring NASA owned or operated assets</p>
<p>Commercial Service and operations mission/infrastructure aspects potentially met by commercial services Internetworking benefits and burden of providing link layer (2) and network layer (3) services</p>
<p>Security role, approach, benefits, and risks of secure command, telemetry, and science data links</p>
<p>Timing and Frequency Standards common time standards, radiometrics and other navigation aids</p>
<p>User Service Requests means and capacity to support automated requests for communication and navigation services on-demand as well as near term scheduled service</p>
<p>Autonomy where/when in the network autonomy has technical, operational, and/or cost advantage</p>
<p>Cognition adaptive or cognitive communications and networking to improve efficiency</p>
<p>Commonality across elements of near Earth and Mars relays that reduce development or operations costs</p>
<p>Deployment of Relay Elements Launch methods (e.g. primary payload, secondary/ride share, hosted payloads), launch vehicle configuration, number of launches, and cost</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>
<p>INDUSTRY BRIEFING Interested parties are invited to attend an industry briefing at NASA Headquarters Auditorium January 21, 2016, at 300 East Street SW, Room 1G60, Washington DC, 20546. The briefing will take place from 8:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. EST. Speakers from the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program Office will review the SCaN Program vision for future near Earth and Mars relay capabilities, current and future user mission needs, current capabilities, RFP objectives and procurement process.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (PEO C4I) Navy Command and Control Program Office (PMW 150), issued a sole source, ceiling increase to contract N00039-11-C-0039 with Raytheon Secure Information Systems, LLC of Torrance, CA, for engineering services to provide Link-22 MLLC/LLC-7M integration and testing support during both NILE Reference System (NRS) integration as well as NILE Nations System Network Controller (SNC) integration.  The period of performance for these services is one year in duration.  Raytheon is currently completing development of the MLLC, including the KIV-7ML22, a major hardware and software component of the MLLC and is the only cryptographic device that will work within the design of the MLLC.  The KIV-7ML22 is the KIV-7M hardware modified with KIV-7ML22 nomenclature and any additional self-contained hardware and all Link 22-related software required to allow full-capability to operate within the MLLC. Raytheon is the sole source manufacturer of the KIV-7M itself, a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Type 1 NSA-certified device proprietary to Raytheon. The US Government does not have license rights to the core KIV-7M software used for the MLLC.  Given the complex, unique, and highly specialized nature of the MLLC/LLC-7M technology, Raytheon is the only vendor capable of providing the support services that will be required during the integration and testing of the MLLC/LLC-7M and KIV-7M devices.
