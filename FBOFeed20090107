<p>The contractor shall provide human resources with the necessary training, skills and experience level to maintain and operate an up-to-date, efficient Industrial Base Information Center (IBIC) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.

The contractor shall provide all supervision of all contractor personnel. The contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide the Air Force a capability to rapidly research industrial base topics for the purpose of identifying current and future impacts to materiel requirements. These topics include, but are not limited to characterizing industrial capabilities, assessing capacity constraints, preparing forecasts of market demand/supply vulnerability and analyzing the financial viability of suppliers within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).<br /><br />&bull; Be the primary source to identify access, collect and integrate relevant information from multiple government and commercial sources into concise products (reports, tabulated data, and graphics) in support of the sponsor's execution of the Air Force Industrial Preparedness Program (IPP).</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire and utilize commercial information sources (on-line data/technical subscriptions) and other materials and/or services to support the overall IBIC mission.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain a repository of generated products, reference sources and supporting data in the appropriate format (paper and/or electronic).</p>

<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100% small business set-aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 6th CES mission at MacDill AFB and Avon Park, Florida. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Engineering Support contractor. Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,000 to $5,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $150M over a seven-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and six 12-month option periods.<br />.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at MacDill AFB, and Avon Park Range, FL. Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 45-day response time (offers due 45 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project is to Repair Hangar 2 Sanitary Sewer System and Bathrooms. The seed project magnitude is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. MacDill AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors: 1) Mission Capability, 2) Proposal risk; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Pricing. Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used: a) Organizational Structure b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project c) Change and Cost Control Management, and d) Quality Control Procedures. Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance. The sub-factors within Mission Capability are also considered equal in importance. Combined, all three factors are significantly more important than cost or price. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 task order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 27 Feb 2009 and close on or about 45 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey (#2 of 2) for Strategic Sourcing of Various Supplies and Equipment (SAVES) Office Supplies
This is a market survey for the above identified requirements. This market survey is being released in accordance with FAA A.M.S. policy 3.2.1.2.1.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only, and will not be released. Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a screening information request (SIR) or request for proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
This is the second of 2(two) market surveys released for this requirement.  Reference: Market Survey Dated October 7, 2008 entitled: "Market Survey for Strategic Sourcing of Various Supplies and Equipment (SAVES) Office Supplies".
The purpose of this market survey is to seek industry input and comment on both of the proposed concepts of pricing methodology described below, and to allow an opportunity for industry suggestions and recommendations for alternate strategies.
The FAA intends to re-compete the Strategic Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) office supply contract. We are contemplating alternate methods of pricing, from the existing contract which is structured as discounted fixed pricing.  The two methods currently being considered are based on fixed discounts (percentages) on vendor commercial/internet pricing.  The rationale for this strategy would be allowance for the FAA's pricing to adjust with positive and negative fluctuation in the market.  The goal is to improve the current pricing structure, in order to achieve more favorable pricing on the follow-on contract.
The two pricing strategies currently under consideration are as follows:
(1) A single fixed discount (percentage) off of the commercial internet/catalog retail price that is applied to all items.
(2) Multiple variable discounts (percentages) off of the commercial internet/catalog retail price for a limited number of categories.  For example, a different discount would be applied for toner, paper, and general office supplies categories.  
For either scenario, the discount would be off of vendor commercial/internet retail price.  FAA contract pricing would then fluctuate with changes in the commercial price.
Exceptions:
(1) Ability-One (formerly Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) items would be priced as a fixed percentage above the Ability-One committee's price and would not be impacted by any other change in pricing strategy.
(2) Price adjustments for paper products are currently considered periodically, based on the fluctuation in the Pulp Paper Index (PPI).  In the pricing methods currently being considered, there would be no separate process for adjusting paper pricing, as it would fluctuate with changes in the market price.
Market Survey Responses:
A desired response would include:
1)	A statement of whether or not your firm would have the capability to offer pricing in one or both of the pricing arrangements described above.2)	If either pricing strategies are not feasible, describe your recommended approach to achieve the government's goal of restructuring the current pricing strategy to compensate for market fluctuation.3)	Additional comments and suggestions
A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from competition.
Interested companies can register to be notified for future announcements related to this and all other posted FAA procurements by visiting the FAA Website address: http://faaco.faa.gov, which is the FAA "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System. 
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational announcement. No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.

Responses must be received in writing, by the FAA by 2PM EST January 22, 2009.  All inquiries and responses should be directed to:

<CONTACT>Raymond Williams, Contract Sepcialist, Phone 2022835330, Email raymond.williams@irs.gov
<DESC>Preface:   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may award a sole source purchase order
 to DigitalML USA Inc. for EMDO Ignite XML software, annual maintenance and professional support services.  Current market research indicates that this vendor is the only provider of EMDO Ignite XML software including the supporting maintenance and professional services for this software brand.
Requirement:  The IgniteXML tool is necessary to support the development of consistent IRS products for the collection, exchange, and presentation of taxpayer submitted tax return data. EDMO, Application Development, and ETA have worked diligently together to capture, refine, and integrate MeF XML tags into the IRS XML Common Vocabulary. This vocabulary is now being shared with Media and Publications and AMS to ensure integration and interoperability of the MeF electronic data format with the XML structures used to published IRS tax forms and the AMS common business services. Without this XML management tool EDMO, ETA, AD, and Media & Publications will not be able to perform adequate data analysis to ensure continued synchronization of these products through on going development, which will be detrimental to downstream data analysis for compliance and the publication of electronic forms inconsistent with MeF XML schema.
Pre-Solicitation Notice:  Vendors who may be capable of satisfying this requirement may respond by submitting  their company information, system data and a clear and convincing proposal that explains their ability to satisfy the requirement. Responses to this notice must 
be received on or before the indicated response date and time given for this notice.  
All responses should be delivered to: Raymond Williams, Contract Specialist, (OS:A:P:I:F:A), Office of Information Technology Acquisitions, Suite 600, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, MD 20784. Telephone: (202) 283-5330; Fax: (202) 283-4427: Email: raymond.williams@irs.gov. Email is the preferred submission method, however, faxed copies will be accepted.  Important: Vendors must extend a courtesy call at the time their proposals are submitted to give a verbal notice of their submission.  Vendors that may need more information about this requirement may contact Raymond Williams at the address and telephone number given above.  Vendors proposals should not exceed six (6) pages.  Vendors must include the subject and requisition number on their title page to their proposals.  Vendors that submit proposals in response to this notice are not guaranteed an award for this requirement. The IRS will make the determination if this requirement shall be competed among responsible vendors, capable of providing the service.  Vendor proposals received will be considered solely for the purpose of making this determination.  No award will be made on the basis of any quotations, proposals or other information received in response to this notice.  Additionally, the IRS will not reimburse the cost of proposal preparation. Submitted proposals will not be returned.

<DESC>Military Sealift Command (MSC) successfully converted some of its non-bargaining unit status employees to the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) on October 28, 2007.  While a significant percentage of MSCs workforce has already converted to NSPS, the remaining non-bargaining unit status employees at MSCHQ, approximately 230 employees, are scheduled to convert on 29 March 2009.  

The NSPS Program Manager (PM) and Team were responsible for ensuring all pre-conversion tasks were completed expeditiously and accurately.   Proper execution and implementation ensured greater understanding and acceptance by employees of a system that strives to change an organizations culture and values.  The shift from a pay system where entitlements are based on longevity to one where employees are compensated based on their performance and contribution to mission, requires a change in workplace behaviors. The NSPS PM and Team created and fostered increased communication, a culture of engagement, upward feedback and coaching for high performance.  Gaining employee confidence and trust in the new pay for performance system was arguably the most critical and challenging component of implementation.

Post-conversion review of NSPS activities and an evaluation of the mock pay pool exercise highlighted the importance of pre-implementation training, communication and senior leaders involvement.  The NSPS PM and Team will have to design a comprehensive pre- and post-conversion plan and execute all outlined tasks effectively and efficiently.  

The NSPS PM and Team will also focus on assessing and evaluating the MSC NSPS program, implementing process improvements where indicated, and provide sustainment training for those employees that have already converted.  Analysis of the recently completed pay pool process, development of updated MSC NSPS policies to reflect changes in the DoD NSPS enabling regulations, and focused refresher training will be completed to ensure that the MSC NSPS program implementation is a continued success.

The purpose of this requirement is to attain contractor support and expertise that will help MSC to manage the newly implemented NSPS program.

The solicitation resulting from this notice will be available on or about 07 January 2009.  Once the solicitation has been posted, it will be available at www.msc.navy.mil.  Click on Contracts (upper right hand corner), click on Request for Proposal, search for solicitation number N00033-09-R-8003 and follow the download instructions.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon Missile Systems of Tucson, Arizona, for systems engineering and continued development of the Standard Missile -3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile.  This effort is a part of the AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense Program.  The requirement includes the necessary labor and material for systems engineering, design and development, integration, fabrication of test assets, test equipment, ground and flight test support and documentation, integrated logistics support planning and assistance to facilitate the production of the Standard Missile -3 Cooperative Development Program Block IIA missile configuration.  This requirement also includes all up round and weapon system integration services for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Block IIB missile.  Included among these efforts is collaboration between the Ballistic Missile Defense System Kill Vehicle, Kinetic Energy Interceptors, Ground Based Missile Defense, and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program elements to ensure the unitary kill vehicle and multiple kill vehicle payload interfaces to the all up missile and the weapon system are developed to a common architecture with components where applicable.  Work related to multiple kill vehicle capability on the resultant contract will be restricted to multiple kill vehicle payload integration with the Standard Missile -3 Block IIB missile and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program only.  The Ballistic Missile Defense System Kill Vehicle program will perform and manage multiple kill vehicle payload development efforts under a separate contract.  Raytheon Missile Systems has been the All Up Round Design Agent for all Standard Missile variants since 1966.  This contractor is a highly specialized source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  As a result of Raytheon Missile Systems involvement in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program, it is the only source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the system to satisfactorily perform the work.  This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.  The anticipated period of performance is seven (7) years after contract award.  The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Missile Systems directly.

The contractor will provide clinically-based germline mutation testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a manner that is consistent with current clinical practice standards for a maximum of 1,405 participants: 

The period of performance is for one year with two one-year options and one 5-month option. This contract will be awarded as an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with established minimum and maximum quantities.

Myriad Genetics owns the patents on both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes, and is the only known source to the NCI available to perform the required work. The assay procedure employed to identify germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes is difficult and complex. It is essential to the ongoing scientific integrity and validity of the research studies being supported to obtain future data in a manner which will permit reliable comparison with assay results already obtained from GOG-199 subjects who have been tested clinically prior to enrollment in the study. Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable classification of study participants with regard to their BRCA1/2 germline mutation status.

<DESC>Then National Institute of Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Medical Research Council Group, 20 Park Cres, London, England W1B 1AL for a project entitled, Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Life Course Epidemiology. The Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB), NIA has an agreement with the U. K. Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development to provide post-doctoral fellowship training in life course epidemiology to LEDB fellows who will spend one year in London and then 1 year in Bethesda, MD.  This joint training program was formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by Dr. Richard Hodes, NIA Director, and Dr. Dan Longo, NIA Scientific Director, in February, 2007.  As part of this agreement LEDB, NIA will pay an accommodation fee to the MRC for the year that the fellow works in London.  This fee will cover office space, computing facilities, computer, technical support and general support from the facility staff.
The MRC NSHD, also known as the British 1946 Birth Cohort Study, is a prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of all British births that took place in the first week of March 1946.  The NSHD is a socially stratified sample of 2815 males and 2547 females drawn from England, Scotland, and Wales which has been described extensively and remains representative in most respects of the British population.   Since the initial assessment shortly after birth, the cohort has been reevaluated over 20 times.  At the most recent follow-up in 1999, when study members were 53 years old, 3035 persons (56.6%  of the original cohort sample 70.4% of those still alive and residing in England, Scotland, or Wales) were successfully contacted and provided information on their health and life circumstances.  Of these, 1452 men and 1504 women (97.4% of those successfully contacted) were interviewed and underwent physical assessments in their homes by team of 82 trained research nurses. 
A wealth of information is available on the pre-school and school-age years of study participants.  Pre-school data from 3 examinations prior to age 6 assess growth and development, illnesses, health care, diet and living situation.  Extensive information from multiple contacts during school years includes these same kinds of data plus educational and behavioral assessments, including standardized testing and teachers, parents assessments. In 9 follow-ups from ages 19 to 53, data on health habits, risk factors for specific diseases, physiologic measures and disease outcomes were collected.  Extensive information is available on parents and study participants socioeconomic status, including education and occupation.
The study has been extremely productive, with over 300 publications in the areas of health, specific disease outcomes, education, behavioral problems, social and demographic studies, and birth cohort study methodology.  Currently, active research projects are investigating cardiovascular health, diet musculoskeletal disease, cognitive function, womens health, mental health, and respiratory disease.
The 1946 Birth Cohort Study data base is a superb resource that has not been duplicated anywhere in the world.  We are just beginning to learn how the life course influences the aging process, the probability of living a long and a healthy life, and the onset of certain conditions and diseases of old age.  There is a tremendous value in having lifetime data on persons entering old age, but prospectively collected data of this kind has not previously been available to researchers studying aging.  The 1946 Cohort Study has the potential to provide major contributions to our knowledge of predictors of cognitive function, physical function, and disability, depression, bone health, arthritis, heart disease and pulmonary disease.  The proposed NIA-MRC fellowship will offer a unique opportunity to utilize this data base and train with mentors who have extensive experience doing this type of research.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1). The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541711 and the Standard Size is 6.5.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:constance.reedus@us.army.mil">US Army Aviation and Missile Command (Missile)</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company (MDHC) of Mesa, Arizona to provide manufacturing development and engineering support services for the Apache Rotary Wing Aircraft.  The proposed acquisition is directed to MDHC, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Any source other than MDHC would require substantial duplication of time and cost to the Government, neither of which would be recovered through the additional competition, and unacceptable delay would also be incurred in fulfilling the Governments requirement.   An Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Completion and Level of Effort tasks as well as Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Completion and Level of Effort tasks will be utilized.  The period of performance will consist of five-years from date of award.<BR><BR>The purpose of this effort is to provide support and execute the necessary development of state-of-the-art manufacturing technology solutions that will help ensure and improve the quality, affordability, maintainability, and rapid deployment of the Apache Rotary Wing Aircraft Technology.  This effort will provide engineering and technical services associated with programs that encompass the following tasks:  (1) Manufacturing Process Analysis and Development, (2) Technology Development, (3) Engineering Analysis and Integration, which may include component assembly, subsystem, or system level integration, and battlefield level integration for both hardware and software systems, (4) Design and Engineering, (5) Manufacturing Process Definition, and (6) Test and Evaluation. <BR> <BR>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.   The proposed contract action is for engineering services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties that can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government are invited to submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the Government.  This information should be provided to Ms. Constance Reedus at constance.reedus@us.army.mil no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  In your request cite solicitation number W31P4Q-09-R-0211.  The Apache Rotary Wing Aircraft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted by way of synopsis in the near future.   This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.  <BR>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC), Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L)Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000, on behalf of the Project Manager for Joint Lightweight intends to issue a DRAFT solicitation requirement for an Inertial Navigation System to be part of the Digitized M119A2 105mm Lightweight Towed Howitzer.  As line replaceable units (LRUs) the INS shall include an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) which determines gun tube position (latitude, longitude and altitude) and attitude (azimuth, elevation and cant), a Vehicle Motion Sensor (VMS) and mounting devices/assemblies needed for attaching, aligning and shock isolating those items to meet the requirements of PRF-INS-13022772. This is the Performance Specification for the Inertial Navigation System (INS) for the Digitized M119A2 105mm Lightweight Towed Howitzer. The INS may be aided by an external Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver; however it must also be capable of operating in a degraded fashion independently of external aiding.
This will be a  DRAFT Solicitation and announcement of a pre-solicitation conference for a competitive acquisition which is intended to be awarded as a result of a final Request for Proposal (RFP).  Along with a planned live fire test, to demonstrate system performance of submitted samples (less VMS), an integrated assessment will be made by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) from the review of that performance demonstration outcome and the results from evaluation of the factors and sub-factors as set forth in Section M.  Award will be made based on demonstrated performance and the best overall proposal that represents the best value to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the Technical Capability, Management, Past Performance, Small Business Participation and Price. Pre-award surveys may be conducted. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror or to other than the offeror with the highest color rating if the SSA determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511.
The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Firm Fixed Price single award contract with a duration of five years, which includes Design Verification/Qualification testing of the INS to PRF-INS 1302272, delivery of INSs for Weapon System testing and INS production. The required Production Delivery Schedule will be approximately 25 INSs per month.
It is anticipated that this DRAFT solicitation will be posted on the US Army JM&L, LCMC Procurement Network website located at http://procnet.pica.army.mil and https://www.fbo.gov/. Be advised that this notice does not constitute an RFP.  The DRAFT RFP will be issued on or about 03 November 2008. Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database by accessing the CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov  in order to be eligible for contract award.
The point of contact for this action is Paul Fiorello, paul.fiorello@us.army.mil, Contract Specialist, (973) 724-5283, ACC  JM&L Contracting Center, Emerging Technologies Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Numbered note 26 is applicable to this effort.

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS). The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group, Brooks City-Base TX is seeking sources for a requirement to acquire coherent, technically consistent, engineering and manufacturing development support that will enhance the survivability of aircrew members through improved performance, maintainability, and availability of the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) family of ejection seat aircraft (A-10, B-1, B-2, F-15, F-16 and F-22) without aircraft modification.
<p>The principal goals of this effort are to develop and qualify modification improvements that will keep pace with aircraft operational mission requirements, and address aircrew safety issues associated with high-speed/high altitude operating environments. Additionally, this effort will allow for an increase in ejection seat capability to support an expanded anthropometric aircrew range, extended ejection envelope for altitude and speed, and an improved maintainability capability that significantly reduces ejection seat maintenance downtime, resulting in increased aircraft operational availability. The respondent will develop, design, and build prototypes test articles that will demonstrate that a field-level modification can be retrofitted to existing ACES ejection seat aircraft without aircraft modification. The respondent shall furnish all plant facilities, labor, equipment, special tools, test equipment, and materials. Government drawings, tooling, and facilities to manufacture these kits are not available.</p>
<p>The resulting contract will cover all engineering, manufacturing, qualification testing on applicable sub-systems, integration, and any necessary development testing associated with improving the operation and maintenance of the ACES ejection seat. This will be accomplished by incorporating controllable propulsion subsystems to optimize terrain clearance during the ejection sequence, upgrading ejection seat sequencing and sensing subsystems for safer/faster/more reliable operation, and allowing the ejection seat to be removed from its crew station without the requirement to remove the aircraft canopy/hatch, which will significantly increase aircraft availability. Additionally, this contract will address improving the ability to eliminate/mitigate limb flailing during high-speed ejection, and optimizing aircrew accommodation improvements for better access to aircraft controls and improved body position for aircraft operation and ejection. This contract will cover all engineering and manufacturing efforts required in support of trade studies, preliminary designs, final designs, and design verification to determine the merits of the services described above.</p>
<p>Formal responses to this SSS should also detail the experience, capabilities, and rights to proprietary drawings, as briefly outlined above, to the Government. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. PLEASE NOTE THAT TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.</p>

<p><br />PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The United States Air Force is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements of the next generation Presidential fixed-wing aircraft. The current VC-25 Air Force One, based on the 747-200 airframe, was purchased in 1987 and delivered in 1990 with a 30 year design life. As 747-200s have been retired from airline service, parts and maintenance are becoming increasingly expensive. The Air Force conducted an Analysis of Alternatives to examine if it would be more cost effective to maintain the current Air Force One, or to buy a new aircraft. Given the diminishing parts supplier base, increasing maintenance time, and system upgrades that would be necessary to meet future air traffic control requirements, it was found that replacing the VC-25 was the most cost effective option.</p>
<p>The PAR aircraft will be a new-build, commercial derivative, wide-body aircraft, uniquely modified to meet the current and projected requirements for the worldwide transportation of the Office of the President. Modifications regarding passenger communications, information systems, interior work &amp; rest environment, and aerial refueling must be accomplished before delivery of the aircraft. The delivery of the first operationally capable aircraft is required in FY17, with delivery of the second and third aircraft in FY19 and FY21, respectively. The PAR aircraft must maintain the highest possible mission capable rate.</p>
<p>The PAR aircraft will provide the President of the United States, staff, and guests with safe and reliable air transportation with the appropriate level of security and communications capability. Mission communications must provide secure, interoperable command, control, and communications, using net-centric architectures.</p>
<p>The interior must provide a work and rest environment suitable for the President, guests, and traveling staff. The interior configuration must provide the President with ample work and conference areas (including sleeping, lavatory, shower, and dressing areas). The interior must be accessible to the physically impaired. The interior must be configured with galleys that provide the aircrew with the capability to prepare, serve, and store food and beverages. It must also provide for housekeeping and waste disposal.</p>
<p>The modified aircraft will be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, and will meet projected aviation requirements to conduct worldwide flight operations in all civil and military airspace as defined by the FAA, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and Department of Defense (DOD).</p>

<DESC><p>The Bureau is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features in U.S. currency. Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats, including both traditional printing and digital reproduction. Proposed features may be incorporated into the note (inks, substrate), or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any device for verification.
<p>Any technologies or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other production/processing requirements. An effective feature is defined as a feature that cannot be easily simulated or duplicated; for example, a feature that can be simulated to approximate a passable outward appearance or response of a genuine feature is not effective or acceptable.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Bureau is interested in reviewing products, materials, and technologies that will enhance the usefulness of currency notes; for example, authentication/denomination features for the visually impaired and enhancement of circulation life.</p>
<p>Current versions of currency paper and ink specifications, as well as durability testing procedures, are available upon written request.</p>
<p>The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials, for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e., means a proven concept, can provide a sample). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus price information for the purchase of larger test quantities to the BEP, Office of Acquisition, Attn: Larry McCain, 14th and C Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001. Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further assessment. The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted. If you have any questions please contact Larry McCain on (202) 874-0133 or via e-mail at larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov.</p>

<DESC>Then National Institute of Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Medical Research Council Group, 20 Park Cres, London, England W1B 1AL for a project entitled, Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Life Course Epidemiology. The Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB), NIA has an agreement with the U. K. Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development to provide post-doctoral fellowship training in life course epidemiology to LEDB fellows who will spend one year in London and then 1 year in Bethesda, MD.  This joint training program was formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by Dr. Richard Hodes, NIA Director, and Dr. Dan Longo, NIA Scientific Director, in February, 2007.  As part of this agreement LEDB, NIA will pay an accommodation fee to the MRC for the year that the fellow works in London.  This fee will cover office space, computing facilities, computer, technical support and general support from the facility staff.
The MRC NSHD, also known as the British 1946 Birth Cohort Study, is a prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of all British births that took place in the first week of March 1946.  The NSHD is a socially stratified sample of 2815 males and 2547 females drawn from England, Scotland, and Wales which has been described extensively and remains representative in most respects of the British population.   Since the initial assessment shortly after birth, the cohort has been reevaluated over 20 times.  At the most recent follow-up in 1999, when study members were 53 years old, 3035 persons (56.6%  of the original cohort sample 70.4% of those still alive and residing in England, Scotland, or Wales) were successfully contacted and provided information on their health and life circumstances.  Of these, 1452 men and 1504 women (97.4% of those successfully contacted) were interviewed and underwent physical assessments in their homes by team of 82 trained research nurses. 
A wealth of information is available on the pre-school and school-age years of study participants.  Pre-school data from 3 examinations prior to age 6 assess growth and development, illnesses, health care, diet and living situation.  Extensive information from multiple contacts during school years includes these same kinds of data plus educational and behavioral assessments, including standardized testing and teachers, parents assessments. In 9 follow-ups from ages 19 to 53, data on health habits, risk factors for specific diseases, physiologic measures and disease outcomes were collected.  Extensive information is available on parents and study participants socioeconomic status, including education and occupation.
The study has been extremely productive, with over 300 publications in the areas of health, specific disease outcomes, education, behavioral problems, social and demographic studies, and birth cohort study methodology.  Currently, active research projects are investigating cardiovascular health, diet musculoskeletal disease, cognitive function, womens health, mental health, and respiratory disease.
The 1946 Birth Cohort Study data base is a superb resource that has not been duplicated anywhere in the world.  We are just beginning to learn how the life course influences the aging process, the probability of living a long and a healthy life, and the onset of certain conditions and diseases of old age.  There is a tremendous value in having lifetime data on persons entering old age, but prospectively collected data of this kind has not previously been available to researchers studying aging.  The 1946 Cohort Study has the potential to provide major contributions to our knowledge of predictors of cognitive function, physical function, and disability, depression, bone health, arthritis, heart disease and pulmonary disease.  The proposed NIA-MRC fellowship will offer a unique opportunity to utilize this data base and train with mentors who have extensive experience doing this type of research.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1). The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541711 and the Standard Size is 6.5.

<SUBJECT>19--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for a ROM cost and timeline to repair and recertify ASDS-1
<SOLNBR>N0002409N6223
<RESPDATE>012209

<CONTACT>Brian Pelletierphone 202-781-1927 e-mail brian.c.pelletier@navy.mil
Jason Simpsonphone 202-781-2743e-mail jason.w.simpson@navy.mil
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information from industry, including a ROM cost and timeline, to repair and recertify the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS-1).  Repairs could potentially include replacing all components forward of the hatch between the Operator's Compartment (OC) and the Lock In-Lock Out (LIO) Chamber.

DESCRIPTION:  This RFI is being conducted to determine if there is industry interest to develop a ROM cost and timeline to repair and recertify ASDS-1 for manned operations.  On 9 November 2008, a battery fire occurred on ASDS-1 at SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Team ONE compound, in Pearl City, HI.  This fire resulted in significant damage to the ASDS-1 Operator's Compartment (OC).  The repair strategy being evaluated entails the replacement of all components, including the hull structure, forward of the hatch between the OC and the Lock In-Lock Out (LIO) Chamber.  The Government has not made a decision to repair ASDS-1 but responses to  this RFI would help provide information inherent in that decision.  This RFI is for fact finding only and does not constitute a commitment or obligation by the Government to issue an Request For Proposal (RFP), contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor!  will the Government return any data provided.
BACKGROUND:  While completing a charging evolution on 9 November 2008, a battery fire occurred on ASDS-1.  The vehicle has been restored to a safe condition and a detailed damage assessment is being performed by the ASDS Planning Yard.  In order to allow programmatic decisions to be made that will help expedite the repair and recertification of ASDS-1 a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost and timeline is required.  The initial visual inspection of the vehicle revealed significant damage to the OC pressure hull structure and to all the systems installed internal and external to this compartment, including but not limited to hydraulics, high pressure air, oxygen, power distribution, external titanium battery bottles, and external fairings and support structure.  NAVSEA has determined that one of the viable repair options for the vehicle is the replacement of the entire forward section of the vehicle.  The repairs would also include the replacement of all four (4) ASDS hatches.   
APPROACH:  In order to minimize technical risk and expeditiously return ASDS-1 to operational status, if a contract were awarded, the contractor would be tasked, to the maximum extent possible, to repair the vehicle to the existing configuration.  The only exception would be design changes required to address obsolescence issues.  
In addition to reutilizing all the components and structure aft of LIO/OC hatch the Government expects that the following potential items would be GFE:a)	Integrated Control and Display Systemb)	Forward Looking Sonarc)	Thruster Motors and Controllers d)	Anchor Systeme)	Battery Stringsf)	External communications equipment and cryptographic equipment g)	ASDS Hatches
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  These repairs will be completed to restore ASDS-1 to the currently approved configuration, with the exception of design changes required to address obsolescence issues.  The repair effort should include completion of all required post repair testing and recertification requirements, including installation component/system testing, dockside operational, and at-sea operational testing.   
DATA LIBRARY:  The Government will provide an electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder accessibility to the data/documents identified below.  In addition, the documents will be made available at or near the Program Office in the Washington Navy Yard.  The Government does not warrant the content and performance of the design data contained therein:.	ASDS-1 drawings - .pdf files (electronically editable drawings may be available at a later date)
To receive a copy of the electronic library, respondents must submit a request for additional information to: Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Brian Pelletier, Code PMS399, 614 Sicard Street SE, Stop 8840, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-8840, phone 202-781-1927 e-mail brian.c.pelletier@navy.mil.  This request shall include:  Respondent's Name, Address and Zip Code, and Cage Code.  
RESPONSES:  Respondents should submit responses in hard copy and electronic format (.pdf, word, excel, project, powerpoint).  Responses must include the name, position, telephone number, and e-mail address of the Industry Point of Contact (POC) for technical and contractual issues.  Information is desired in the following areas:
A)	Identification of a ROM timeline to complete the repairs.  This timeline should include the anticipated critical path and key milestones for completing the repair in the most expeditious manner.  The responses should identify and address the highest risk areas to meeting the ROM timeline.B)	Technical feasibility and cost implications of conducting repairs at ASDS-1 current location at SDV Team ONE, and if not feasible, identification of required repair location.C)	Identification of a ROM cost to complete the repairs.  This cost estimate should identify the major cost components for the repair.D)	Estimate of the level of effort required to address issues which may result from conducting the repairs utilizing the existing ASDS drawings and addressing obsolescence issues. 
SUMMARY: Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will manage this survey. Respondents may respond to this RFI within 15 days of this notice to:  Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Brian Pelletier, Code PMS399, 614 Sicard Street SE, Stop 8840, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-8840.

I.	Introduction:

The USAID/Guyana Mission is responsible for implementing the U.S Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) two-year, $6.7 million Threshold Country Program (TCP). The primary objective of the TCP is to improve Guyanas performance on the MCCs Fiscal Policy indicator which it fails.  Specifically, the TCP is designed to help the Government of Guyana reduce its large fiscal deficit by improving tax administration, improving budget management and controlling expenditures, educating taxpayers, and strengthening parliamentary oversight.  Moreover, as Guyana also fails MCCs business indicator, the grant will help reduce the number of days and costs associated with starting a business by modernizing and streamlining customs administration and the business registration process. Guyana is plagued with weak public institutions, lack of transparency, high migration rates, poor infrastructure and an economy that needs greater diversification based on private sector investment. . An improved fiscal and business environment should have a positive impact on Guyanas economic development. 
 
The fiscal deficit problem is of relatively recent origin. In 1999 the deficit was 1.7 percent of GDP. However, from 1999 to 2005 the deficit rose from less than 2 percent to 13.6 percent of GDP. Since then the deficit has begun to decline with the successful implementation of the VAT and increased fiscal discipline. However, Guyana was hit hard by oil and food price increases in the first half of 2008 and the governments response  increased public sector wages and temporary tax relief on some staples -- has led to slippages.  Additional fiscal pressures on the budget remain due to spending associated with public sector restructuring, particularly the need to continue restructuring and modernization of the sugar industry.  

Implementation of the TCP began in January 2008 and the program is currently set to run until end-February 2008. While good progress has been made laying the foundation for success in meeting the benchmarks, the capacity of the government counterparts remains a constraint. Achievement of the results will require a strong effort by the government supported by timely and appropriate interventions by the institutional contractor aided by active mission management.     


II.           Basic function of the position:

The United States Agency for International Development Mission to Guyana (USAID/Guyana) requires an experienced Senior Economist to manage the implementation of fiscal and business reforms under Guyanas MCC Threshold Country Plan (TCP). The proposed incumbent must have senior-level technical expertise and practical knowledge and work experience in program management, acquisition and assistance planning, program design, and monitoring and evaluation.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ENERGY STRATEGIC PLAN AND TEMPLATE FOR MARINE CORPS BASES NORTH CAROLINA.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3. (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining market information. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for ! information submitted in response to this RFI, and response to this notice cannot be accepted as an offer. 1. General The U. S. Marine Corps (USMC) plans to assess strategic opportunities to optimize use of energy sources and technologies at Marine Corps installations within geographic, physical, technological, security, legal and market constraints at those installations. From this assessment, we want to create a template that can be used again for planning and developing energy and water reduction projects including projects that increase the utilization of renewable energy resources. We plan to have this review initially for Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in order to obtain a regionally oriented review. By strategic assessment, we intend this effort to address long term issues of energy supply, use, and cost to meet our need for reliable, available energy resources to support our on-going Marine Corps missions at these installati! ons. This is necessarily expected to be a broader and longer term evaluation than is typically conducted in this area 2. Statement of Need Statement (SON) In order to better describe our energy strategic plan and template requirement and define our acquisition strategy, we are publishing this RFI as part of market research to learn and leverage best commercial practices. For project planning and information gathering, the attached Statement of Need (SON) provides a scope and a set of tasks describing our current understanding of the type of study we desire to have done. We seek comment on the approach and desired outcome as well as information on similar studies and results performed for others that align with the apparent goals of the SON. Comments should address the SON from a view that an eventual awardee will be expected to offer a point of view and synthesize recommendations based on knowledge of energy technologies, markets and regional variables and constraints. These recommendations can be expected to guide energy decisions by the Mari! ne Corps in the region for years to come. 3. Information Needed All industry is invited to provide comments on this RFI. Information obtained from this RFI will be used within the USMC and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. With regards to the attached SON, please provide comments/answers to the following: a) Identify a point of contact of someone who can address questions regarding the information you submit (Name, telephone, email, fax). b) Provide suggestions, comments, ideas regarding this process and the task areas identified in the draft SON. We are particularly interested whether the identified task areas provide sufficient detail and information for you to develop a thorough and well-informed proposal. c) Provide, by task area, a capability statement that clearly supports how the industry in general, or your firm specifically, is capable of meeting the requirements in each task area. Provide examples of similar past work accomplished to meet identical or s! imilar requirements in each task area. Please describe the estimated annual and total cost for performing identical or similar requirements. d) If you are not capable of performing work in all task areas, how would you obtain the expertise needed to accomplish the work? Which task areas would require additional expertise? e) Discuss what if any areas of the SON you find vague or require further clarification. f) Provide information on whether or not commercial services or, to the extent commercial services or items suitable to meet the USMC's needs are not available, nondevelopmental services or items, are available that could meet the USMC's requirements, could be modified to meet the USMC's requirements, or could meet the USMC's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent. 4. How to reply Firms interested and/or experts desiring to furnish information should do so not later than 23 January 2009. Responses to this RFI should not exceed twenty five (25) pages. Both email and mail submissions will be accepted. Vendor! s should clearly mark any information that is proprietary. Please send email responses to predeen.aiyelawo@usmc.mil. If you should have any questions, please send those to this same email address. Mailed responses should be sent to: Ms. Predeen Aiyelawo, Contracting Officer, USMC, Regional Contracting Office, NE, 2010 Henderson Road, Quantico, VA 22134. Fax number: (703) 784-3592.

In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and response to this notice cannot be accepted as an offer. 1. General The U. S. Marine Corps (USMC) plans to assess strategic opportunities to optimize use of energy sources and technologies at Marine Corps installations within geographic, physical, technological, security, legal and market constraints at those installations. From this assessment, we want to create a template that can be used again for planning and developing energy and water reduction projects including projects that increase the utilization of renewable energy resources. We plan to have this review initially for Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in order to obtain a regionally oriented review. By strategic assessment, we intend this effort to address long term issues of energy supply, use, and cost to meet our need!  for reliable, available energy resources to support our on-going Marine Corps missions at these installations. This is necessarily expected to be a broader and longer term evaluation than is typically conducted in this area 2. Statement of Need Statement (SON) In order to better describe our energy strategic plan and template requirement and define our acquisition strategy, we are publishing this RFI as part of market research to learn and leverage best commercial practices. For project planning and information gathering, the attached Statement of Need (SON) provides a scope and a set of tasks describing our current understanding of the type of study we desire to have done. We seek comment on the approach and desired outcome as well as information on similar studies and results performed for others that align with the apparent goals of the SON. Comments should address the SON from a view that an eventual awardee will be expected to offer a point of view and synthesize recommendations based on knowledge of energy technologies, markets and regi! onal variables and constraints. These recommendations can be expected to guide energy decisions by the Marine Corps in the region for years to come. 3. Information Needed All industry is invited to provide comments on this RFI. Information obtained from this RFI will be used within the USMC and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.

<ARCHDATE>03142009
<CONTACT>Valerie Tolan, Contracting Officer, (703) 432-4165
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is seeking information about Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) systems that can perform some or all of the core tasks and missions of the Marine Corps Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion (LAAD Bn).  This is not a solicitation but a Request for Information (RFI).  The request is for information about off the shelf, or nearly off the shelf, systems that can be effectively utilized with current and future Marine Corps and Joint platforms.  The request is also inquiring about future systems or sub-systems that will provide enabling capabilities, which may require research and development funding.  The technical readiness level and justification of all systems should be indicated with the submissions.
In those situations where the Marine Corps is operating outside of the joint force's protective air and missile defense umbrella, it must be prepared to provide a point defense capability against specific air and missile threats to include unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, and rotary and fixed wing aircraft, while accepting a level of risk for those threats outside of their defensive capability, i.e. theater ballistic missiles.  The objective of this RFI is to seek solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches that provide advantages over existing platforms by meeting some or all of the following objectives.
The functional objectives documented in the GBAD Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) describe desirable system characteristics that allow the recommended system(s) to defend the Marine Corps against maneuverable Low Observable/Low Radar Cross Section threats:
-	Expeditionary and deployable:  The system should be transportable on expeditionary shipping, air transportable by strategic and theater airlift, and have mobility ashore;-	Agile and mobile:  The system should be maneuverable within the operations environment to maintain the air defense umbrella over the maneuvering forces;-	Networked:  The system must align with future air defense integration initiatives, including: fire control, combat ID, and Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP);-	Lethal:  System should have the capability to defeat the threats mentioned above;-	Precise, effective:  System should provide 360 degree protection;-	Interoperable:  During joint force operations, GBAD will serve as an element of the Joint Integrated Air Defense System (JIADS), under control of the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) with other joint force air defense assets;-	Persistent:  System should provide 24-hour, day/night, and all weather capabilities;-	Flexible:  Scalable capability between missions and threats;-	Adaptable/Tailorable:  System should support austere operations in support of deployed Marine forces as well as integration into the JIADS.
The following information is requested for all systems:
-	The platform and operational concept; -	System description of physical and performance characteristics; -	Description of system function and possible variants within the context of the system characteristics listed above.  For instance, scalable from man portable or part of larger system;-	An estimate of overall cost and if research and development is needed;-	A Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment and accompanying rationale. 
This RFI is issued solely to obtain information and to ascertain capabilities for planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).   Furthermore, the Government does not intend to pay for any information/items, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI.  Responders are solely responsible for all costs and expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI will be treated as business confidential information; however, any proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  Moreover, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  
Furthermore, please include the willingness of the company to respond to further requests for information.  A response to this announcement is not a prerequisite for participation in any future program should such a program develop.  No RFP or other formal solicitation regarding will be made from this announcement.  Providers of the requested information are asked to respond within 30 days of the announcement.  Responses shall be submitted to:

<a href="mailto:dwight.micheal@usmc.mil">The Contracting Officer's email address</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), in collaboration with the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to investigate potential concepts to support the Electronic Maintenance Support System (EMSS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study for a man-portable Electronic Maintenance Device (EMD).  This Request For Information (RFI) initiates a concept call for next generation portable maintenance aids consisting of the hardware, software, peripheral devices and embedded functionality that will support and enhance a Marine's completion of maintenance tasks (e.g., display technical information and schematics, diagnose, repair, test, document repairs, order parts) from fixed garrison type environments all the way to the forward edge of the battlefield. The ability to repair equipment as far forward on the battlefield as possible is a fundamental tenet of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  There is a need for a man-portable EMD that enables implementation of a net-centric maintenance capability down to the individual maintainer level.  The EMD provides maintainers; at the point of repair; with the ability to initiate, affect, and record repair actions into the logistics enterprise and rapidly return equipment to an operational state.  This includes the ability to receive and display Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) and other digital technical data, interact with the equipment diagnostic system, run tests, check measurements, and interface with maintenance and supply systems to record maintenance actions and order repair parts.  Possible alternatives include, but are not limited to: (1) Man-portable laptop with embedded test and diagnostic devices and software; (2) Man-portable laptop with wearable device (e.g.! , monocle display technical data) enabling hands-free interaction with the IETM while maintainer uses his hands to complete repairs; and (3) Personal Data Assistant (PDA) with wearable device enabling hands-free interaction with the IETM while using hands to complete repairs.
The AoA will study each concept's potential as a multiple-use platform and how it might satisfy, or partially satisfy, maintenance tasks across supported systems/equipment and Military Occupational Specialties' (MOSs).  Concepts should address standards for instrument interchangeability (open driver architecture, instrument classes, and shared software components) in accordance with Interchangeable Virtual Instrument Foundation and Navy open system architecture that will allow related programs and test equipment to utilize EMSS capabilities, so that no duplication of effort occurs.  Additionally, concepts should address capability to support: (1) Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM), (2) Electronic Technical Manuals (ETM), (3) Computer Based Training (CBT), (4) standard diagnostic software for engine/drive trains, ordnance, and communications/electronics equipment; (5) capability to interact with platform BIT/BITE; (6) ability to host/support peripheral test instr! umentation, such as multimeter, oscilloscope, and fluid analyzer (General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) emulation); (7) "reach-back" communications from maintenance site to maintenance center and automatic test equipment; (8)  the ability to document maintenance actions and query USMC maintenance information systems from remote sites; (9) self-test capability; (10) diagnostic hardware interfaces to include RS-232, DCA plug, USB, and Firewire; (11) the capability to run and support disconnected operations; and (12) all power requirements.
The Marine Corps is soliciting concepts from industry, federally funded research and development centers, Government laboratories and product centers.  The AoA study may construct Government alternatives from the concepts submitted in response to this RFI.  The AoA will not identify alternatives by vendor, but rather by form and functionality of the proposed EMD system alternative, based on the information gathered from this RFI.  Alternatives will be evaluated based on cost and effectiveness.  Effectiveness is assessed against the Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) and Measures of Performance (MOPs) in the AoA Study Plan.  As necessary, members of the AoA Team may request to meet individually with entities responding to this RFI to gain further insight into the physical characteristics, performance, and cost of proposed alternatives, to include proprietary data that can be released to the AoA Team.  Results of the AoA will be provided to key Government decision makers in anti! cipation of a future acquisition.  Any information provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the AoA.  The Government does not anticipate releasing the results of this AoA to industry.  The information resulting from the RFI may be included/combined with other submissions in one or more alternatives considered in the AoA study.  Any proprietary information submitted may be used in establishing requirements of the future system, but specific offeror information will be safeguarded as proprietary.   
RFI submissions should include: (1) company name, address, point of contact, and email address; (2) a concept overview with description, diagrams, and interfaces; (3) capabilities and physical characteristics of the concept, mapped to key functions, attributes and enabling technology with associated maturity needed to implement; (4) a description of external connectivity capabilities and interfaces; (5) key performance characteristics to enable effective modeling and assessment; and (6) provide (to the extent possible) rough order of magnitude (ROM) life cycle costs/schedule associated with RDT&E, Procurement, Sustainment, and Disposal.  It is most important and requested that vendors submit any and all test data and test reports showing independent (preferably Government) evaluation of their systems that meet the requirements of the characteristics.  Responses should include statements and independent test data that demonstrate how their products may satisfy the Marine Corp! s' requirement.
Potential offerors should note that submissions may be viewed by non-Government personnel.  Under separate action, the Marine Corps may contract for support personnel to provide services such as technical, evaluation, and acquisition management support.  Any such service contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the submitted data and prohibit the service contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.  These contractor(s) may be precluded from proposing on the EMSS effort.   
Interested parties having concepts/products they believe adequately address the Marine Corps EMD requirements are requested to submit three hard copies and one electronic copy of related brochures, descriptions, or other documentation to the following address: COMMANDING GENERAL, MARCORSYSCOM, Contracts - PG-16 (CT 023), Attn: Dwight B. Micheal, Sr., 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia 22134-6050; not later than COB, February 6, 2009.  No telephonic responses or e-mail responses will be considered.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an obligation by the Government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submissio! n of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input submitted in response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 693ARSS-09-HDAM<br />NAICS Code: 336419 Other Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing<br />Subject: The purpose of this request for information (RFI) for a modified control section for the High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), AGM-88C, is to gather information on the capabilities of firms able to accomplish this project. A response to this RFI is required no later than 3:00 PM CST on 23 Feb 09.<br />Description: The 693 Armament Systems Squadron (693 ARSS), Eglin AFB, FL, wants to produce a modified control section for the HARM, AGM-88C, that will help fill capability gaps in our Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) systems and complement today's fleet of F-16C/D. The modifications are required to address the force structure gap until sufficient numbers of 5th generation aircraft and advanced weapons are fielded to assume the SEAD role. The USAF entered into a Cooperative Research and Development (CRAD) Agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems to mature and develop the technology for the HARM Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) Attack Module (HDAM) modification. As a direct result of this CRAD, an approach to satisfy the Air Force's requirement to increase the capability and accuracy of the current HARM, to improve weapon effectiveness, and reduce fratricide and collateral damage in response to the increasingly sophisticated systems now being developed and fielded by potential enemies was realized.<br />Concept: To that end, 693 ARSS is interested in information relating to the following requirements for a potential production program:<br />1) Produce 500 HARM control section modification kits that will: (a) add a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance capability, (b) increase the current control section Inertial Navigation Set (INS) accuracy, and (c) restructure the current AGM-88C seeker software to migrate the guidance function from the seeker to the control section. <br />2) Meet the requirements of Weapon System Specification 2261672 dated September 18, 2006, Missile Prime Item Development Specification 2261673 dated September 18, 2006, and the Control Section Prime Item Development Specification 2261674 dated September 18, 2006 while maintaining the missile interface as defined by AS-5186C dated April 8, 2003 and AS5108D-C dated August 10, 2001. <br />3) Utilize existing Field Level Support Equipment without modification. <br />4) The HARM with modified control section and seeker software will be employed on the F-16 Block 50/52 aircraft utilizing the current LAU-118 launcher which includes the Aircraft Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC). <br />5) No modification of aircraft hardware or software will be allowed. <br />6) No modification of the ALIC hardware or software will be allowed. <br />7) Delivery of modified control sections must begin 18 months following contract award.<br />Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:<br />&bull; Provide information outlining your capabilities and your approach to satisfying the above requirement, to include: <br />o Evidence and/or a proposed plan that all technology elements of the design approach will meet a minimum of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, as defined by the Air Armament Center.<br />o Evidence and/or a proposed plan that manufacturing readiness for the design approach and associated production readiness factors will be at least a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8, appropriate for production of a system, as defined by the Air Armament Center.<br />o Evidence to enter into testing, to include aircraft integration testing, and associated F-16 aircraft development test and evaluation testing, 12 months after contract award.<br />o Evidence to meet ramp rate of 5 units 18 months after award, 15 units the next month, and 20 units for each of the remaining 24 months.<br />&bull; Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for non-recurring engineering, to include acceptance testing of factory test equipment; test and evaluation, including qualification and ALIC interface testing; and production of 500 modified control sections.<br />&bull; Assumptions regarding any Government furnished material and/or equipment.<br />Disclaimer: This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

<DESC><p>Industry Day Advance Notice and Request for Information<br />For The Joint Universal Network Interface
<p>1. This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies and business approaches to enable rapid change of networking functionality of airborne weapon systems for the Air Force and Navy. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. The diverse operations of the joint battlespace require sharing of information between disparate aircraft using disparate networks and data links. Development of platform and network changes takes many years. Synchronization of these changes is extremely difficult. Networking technologies, sensor technologies and weapon technologies are exponentially more capable than just a decade ago, enabling weapon systems to perform new missions, exchange information, and host applications not originally intended. Thus rapid change is required to integrate the all airborne platforms in the battlespace regardless of their service, nationality or security perspective. Information must be exchanged in the anti-access, contested, and permissive environments.</p>
<p>3. The concept is to establish an enterprise approach to develop and employ an airborne networking enclave with a standard universal common operating environment which will decouple network changes from the normal Operational Flight Program development cycle. This universal environment is intended to be installed on all types of airborne systems; bombers; fighters; wide bodies; command and control; special operations; and unmanned air vehicles. This environment must support simultaneous multiple levels of security and provide an open well defined interfaces to permit a common software application be installed in all cross domain airborne systems. This environment will not be processing flight nor safety critical systems or functions.</p>
<p>4. This special notice seeks to identify the technical components necessary to implement the framework of the universal network interface common operational environment with the attributes of the concepts previously described. Also this notice seeks industry recommendations on viable business strategies to realize the concepts. Submissions will be considered up to and including Secret Collateral.</p>
<p>5. To further facilitate communication of DoD's interests and how these potential solutions may address them, an Universal Network Interface industry week will be conducted the week of 2 February 2009 in Dayton Ohio. The Government will articulate the concept of operations and the concepts of needs to industry at large. Industry is encouraged to present their ideas to a government and government contractors in a 1 hour private session. Further information on the Industry week will be published in FEDBIZOPS. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. If respondents wish government support contractors to sign a non-disclosure agreement, please include the form in the response. The government will not use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability, requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>6. This notice is part of the Government's market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" from industry with respect to their current and projected abilities. Only U.S. companies doing business in or based in the U.S. will be permitted to submit any information.</p>
<p>7. Point of contact is Mr. Brian Hicks, 2530 Loop Rd West, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7101, telephone 937-255-9491 or 937-255-2771, email brian.hicks@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY - Robot Intelligence Kernel (RIK)
<p>Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, further develop, use and commercialize the INL's Robot Intelligence Kernel (RIK). License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include usage limitations. The INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.</p>
<p>***Technology Description: The Robot Intelligence Kernel (RIK) is an R&amp;D 100 award-winning software package that gives robots exceptional new levels of autonomy and intelligence. Today's mobile robots lack the intrinsic intelligence necessary to exhibit true independence, and they tend to fail in unstructured environments when external input is unavailable or inaccurate. The INL's RIK addresses this fundamental challenge in one portable software package that contains a reconfigurable suite of perceptual, behavioral and cognitive capabilities. The software can be used across many different platforms, environments and tasks. The RIK integrates algorithms and hardware for perception, world-modeling, adaptive communication, dynamic tasking, navigation behaviors, and search and detection. More information on the technology can be found at http://www.inl.gov/adaptiverobotics/robotintelligencekernel/index.shtml.</p>
<p>***Intellectual Property: The INL has filed nine U.S. patent applications covering this technology and has been issued one patent to date. The INL has also asserted copyright on its RIK software.</p>
<p>***Potential Applications: The RIK can be applied to mobile robots used for national security activities, search and rescue uses, industrial applications, and other fields where mobile robots with autonomy or intelligent control are needed.</p>
<p>***Commercial Opportunity: The INL is seeking industry partner(s) to license and commercialize this technology. Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the commercialization efforts are invited to respond to this announcement by providing a detailed statement of interest no later than forty-five (45) days from the publication date of this notice. The statement of interest should describe the following company elements:<br />1. Related experience<br />2. Demonstrated ability to bring innovations to the market<br />3. Sufficient resources to accomplish further development and commercialization of the RIK<br />4. Interest in performing and/or funding cooperative research at the INL<br />5. Substantial manufacturing and operations presence in the United States<br />6. Preferred license arrangement (such as exclusive or nonexclusive, fields of use, etc.).</p>
<p>Companies deemed appropriate may be provided with further information on the technology. Such information sharing may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license may be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS).  This non-competitive action is being issued by the Department of the Interior - National Business Center on behalf of the Office of Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Management.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition.  The Government has a requirement for continued secure telecommunication system usage of the NLETS secure system.
NLETS provides, within a secure environment, an international justice telecommunications capability and information services that benefit the safety, security, and preservation of human life and the protection of property to the highest degree.  NLETS assists national and international governmental agencies that enforce or aid in enforcing local, state, or international laws or ordinances.  It is the pre-eminent interstate law enforcement network in the nation for the exchange of law enforcement and related justice information
NLETS provides two basic capabilities to users.  It is an international computer-based message-switching system that links together state, local, and federal law enforcement and justice agencies for the purpose of information exchange.  It also provides information services support for a growing need for justice-related applications.  NLETS supports data communications links to state networks using a commercial frame relay service.  All federal agencies with a justice component use this interface, and the Department of the Interior needs to maintain compatibility for communication.  An interruption in service or additional cost in transitioning to a new vendor would be severely detrimental to the Government.  
The period of performance for this effort is for one five-month base period and one option year.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by January 21, 2009 by emailing lauren_c_kunze@nbc.gov. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

TSA employs more than 45,000 security screeners and provides guidance and training to flight crews for dealing with threats on board aircraft.  Since February 17, 2002, TSA has been responsible for all civil aviation security functions.  Because these tasks are directly related to the screening of passengers at the airport, this space must be located on airport property. 

The Transportation Security Administration intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD<br />(a) NAICS: 334515<br />(b) Number of employees: 500</p>
<p>The purchase of Analog I/O Interface Cards:</p>
<p>Nine (9) PD2-AO-96/16HS (96 channel, 16-bit, 100 kS/s per channel, high-speed PCI analog output board)<br />Fifty-four (54) PD-CBL-4037 (1m 37-way D-sub to 40-way IDC ribbon cable)<br />Fifty-four (54) PD-STP-3716 (16-channel screw terminal panel w/37-pin connector)</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Manufacturer: United Electronic Industries</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only: Purchase of additional PD2-AO-96/16HS PCI analog output cards are required to maintain form, fit, and function interoperability with existing interface cards installed in C-5 Malfunction, Detection, and Analysis Recording System (MADARS) test benches. Usage of any other analog interface cards would require significant modifications to existing test bench software and hardware and would require the utilization of expensive engineering technical resources both in manpower and hardware to modify the existing test benches to accommodate non form, fit, and function interface cards. This translates to work stoppage for ongoing mission critical testing and OFP software maintenance for the C-5 MADARS maintenance data recorder.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-27 dated 10 Oct 08 and DFARS Change Notice 20081124):</p>

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 


(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

These include but are not limited to OUSD(C)PRCP, OUSD(C)CIS, Army and OSD PBAS, Army GFEBS, Navy PBIS, and Air Force AFM. <BR><BR>Question 3: In the RFP, the Government clearly defines activities associated with each Task / Subtask.  However, it is unclear how this maps to software releases and option periods.  Which tasks and subtasks will be performed in which release and which contract option period?  Please clarify.<BR>Answer 3: The mapping of tasks/subtask for specific software releases and option periods can vary dependent upon the COTS solution provided.<BR><BR>Question 4: There does not appear to be an implementation point associated with the end of the base contract period of 3 months and the end of the 3 month long Option Period 1.  What criteria will the government use to determine if the project will move forward and if Option Period 1 and Option Period 2 will be awarded?   Please clarify.<BR>Answer 4: The criteria extracted from the functional requirements document outlined in the RFP.<BR><BR>Question 5: What is the Government's concept for roll out of the solution?  Do they intend a complete solution rollout by Agency or do they anticipate a roll out of functional tasks across all agencies?    How will this roll-out be phased across the 3 implementation points?  Please clarify.<BR>Answer 5: The government anticipates a complete solution roll-out of<BR>functional tasks across all agencies.  The roll-out will be phased such that Implementation Point I is associated with EFD Release I.  Implementation Points II&III are associated with EFD Release II.<BR><BR>Question 6: What is the Government's rationale for having only 3 months between Release 1 and Release 2?  What is the scope of work that the government expects to be implemented in that 3 month period of time?<BR>Answer 6: The scope of work in the 3 month period of time includes Defense Agency distribution capabilities for level 3 and below. <BR><BR>Question 7: In the Government response to Question 8, Amendment 0002, the term Phase is used.  Is Phase the same as Release?  Please clarify.<BR>Answer 7: Yes.  The term Phase and Release are synonymous.<BR><BR>Question 8: In the RFP, the date for Release 3 is 21 months after award.  For pricing Option Period 5, what assumptions should be made about additional development efforts after Release 3?   Should bidders price additional development after Release 3 or is it the government's intention that the EFD solution, complete with reports (per task 6.3), interfaces (per task 6.4) and any customizations, will be deployed by Release 3?  Please clarify for pricing purposes.<BR>Answer 8: Yes.  It is the government's intention that the EFD solution,<BR>complete with reports, interfaces,) and any customizations, will be deployed by Release 3.<BR><BR>Question 9: What is the Government's concept for having a 90 day base period, a 90 day option period 1 and a 180 day option period 2 totaling a 12 month period of time versus a 12 month base period?<BR>Answer 9: The government concept is to reduce risk by providing a short-term option period that will ensure the selected COTS solution is on track.<BR><BR>Question 10: Based on our understanding of the RFP, it appears that during the first 90 days, the contractor is to establish its management plans and setup a Proof of Concept based on the solution demonstrated as part of the BSD. Are there specific deliverables or mini-releases to be met within the next 90 days (Option Period 1)?<BR>Answer: The deliverables for the EFD releases are outlined in the RFP<BR>delivery schedule.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Market Survey
FIRST:  This is an amendment to the Market Survey.  The amendment is issued to extend the closing date for submittal of responses from: January 12, 2009 to: January 26, 2009.   
SECOND: Reference FAA Objectives for Lodging Services included in the original posting.  The following clarification is provided:  1. The FAA objective for lodging services has been described as lodging for 300 rooms per day for 365 days (annually).  The FAA anticipates that individual accommodations rooms will be provided each student.  Apartments with common living rooms and kitchens would not satisfy these objectives but may be described as a market trend or cost effective solution for same or similar type requirements 
2.  The FAA objective for lodging services describe dining on the same property (or adjacent to) the proposed lodging facility to facilitate convenience for the students.  Access to adjacent commercial dining facilities or partnerships with commercial dining facilities may be described as the market trend or cost effective solution for same or similar type requirements.       
3.	Air Traffic Training schedules vary per student. Student enrollment occurs daily and intermittently throughout the year, and students may arrive and depart daily based upon the FAA training requirement. The FAA may deliver training for as many as four shifts to accommodate the number of students enrolled for training.  Currently, the shifts are defined as follows:
06:00 AM - 14:30 PM07:00 AM - 15:30 PM10:00 AM - 18:30 PM15:30 PM -  Midnight (12:00 AM)
4.  The FAA lodging Per Diem rate is $49.80 per day for new hire Air Traffic Control Students.

************************************************************The FAA Academy located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK will train many of the new air traffic controllers in addition to the 4,000+ technical and managerial training courses currently being taught by various media types each year at the center.  The FAA Academy currently provides four training shifts to accommodate the influx of students attending, and scheduled to attend training at the MMAC.  This 75% increase is attributed to an increase in new hire air traffic control students.  The length of training for these students has introduced challenges to the Academy that consists of locating long term lodging within an established budget (comparable to student costs based upon FAA Travel Policy extended-stay fixed rate per diem).  To fulfill future long term lodging needs for Academy students, the FAA Academy is considering contract services to facilitate extended stay-lodging with related amenities.  The  services are anticipated for the period beginning third quarter 2009.  
The Contract services shall provide lodging (and related accommodations) to facilitate a minimum of 300 rooms annually (365 days a year).  Lodging and accomodations will be provided for new hire air traffic control students only.  Contract facilities located within a 10 mile radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73169, and  lodging standards equivalent to AAA - Three Diamond (http://www.aaa.com) are preferred.  
This synopsis is conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS)  3.2.1.2.1 entitled Market Analysis.  The synopsis will assist in obtaining industry involvement, developing and refining the procurement strategy, obtaining price information, determining whether commercial items exist, determining the level of competition, identifying market practices, and obtaining comments on requirements.   This synopsis is specifically issued to obtain participation in the attached market survey.  The FAA intends to review all responses.  The information may be utilized to establish the acquisition strategy and solicitation process when the Request for Offer is issued. This is not a Request for Proposal or Screening Information Request.
Interested sources should respond not later than January 12, 2009 by completing the attached survey, and providing information that describes resources and capability to accomplish the objectives described in herein.

The response should include information that clearly describes market trends, and validates available resources, identifies capability, size business, industry practice, and/or best value in services within the market.

<DESC><p>Next Generation Mail Processing Technologies: The United States Postal Service (USPS) is initiating a new acquisition program entitled &ldquo;Next Generation Mail Processing Solution&rdquo; to identify participants and sources of supply, capable of providing research and development, design, and in or out sourced manufacturing for a new state-of-the-art, automated, mail processing design solution. This solution will be deployed to sort and sequence the high volume of letter and flat mail currently processed within USPS facilities nationwide. This market notice and supply chain opportunity is ultimately seeking suppliers who can offer new or not previously fielded concepts or variations of existing equipment, having an achievable maturation path leading to deployable equipment commencing within the next six years. This initial notice is providing for market research and publication of opportunity, with a following step of additional discussions related to supplier capabilities and qualifications for inclusion within a competitive process toward the above goal. Current Mail Processing Operational Information: Currently, the Postal Service processes approximately 550 million letter and flat mail pieces at 283 processing facilities each day. The USPS segregates letter and flat shaped mail as it enters processing, and this separation is maintained throughout the sorting process. Our existing automated process yields a high volume of sorted mail to a finite number of delivery points. Several high speed processing runs are performed each day to accommodate all delivery points within a single mail processing centers&rsquo; coverage area. Letter and flat mail is manually merged during the final processing operations by our street carriers for delivery to the addressee. NGMPS Program Objectives: The NGMPS Program Objective is to deploy a system solution which will be capable of efficiently, reliably and accurately delivery point sequencing both letter and flat mail simultaneously within a merged mail stream and within the same system. As space is a cost consideration for the USPS, the solution should utilize and accomplish this task within the smallest footprint possible. The required output of the system is a single, combined mail stream for letter and flat mail in delivery point sequence order. Designed solutions should consider the use of specifically designed letter and flat mail input subsystems, or use feeders currently deployed within the Postal Service. Deployment of equipment to individual delivery units is not desired and does not meet the Postal Service&rsquo;s future vision. Competitive factors for success will be sort and sequence accuracy, time to process, and the systems ability to support our established high standards of service for the American people. Additional factors are projected to be development cost to bring to market, system reliability, accept rate, labor cost to operate, and overall space required to accomplish the mission. Finally through NGMPS, the USPS seeks a system which can be deployed nationally and incrementally to provide maximum flexibility to delivery point sequence letter and flat shaped mail within existing and future Postal Service infrastructure. Future Mail Trend Impact on NGMPS: Research indicates a shift in mailing trends propelled by the numerous means of communication options available to business and consumers today. These trends are characterized by slower mail volume growth and continued increases in the number of delivery points. As volume growth slows, emphasis must shift to accommodate more delivery points with less volume. A new solution with processing based upon the volume of mail available, with delivery points as the variable, would provide an opportunity to streamline operations. Processing letter and flat shaped mail on one system (using either a single induction feeder or multiple induction feeders to accommodate the varying mail shapes) would eliminate the manual merging process, improve efficiencies, and reduce costs. The most efficient processing scenario would be a one feed solution for letter and flat mail, independent of delivery points, limited only by a maximum volume, which would provide a merged letter and flat mail product in delivery point order. The NGMPS Program is seeking such a solution. NGMPS Acquisition Approach: The Postal Service will provide for a supplier prequalification and competitive process through identified Phases leading to test and production deployment. The Postal Service is reviewing alternative approaches to ensure that it provides for selection of a best value solution which ensures supply base availability to support future deployment phases, quantity acquisitions, and system upgrades. Suppliers interested in responding to this announcement wishing to participate in this program should send their contact information to Ms. Tammi Robinson-Minor, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, United States Postal Service, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22082-8150. Email address is tammi.robinson-minor@usps.gov. Telephone: (703) 280-7885. Telephone inquires and questions will be addressed, however, for action concerning participation, inquiries must be in writing. Suppliers should provide for notification of interest as soon as practicable, and in no event later than December 15, 2008. Upon required written notification of interest, the USPS will provide additional information for supplier response within a prequalification process, with successful suppliers moving forward to Request for Proposal (RFP) participation. NGMPS Phase I Acquisition Schedule/Time Line: It is envisioned that development and deployment of the NGMPS will be contracted for in phases. Phase I will include a study, concept design, and simulation deliverable. Simulation analysis is critical in demonstrating the potential USPS return on investment of the developed concept to substantially and positively impact USPS infrastructure in mail processing, transportation, logistic and delivery operations. Phase II is planned as an equipment build and component test phase, with participation planned for those suppliers, and their manufacturing source if applicable, who submitted concept designs and simulations which were considered by the Postal Service as best value in the ability of the design concept to meet operational needs. Phase II will be divided into subsequent &ldquo;equipment build&rdquo; phases, which might include major component bread board, prototype, or pre-production phases depending upon the maturation level of the proposed solution. It is anticipated that the USPS will issue a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to pre-qualified sources in January 2009, and that contracts for Phase I as described would be awarded no later than April 2009.

LOCAL TIME ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2009, either via email to:  Cynthia.Davenport@va.gov or by Fax # 228-523-4324 to ATTN:  Cynthia Davenport, Contracting Officer.THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO FIRMS WITH AN ESTABLISHED WORKING OFFICE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF THE VA GULF COAST VETERANS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, 400 VETERANS AVENUE, BILOXI, MS 39531.THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) CONCERNS.  Offers from other than SDVOSB concerns will not be considered and shall be rejected.  The firm must be SMALL under the applicable North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code, which is 541310 with a size standard of $4.5 million, and the firm must be REGISTERED and CURRENT in the following websites to be eligible for award:http://vip.vetbiz.gov,http://www.ccr.gov, and https://orca.bpn.gov .The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS, is seeking an architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, the following.Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square floor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.

A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCAD 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.Qualified firms are required to submit: Two (2) copies of Standard Form (SF) 330 (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms), Part 1 and Part 2 to VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Attn: Cindy Davenport (90C), 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, MS 39531, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Local Time), January 9, 2009.

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the criteria listed in FAR 36.602-1.  Qualifications will also be evaluated based on specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including design of Surgical Suites for VA and other Health Care Facilities.  After the evaluation of submissions in accordance with the evaluation criteria three or more of the most highly qualified firms will be chosen for interviews to present their approach to the design to arrive at selection of the number one firm for negotiations.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.    Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
