<DESC>Opportunity to Partner with Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge System to submit competitive proposals for funds available through the Joint Fire Science Program. Posted date:  Sept 25, 2006 Original Due Date for Applications:  Nov 1, 2006 The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) will establish a firm deadline for submitted proposals when the proposal announcements are released on October 13th,, 2006.  On October 13th, 2006, it is imperative that interested parties check the JFSP website http://jfsp.nifc.gov/ to ensure that your proposal idea is compatible with one of the eligible announcement categories and its requirements.  Discussions as to the competitiveness and viability of your organization's proposal ideas necessitates that you contact Region 7 no later than November 1st, 2006.  This will allow sufficient time for further development and refinement of our scientific proposal into a partnership package suitable for submission to the Joint Fire Science Program.  Applicants should expect the proposal deadline to occur in mid-December, 2006 for receipt by the Joint Fire Science board in Boise, Idaho.   Explanation of "other" category of funding activity: This notice is an opportunity for interested parties to discuss their proposal ideas which may lead to potential partnerships with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Region 7 - Alaska).  This is not a commitment of funds by Region 7 as any resultant awards will come from the Joint Fire Science Program through Region 7 to your organization.  Discussions and development of proposals ideas with the Service does not constitute federal endorsement of your organization or methodology.  Neither will costs incurred during proposal development be reimbursed in the event your project is not among those selected for funding by the Joint Fire Science Program.  Discussions and partnerships will only be entertained if there is definitive relevance to the National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska.  Description: The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 is seeking potential scientific partners to submit a proposal to the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP).  "The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) was established in 1998 to provide scientific information and support for wildland fuel and fire management programs. The program is a partnership of six federal agencies; the Forest Service in the Agriculture Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Geological Survey, all in the Department of the Interior. All JFSP projects require scientist-manager partnerships along with strong emphasis on transferring research findings to the field.  Guidance for the program includes four purposes all related to wildland fuels:  Fuels inventory and mapping, Evaluation of fuels treatments, Scheduling of fuels treatments and Development of protocols for monitoring and evaluation.  In 2001, Congress further directed JFSP to expand its research efforts in post-fire rehabilitation and stabilization, local assistance, and aircraft-based remote sensing.  JFSP research also examines air quality, smoke management and social aspects of fire and fuels management. In setting priorities for funding, the program responds to congressional direction, recommendations from advisory committees and member agencies along with collective input from key agency personnel, workshops and informational meetings.  The program focus is on short-term, applied research that provides information and tools to specialists and managers, helping them make the best possible decisions and develop sound, scientifically valid plans.  The JFSP encourages proposals from all interested parties.  However, because the focus of the JFSP is on wildland fire and fuels issues on Federal wildlands, evidence of direct involvement by Federal scientists or land managers in the development of the proposals must be included in the proposals.  Proposals that do not have evidence of direct involvement by Federal scientists or land managers will not be considered for funding.  Examples of documented involvement by land managers or scientists include participation as a Principal Investigator, cooperator, or collaborator; letters of commitment and support; written evidence from the manager that the proposal is responding to an urgent fire or fuels problem related to the land manager's unit."   Interested and capable parties with scientific proposal ideas for the undertaking of studies in Alaska who can demonstrate relevance to both the JFSP's Announcement for Proposals (AFPs) and to Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge System are encouraged to contact us to discuss a possible partnership.  There is no Region 7 specific solicitation packet, nor is there a "bidder's list" to get on.  This is an opportunity for you to come to us with competitive ideas that fit within the programmatic description (see http://jfsp.nifc.gov/). A "twin" posting of this announcement # 701817R002 is posted to both Grants.gov and FedBizOpps.gov as any resultant awards may occur, as legally appropriate, through either Procurement Instruments or Financial Assistance Awards (Cooperative Agreements or fund transfers within existing CESU Agreements).  Interested parties must contact Karen Murphy, Regional Fire Ecologist, or Mary Kwart, Regional Fuels Specialist, at 1011 E. Tudor Rd, MS 221,  Anchorage, AK 99503.  Phone Karen at 907-786-3501 or Mary at 907-786-3985; Fax 907-786-3905; E-mail Karen_A_Murphy@fws.gov or Mary_Kwart@fws.gov to discuss competitive ideas no later than November 1, 2006.

<DESC>The project involves the following:  

The General Contractor for this project shall provide all material, equipment, and labor to construct eight structures, consisting of Administration/Medical, Educational Center, Vocational Center, Recreational Facility, Kitchen/Cafeteria, Maintenance/Storage Facility and two Dormitories. The Project also includes miscellaneous site improvements, such as utility installations, site/security lighting, sidewalks, roadways and landscaping.  The gross square footage of the eight structures is approximately 146,000 square feet.

The contractor shall begin performance within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the Notice to Proceed (NTP) and complete it within 465 calendar days.  The substantial completion shall be accomplished within 420 calendar days of Notice to Proceed (NTP).  

The estimated cost range is over $10,000,000.  

Plans and specifications will be available on October 16, 2006, only from the Architect/Engineer firm, Stuck, Woods, Allison Architects, 1308 S. Main Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72202-5034.  Contact Mr. Gene Castin, Project Manager, at 501-378-0059, for additional information.  COLLECT CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.   It is emphasized that requests for plans and specifications must be submitted in writing and directed to the A/E firm listed above to ensure proper handling of requests.  Requests must be accompanied by a $200 refundable bid-deposit in the form of a certified check, cashiers check, or money-order made payable to the U.S. Department of Labor. Please provide your EIN number (Tax ID number) on each check and/or money order.     Failure to do so may result in your deposit not being refunded.  Bid Deposit Refunds will be made prior to award of a contract to those firms returning the bidding document, including plans and specifications, to the A/E in good and useable condition.  THE BID DEPOSIT FROM THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER WILL BE RETURNED FOLLOWING THE AWARD AND ISSUANCE OF THE NOTICE TO PROCEED.  One complete set of the Specifications and Drawings will be made available - on a first-come, first-serve basis until the initial supply is exhausted -- for pick up at the A/E's office, or delivery may be arranged at an additional charge.  Any additional shipping charges must be pre-paid, and COD requests will not be accepted.  Additional sets requested from interested parties subject to bid-deposit requirements, or for requests made after the initial supply of the IFB documents has been exhausted, will be available for a non-refundable pre-paid fee not to exceed the actual cost of reproduction of the IFB documents, plus a shipping charge based on each individual request (if applicable) will be required in order to obtain the IFB documents.

Selecting a sole-source vendor will ensure long-term compatibility and expedite migration of LMR network management. The intent of this notice is not to request competitive proposals. However, all responses received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Please direct any questions concerning this NOCA to Adam Correau at 781-377-2579 or by email at adam.correau@hanscom.af.mil.

This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. a)	Northrop Grumman is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source for the AN/AQS-14 and AN/AQS-24 AMCM Sonar systems.    As such, only Northrop Grumman has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  Northrop Grumman is the sole developer of the AN/AQS-14 and AN/AQS-24 AMCM Sonar systems.  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of these systems.  Northrop Grumman is the Depot facility for the above AMCM systems.  By NAVSEA PMS-495 direction, Northrop Grumman is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the AN/AQS-14A and AN/AQS-24 systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at Northrop Grumman under Contractor control. b)	Given the complexity of the AN/AQS-14A and AN/AQS-24 systems and the level of system knowledge required to overhaul and repair this complex equipment and systems, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking. c)	This is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a contract to Carleton Technologies Inc., Tampa, Florida to refurbish, assemble, test, and deliver 282 upgraded MK 16 MOD 1 Underwater Breathing Apparatus making it the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA).   This procurement includes spare parts and soft goods kits to maintain the NUBA for a minimum of two years.   Under this contract effort, Carleton Technologies will also provide testing support services to verify Environmental Conditions, Transportability, Electromagnetic Interference, and Influence Signature requirements.  Carleton Technologies will also provide the necessary labor and resources required to establish and perform interim depot level (D-level) maintenance and repair support.   Finally, Carleton Technologies will provide Operators and Maintenance training sufficient to provide the necessary information, skill development, and pr!  actical application required by the student to set up, check out, operate and perform preventative maintenance on the NUBA.   These NUBAs are being refurbished and reconfigured for delivery to the fleet.   The Requirements Document for Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus identifies the need for EOD forces to destroy and/or neutralize underwater mines.  The Mk 16 Mod 1 is currently fulfilling this need, but is doing so with reduced reliability and long dive setup times.  The MK 16 Mod 1 is an analog, electronically controlled, fully closed circuit, mixed gas, constant partial pressure breathing apparatus.  The upgrade will modernize the electronics to a digital system, increasing reliability while reducing dive setup time and cost.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Technologies is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 16 UBA.  As the OEM, only Carleton Technologies can accurately perform all of the refurbishments a!  nd upgrades to the MK 16 to successfully transition the system to NUBA .  The Mk16 is a certified life support system.  As such, only approved components can be used on the system.  In summary, Carleton Technologies is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK16 UBA.  Use of another company to refurbish and reconfigure the currently fielded UBAs would result in extensive requalification and certification testing which is cost and time prohibitive. NAICS Code:  541990, Size Standard:  500.    A contract will be awarded on or about Jul 06 on the basis of the proposal submitted in response to the RFP.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.  NSWC PC plans on releasing the solicitation electronically only.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source requirements contract to ADI Limited, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Division, Cowper Wharf Road, Garden Island, Australia, for the acquisition of six (6) Advance Acoustic Generators (AAG); six (6) Infrasonic Advanced Acoustic Generators (IAAG); six (6) radio/Sweep track monitors; twelve (12) programming boxes; three (3) hydraulic test benches (p/n IAAG-A9500); three (3) sets of special tools for maintenance and overhaul of the AAG and IAAG; six (6) sets of ship support material; and three (3) spares packages.  The AAG is a water driven turbine powered acoustic generators that produces ship emulation and can be integrated with any sweep system.  The IAAG is the low frequency variant of the Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG).    This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The AAG and IAAG are unique equipment that is only manufactured by ADI Limited.  No other company manu!  factures this type of equipment. There are no distributors.  The AAG and IAAG are microprocessor controlled, so the sound produced can be varied.  The AAG and IAAG are proprietary to ADI Limited.  NSWC PC has successfully evaluated the AAG an IAAG for use in the US Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Fleet having acquired the equipment under contract N61331-06-C-0030.  Use of alternate equipment will invalidate these tests.  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to the AAG and IAAG would require extensive development funds that ADI has already expended and will not be cost effective for the US Navy.  Additionally, numerous patent issues could require resolution.  In summary, the AAG and IAAG are only available from ADI Limited.  Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407.   NAICS Code:  334419; SBA Size Standard:  500 employees; FSC Code:  5845.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Florida intends to solicit General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS), Inc., 1400 Key Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209-1518 on a sole-source basis for Phase Two of the development of the Protector System.  Phase One initiated in FY 05 as a part of NSWC PC’s support of Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration and the integration of the General Dynamics Protector System.  The Phase One contract was awarded through the Defense Microelectronics Activity.  While GDAIS provided multiple technologies for Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) during the Integrated Technology Demonstration (ITD-4), one has been identified as key for further development, integration and testing.  This technology, based upon GDAIS expertise in bio-aerosol sampling, detection and identification, is the focus of the Protector Phase Two effort as a follow-on development to Phase One.  Phase Two will continue to improve network and sen!  sor integration.  The main focus will be to further integrate the systems developed by GDAIS into the DTRA SensorNet testbed, thereby providing: 1) More capabilities integrated into DTRA’s SensorNet; 2) More proof of the SensorNet open architecture approach; 3) Further identification, development and refinement of the SensorNet insterface(s) required to support homeland security initiatives (i.e., BioWatch), and; Testing of innovative bio-detection technologies in support of force protection.  The General Dynamic’s PROTECTOR system is proprietary and does not currently support Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that would allow other vendors to interface to this system, but APIs are an objective of the tasking associated with this contract.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies. Size standard is 750 Employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) to conduct a second phase of repository activity for animal models of Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. 

Jackson Labs is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency’s requirement because (1) Jackson Labs houses and maintains the archives of critical previously collected animal strains and data, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct activities proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this effort. 

Development of the original repository, the Type 1 Diabetes Repository at Jackson Labs (T1DR; http://www.jax.org/t1dr/index.html) was initiated in 2001 and supported by NIDDK through a supplement to an existing NCRR resource, the Induced Mutant Repository (IMR). Strain importation and associated studies and data collection were begun in 2001. To date, the T1DR has imported and archived nearly 150 strains important for diabetes research, and distributed over 500 mice to 100 independent investigators.  In addition, disease incidence studies have been performed on nearly 20 of the imported recombinant strains within the context of Jackson Labs vivarium conditions. This ability to measure the impact of genetic changes on Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) within the context of the common and consistent environment provided within the Jackson Labs vivarium was a necessary and critical component of T1DR research activity in the prior project phase that must be maintained to provide consistency of results in Phase II. Finally, the ability of Jackson Laboratories to distribute T1DR-archived strains to investigators in most cases without the need for additional quarantine procedures beyond what is required for receipt of commercially available JAX strains is necessary to expedite and maximize the efficiency of research.   

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIDDK plans to continue the second phase of the T1DR using a single contractor (Jackson Laboratories). The contractor will continue activities to help identify mouse strains of unique value to T1D research, will import and archive these strains, will verify disease incidence and severity in a subset of the imported strains under controlled housing conditions, and will facilitate limited distribution of mice to the scientific community. In addition, the contractor will provide strain development support services for the NIDDK-funded Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. This activity will require production, housing, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of mouse strains important for advancing research in diabetic complications. 

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Jackson Laboratories is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their unique vivarium conditions and distribution capabilities, and prerequisite knowledge, experience and existing data generated through work performed under the prior supplement provided by NIDDK to the NCRR Induced Mutant Resource grant.

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that would not be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency in data describing disease incidence and severity.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for: SOLAR SIMULATOR PACKAGE (quantity required 1 each) Requirements: 1600 Watt divergent beam (8 inch x 8 inch) full spectrum solar simulator with interchangeable 1600W Xenon full spectrum arc lamp and 1600W UV enhanced Tungsten Xenon arc Lamp. Divergent Beam Housing  should have a power density between 250-1100nmof 124 mW/cm2 (unfiltered). The beam is not collimated but diverges. We also require an integrated high accuracy shutter with an accuracy of +/- 25ms and repeatability of +\- 5ms. A beam homogenizer is also required to produce a uniform output within +/- 7.5% the work plane for an 8 inch by 8 inch beam is 12 inches below the final fused-silica plate. The total gross weight of the beam housing and fan should not exceed 50 lbs.  The 1.6kV power supply should be adjustable in out from 800 to 1800 watts. The power supply should be ultra stable with filtering and internal feedback to reduce the ripple in output to less than one percent. A preview feature should be incorporated to set lamp prior to ignition. Digital displays of lamp power, current, voltage and usage time are desired for selecting exact settings. The power supply must be highly regulated source for constant power or current and must have a standard RS-232 PC interface for remote lamp operation and monitoring.  Also require is an integrated photo feed back digital Timer. The digital timer should be a closed loop system designed to maintain the stability of the Xenon arc lamp as it ages to within a factor of +/- 1%. Photodiodes monitors are also required to compare set level with actual level. The detector response should be spectrally modified to control accuracy at a specified wavelength range. A built in electronic shutter is highly desired. Exposure durations between 10 milliseconds and 9999 hours should also be adjustable in increments as short as 10 milliseconds. Remote shutter operation is desired using either contact closure or a PC. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from NEWPORT STRATFORD, INC. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: Oriel/Newport Stratford has been a leader and innovator in the photonics industry for 40 years and is the sole designer and manufacturer of the 1.6kw Solar Simulator. Only the Oriel/Newport Stratford solar simulator adequately fulfills all of our needs   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 9/28/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a 20Hz-40GHz Electromagnetic Interference Test Receiver Consisting of a Computer-Based EMI Receiver and Spectrum Analyzer. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Rohde and Schwarz, Inc. on a sole source basis. The EMI Test Receiver is being purchased to extend the highest testable emissions frequency from the current capability of 26.5 GigaHertz (GHz) to 40 GHz in support of future NASA projects.  The Rohde and Schwarz ESU40 is the only EMI test receiver which meets all the critical technical and physical requirements for performance and capabilities for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) emissions testing.  The Rohde and Schwartz ESU40 provides a time domain scan option to decrease the radiated emissions RE102 measurement time needed to troubleshoot hardware.  It is the only 40GHz EMI test receiver with a built-in preamplifier that can be turned off under user control to measure high level emissions that would overload the preamplifier and cause inaccurate measurements.  The ESU40 provides a pulse protected RF input that prevents possible damage from high level pulsed input signals while probing circuit board traces with an active Field Effect Transistor (FET) probe to diagnose radiated emissions problems. It has a built-in probe power supply connector for connection to an active FET probe that eliminates the need for a separate probe power supply for troubleshooting printed circuit board emissions. The ESU40 is the only test receiver that has a removable hard disk option for supporting future classified EMI testing. All of these unique capabilities are required in order to satisfy the Government’s needs.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Judith.R.Drabkin@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. CST on October 05, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Abderrahim Bouziyane, Coordination Groupe Extraction et Traitement, Development and Strategy Direction, Office Cherifien des Phosphates, 2, rue Al Abtal ? Hay Erraha, Casablanca, Morocco, 20200 Phone:  (212) 2 99 80 31, Fax:  (212) 22 99 80 31, E-mail:  a.bouziyane@ocpgroup.ma       Morocco Hydroelectric and Seawater Use Optimization Project Feasibility Study.  The Grantee, the Moroccan Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a Feasibility Study on two independent, yet interrelated projects that are integral to OCP's phosphate production operations.

OCP, a state-owned agency formed in 1920, is solely responsible for managing and controlling all aspects of phosphate mining and beneficiation in Morocco.  With more than 50% of the world's known phosphate deposits, phosphate mining and fertilizer production is Morocco's major industry.  The projects to be evaluated in the Study are a hydroelectric power project at OCP's chemical complex in Jorf Lasfar and a seawater use optimization project at OCP's chemical complex in Safi, Morocco.  Both projects are intended to maximize the benefits of OCP's cooling and phosphate washing processes, by recovering the heat and electricity that is currently lost and harnessing it for power supply purposes.  The Grant Agreement is attached at Annex 4 for reference.  The Grantee is soliciting technical proposals from qualified U.S. firms to provide expert consulting services to carry out the Feasibility Study.

The export of phosphates and its derivatives account for more than a quarter of Morocco's exports and one-third of the country's manufacturing sector.  The fertilizer production sector is among the largest foreign exchange earners for Morocco and employs more than 30,000 citizens for both skilled and semi-skilled jobs.  As such, OCP is the world leader in the phosphate market and is Morocco's largest company (employing approximately 20,000 Moroccans).  It is also the world's number one phosphates exporter, with market share of twenty-eight percent.  OCP moved into downstream processing in 1965, converting lower-grade rock to phosphoric acid and fertilizers at its plants along the coast.

Jorf Lasfar Hydroelectric Project

The processing of phosphates requires significant amounts of seawater to be used for cooling purposes.  At its chemical complex in Jorf Lasfar, Morocco, OCP utilizes seawater from the Atlantic Ocean for this process.  OCP would like to increase the benefits of this cooling water system by more effectively utilizing it to recover the hydrokinetic energy created during the down slope fall of the seawater (to the ocean outfall) by installing a hydroelectric turbine in order to generate electricity.  The electricity generated could then be used on-site and/or sold back into the Moroccan electricity grid.  




Safi Seawater Use Optimization

At OCP's chemical complex in Safi, Morocco, a seawater system is also used to provide water for phosphate production processes, such as for sulphuric acid process cooling, phosphoric acid and rock phosphate washing, and fertilizers manufacturing.  The current system in Safi was constructed in three separate phases: Maroc Chimie in 1965; Maroc Phosphore I in 1976; and Maroc Phosphore II in 1981, and is currently showing significant signs of age.  System issues which OCP seeks to address are capacity, quality, intake, flexibility and optimization.

The objectives of the Feasibility Study are to conduct an analysis of the existing seawater pumping and cooling distribution network in order to optimize flows (efficiency, flexibility and redundancy), recover heat from the sulphuric acid cooling system, reduce global pumping and distribution costs, decrease overall energy consumption, and update the system to meet the company's expansion requirements. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $375,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon LOCAL TIME, NOVEMBER 6, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Provide major repairs to the central chilled water plant at Davis-Monthan AFB AZ, on as-required basis, for the period 1 Oct 06 - 30 Sep 07.  Major repair is defined as all requirements exceeding 10 labor hours or $100.00 in materials costs.  We intend to award this requirement on a sole source basis to Honeywell International, Inc. who currently operates the subject plant under Task Order 5C02 of ESPC contract F04626-98-D0103.  The plant was retrofitted with energy saving equipment as part of the TO, and Honeywell (also as part of the TO) assumed responsibility for operation and routine maintenance of the plant for the life of the TO, or some 15 years.  It will be paid for these services as part of the reimbursement of the overall TO.  For anything exceeding routine maintenance, the SOW for the task order states, "...the Government shall reimburse the Contractor for materials, parts, and supplies in excess of $100 per job.  The Contractor is responsible for the first $100 of each item costing over $100 and 10 labor hours."  The services requested fall under this stipulation, and therefore FAR 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements," applies.  The applicable NAICS Code for this solicitation is 811310.  The Service Contract Act will apply.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington to provide a pilot screening of  768 EMS-mutagenized M2 seedlings for mutations at 9 gene targets and to provide the data related to protocols and mutations to GGRU. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is the only contractor using the Tilling Method. The Seattle Tilling Project is the only service with a proven track record in conducting pilot projects on diverse and difficult plant species, having worked with scientists on developing TILLING in over two dozen species http://tilling.fhcrc.org:9366/files/Workshops.html. Critical considerations for this service include proven track record developing TILLING for diverse and difficult plant systems, ensured privacy of data, and ability to expand to a public initiative wherein other scientists could pay the same organization for screening their candidate gene. The USDA-ARS Grape Genetics Research Unit GGRU) is engaged in a wide variety of agriculturally important research projects where detailed knowledge of plant functional genomics is critical.  The identification of gene function by reverse genetics facilitates efforts in cultivar improvement. For GGRU's intended applications, it has been determined that TILLING, a molecular process by which a mutagenized population is screened for lesions in a specific candidate gene, is required. This service is for a base period of nine months plus three one year option periods. NOTE: The Government may multiply the Unit Price by the total number of additional requirements needed, i.e. if we need 9,215 targets, the Unit Price will be multiplied by 3 to get the total Amount.  Furthermore, the quantity of any line item may be increased in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217.7 within 60 days prior to the expiration of the contract performance period. SCHEDULE OF ITEMS -

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This synopsis is published pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205 (c), and is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  NOTE:  There is no additional information available for release at this time.  Verbal request for information will not be provided.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES is seeking information regarding the potential use of commercially available or conceptual air filtration technology suitable for use in gas turbine engine intake separator systems aboard either current or potential future amphibious air cushion vehicle.  Desirable attributes of filtration technology considered for naval applications include: high filtration efficiency (across the engine power range/associated air flow velocity); low pressure drop; compact/low volume requirement; light weight; high reliability and low maintenance requirements; low life cycle cost.    The operating env!  ironment is that of an amphibious air cushion vehicle in a salt and particulate laden atmosphere, thereby necessitating an intake separator system to separate bulk water, salt and particulates from the intake air flow.  This is not a solicitation/RFP and there are no known future requirements pending at this time.  Any information (physical and performance characteristics, illustrations/drawings, commercial applications, operating experience, development/production status, space and weight requirements, discussion on suitability for use in naval applications, approximate cost and availability, etc.) submitted relative to this request for information should be forwarded to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES, 5001 S. Broad St., Code 985, Attn: Joseph Schell, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403 within 30 days of this announcement date.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA, is requesting information from industry regarding the engineering, production, installation, testing, and integrated logistics support leading to the delivery of an Embedded Platform Logistics System (EPLS).  EPLS will use a combination of onboard sensors, processors, user interfaces and transmitters to monitor continuously and collect, process, store, transmit, and display platform logistics status. Initially, this data will be processed at the platform and displayed to vehicle operators. Maintainers, using either a wireless reader or hardwire interface to a portable maintenance aid, will be able to download and read this same data upon indication that the vehicle is operating outside it’s prescribed performance parameters or there is an indication of an impending or actual fault. This will enable real-time exchange with the Command and Control (C2) and Logistics Enterprises, namely Global Command and Control System (GCCS) a!  nd Global Combat Service Support System – Marine Corps (GCSS-MC).  Application: EPLS will provide the capability to measure and monitor platform health and function leading to enhanced logistics support, war fighting readiness decision support, and situational awareness. EPLS will collect, process, display, store, and transmit information on platform operational status. Information will be collected on items such as platform power train and chassis, fuel supply, ammunition supply, weapon system condition, and mobile loads.  EPLS will also contain the platform maintenance history and technical reference specifications.  EPLS will be installed on the following platforms: the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), and the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV).  EPLS will enhance the following:  visibility of real time platform operating status; vehicle operators’ cognitive decision support, access to platform records, technical data and maintenance schedules, data entry to update platform records, and automated data exchange with portable maintenance devices. These devices automate the process of generating repair orders and repair-part inventory requests, interface in real time with technicians in other echelons, communicate system health and repair status, and enable maintenance history and technical reference specification viewing at the point of repair on the platform. Related Services: In addition to delivery of the EPLS, services for platform installation, engineering studies, configuration management, and contractor logistical support may be required. Responses:   A strong demonstration of corporate knowledge of manufacturing devices that measure, monitor, display, store, transmit, and collect data is required.  Firms capable of accomplishing the required services in whole, or by teamed effort, are invited to submit an affirmative response to this notice.  Partial solutions should not be submitted.  Firms should include literature, brochures, specification sheets, prior experience in this type of effort, and capability summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  Responses shall be limited to 15 pages for the technical information.  Potential sources are requested to send a letter of interest, previous business experience with similar efforts, business size and a corporate point of contact to: Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Quentin W. Blanchard, Contracts Directorate, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  FedEx or UPS deliveries should be sent to: Commanding Genera!  l, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2201A Willis Street, Attn: Quentin W. Blanchard, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  Materials submitted will not be returned.   This is not a request for quotation or proposal.  No solicitation document exists.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information from government, academia, and industry sources regarding novel solutions for the tanker protective system.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced Self Sealing Coupons to prevent leakage from tanker assets after ballistic impact from 0.50 caliber AP projectile impacting at 100 ft/s above muzzle velocity. The intention of the self sealing concept is that a material may be applied externally to a steel vessel containing a liquid. After an impact due to a 0.50 Cal. AP bullet where the bullet makes a complete penetration, the self-sealing material will close the entrance hole and either prevent or greatly reduce liquid spillage. A dependence on performance vs. temperature will also be studied. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.

NIDDK will be seeking an organization or an institution to serve as a Type 1 Diabetes Mouse Resource that will be responsible for importing, archiving and distributing unique mouse strains that are important for research in Type 1 Diabetes and its complications. The contractor will also be responsible for providing mouse production and distribution services to support NIDDK’s Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC).
The Type 1 Diabetes Mouse Resource (T1DR) will be designed to provide two core activities to support T1D translational research. 
•	The Repository Core (T1DR-RC) will be responsible for archiving and distributing unique animal models that are critical tools for translating T1D-relevant research from the laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside. A T1D mouse repository was initiated as part of the T1D Resource project in 2001, and was funded as a supplement to the NCRR-sponsored Induced Mutant Resource housed at the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbor, ME (http://www.jax.org/t1dr/). To date, nearly 150 mouse strains that are important for advancing T1D research have been archived and distributed via the Type 1 Diabetes Resource. This procurement intends to extend support for the existing Type 1 Diabetes Resource in its continuing mission to archive and distribute mouse strains that are important for advancing T1D research.
In its continuation phase, the scope of the T1DR will be expanded to include one additional core:
A Mouse Generation and Husbandry Core (T1DR-MGHC) that will provide support for production, maintenance, distribution, and phenotyping of new mouse models for the NIDDK Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC; www.amdcc.org).  

In addition, the contractor must have available on-site laboratory space, analytical equipment, AAALAC accredited animal quarters, bioinformatics, and computer resources to execute the various functions of the project.

This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a corporate capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.     All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.    

Interested firms responding to this sources sought should adhere to the following:

(a)	Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

(b)	The capability statement should include references, key personnel, and any teaming arrangements needed to fulfill the requirements.

(c)	All capability statements must be submitted in writing to the address identified in this synopsis on April 24, 2006 no later than 3:00pm eastern standard time. Responses will not be accepted via email or fax.

<SUBJECT>Y--POINT CAMPGROUND RECONSTRUCTION ON THE SAWTOOTH NATIONAL FOREST-PRE-BID TOUR NOTICE
<DESC>POINT CAMPGROUND RECONSTRUCTION ON THE SAWTOOTH NATIONAL FOREST, PRE-BID TOUR NOTICE. This announcement is to provide notice of a pre-bid tour scheduled for the Point Campground Reconstruction Project. Point Campground is part of the Redfish Lake Complex located approximately 5 miles south of Stanley, Idaho. It is anticipated that the contract solicitation will be advertised in March or April of 2007, the contract will be awarded in May, and work could start as soon as ground conditions allow, probably around the first of June. Since this high elevation site will be snow covered in March and April, prospective bidders are encouraged to visit the site this fall to familiarize themselves with the site conditions and other factors which may influence the work. Point Campground is located at the end of the road approximately 1000 ft. due south of Redfish Lake Lodge. The site consists of two campsite loops containing a total of 17 campsites, a loop for day-use parking and access to a swimming beach, and a lakeside trail. Most of the campsite amenities were constructed in 1966 with some upgrades performed in the 1970's. Depending on available funding, contract work may include the following: removal, breakdown and incorporation into the base of the existing double chip-seal BST surfacing from all roads, spurs and parking areas, estimated at approximately 7500 square yards; construction of new BST or asphalt surfacing on all roads, spurs and parking areas; widening or lengthening eight spurs to accommodate two vehicles; demolition and removal of the existing cinderblock and wood frame six-unit flush toilet building, sidewalks and adjoining changing rooms consisting of a concrete pad with wooden partitions; site prep for the installation of a new prefabricated concrete four or six-unit flush toilet building; construction of sidewalks around the new building; site prep for the installation of a new prefabricated concrete one-unit vault toilet near the beach parking area; reconstruction and possible relocation of family camp units including removal of BST surfacing, cedar bender-board retainers, concrete tables with in-ground footings, and steel fire rings and replacement with new items, most likely a fine graded gravel surfacing, cedar bender-board retainers, surface mounted tables and new fire rings; removal of the existing potable water, irrigation water and electric lines which are located in a common trench through much of the area; relocation and installation of new potable water, irrigation water and electric lines and associated valves, hydrants, sprinklers, and panel connections; removal and replacement of gates and dumpster pads; reconstruction of the existing approximately 1800 ft. long lakeside trail including removal of existing BST surfacing, relocation of short sections of trail, installation of sections of native rock retaining wall, and construction of a new hardened surface; and the installation of a new floating boat dock including construction of anchorage points. The campground will be closed to allow for construction of the project. All work must be completed in one season, generally from the first of June to the end of September. NAICS code: 237990. Size Standard: $28.5 Million. Estimated price range is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The pre-bid tour will be held at noon on Tuesday, Oct 10, 2006. Meet at the old check-in station area located adjacent to the Redfish Lake Road, approximately 500 ft. from the intersection with Hwy 75.

<SUBJECT>B -- Intent to Sole Source Rail Tracking Info System and Database
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACT. Pursuant to the authority of TSA Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS) guidance 3.2.2.4  Single-Source Selection, TSA intends to award a contract to IntelliTrans, a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCore, to modify proprietary IntelliTrans algorithmically-based statistical software tools to collect and analyze Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) tank car movement in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA), and populate a database with that information.  The database will focus on the standstill time of TIH cars in the HTUAs including dwell time in yards, interchanges, terminals and lines of road.  The system will also provide alerts and notifications for excessive dwell times and projected excessive dwell times.  IntelliTrans tools include a Multi-Modal Tracking System (MMTS) that provides complete end-to-end monitoring and a Business Events Analytics Manager (BEAM) tool that provides deep diagnostic capabilities.  MMTS implements new technology to offer rapid response times when querying searches, reports or historical data, eliminating the need for database extracts, making the tracking system as close to real time as currently possible.  IntelliTrans can deliver and deploy the capabilities required by TSA as quickly as two weeks from the receipt of data.  As one of the largest users of rail event data, IntelliTrans is knowledgeable of industry data collection capabilities and quality issues.  An existing infrastructure between Railinc and IntelliTrans can be used to establish a TSA defined chemical list within Railincs existing RailSight system to feed raw event data directly to IntelliTrans? system.  Additionally, they have direct data connections to all the Class I railroads to provide a more complete picture.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A QUOTATION.  However, if a company has reason to believe that it can meet or exceed all the needs of TSA for this requirement, it may submit documentation to demonstrate that capability.  Responses are due not later than 12:00 Noon Eastern, Wednesday, September 27, 2006.  Responses received after this date/time are considered untimely and will not be further considered.  Any inquiries must be submitted in writing to the TSA Contracting Officer, via sandra.mclaughlin@dhs.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted or responded to.  The requirements determination related to this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient  detail to demonstrate the companys ability to meet the requirement.

Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. No other information is provided to support the use of other than full and open competition.  See detail in paragraphs (2) through (8) above.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K).  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for network security and compatibility, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer  (see attached specifications) and Hyundai  19” Monitor – part number B90A-K.   The Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor computer (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K) have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system.  The desire to maintain continuity of computing manufacturers supports GITM’s ability to maintain a standard image for use in deploying desktops worldwide. The Hewlett Packard dc7600 is the same computer already purchased and deployed to GITM customers for the Unclass Network. Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program.    To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the equipment must be a Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K) units and provided by an authorized reseller of Hewlett Packard and Hyundai products. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K) as a key component of the Department’s networking system.  Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program.    The 41 USC 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K). Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP/Compaq servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure support requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/MSO/MSP has identified the HP/Compaq DL 360 and 380 servers as key components of its hardware support infrastructure. Equipment listed above will be used to support continued testing and troubleshooting of production messaging systems that are critical to Department of State global communication.  Hardware standardization and configuration reduces maintenance costs because components can be reused among servers versus complete server replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet MSP’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s messaging systems and associated data hardware support infrastructure. The HP/Compaq DL 360 and DL 380 servers have undergone test and assessment evaluation for hardware infrastructure installation and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board

The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. ).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Dell/EMC E-CX3-40 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Dell/EMC E-CX3-40 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array is an enterprise level storage system.  This SAN Array was selected for it ability to handle heavy transaction procession, very high-speed large block data transfers, and compute-intensive applications.  According to the manufacturer, the Dell/EMC CX3-40 is an ideal consolidated storage solution for applications that require high-performance and large capacities that can be easily managed and is a good match for large databases, messaging, remote replication, or OLTP applications requiring enterprise storage reliability and performance.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Dell/EMC E-CX3-40 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array.  The requested Dell hardware equipment will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ out years support and maintenance agreements.   In addition, the CX3-40 can also interoperate with earlier-generation technologies, allowing use of existing SAN investments.  For ease of 24X7 operational maintenance, it's easier to cope with Dell hardware, rather than ghosting images of a variety of different machines from different manufacturers.   Initially, CA/CST/II chose Dell hardware because Dell provided the fast processors and robust machines that had low failure rates.   The Dell/EMC E-CX3-40 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array was selected for this purpose.  Results obtained by the Bureau’s Visa Support Systems Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Dell/EMC E-CX3-40 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array without delay.

The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. ).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Dell/EMC E-CX3-20 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Dell/EMC E-CX3-20 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array is a mid-level storage system.  This SAN Array was selected for it ability to handle moderate-to-heavy transaction processing, high-speed large block data transfers, and departmental applications.  According to the manufacturer, the Dell/EMC CX3-20 array is a fully-integrated 4 Gigabit storage solution with four front-end Fibre Channel 4 optical ports and up to 120 2 or 4-Gigabit back-end disk drives. The CX3-20 offers all of the same enterprise features and software support of the larger CX3-40 and CX3-80 including enterprise business continuance capabilities; however, the CX3-20 is designed for more price-sensitive users who do not need all the performance and scalability that the CX3-40 and CX3-80 offer. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Dell/EMC E-CX3-20 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array.  The requested Dell hardware equipment will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ out years support and maintenance agreements.   In addition, the CX3-20 can also interoperate with earlier-generation technologies, allowing use of existing SAN investments.  For ease of 24X7 operational maintenance, it's easier to cope with Dell hardware, rather than ghosting images of a variety of different machines from different manufacturers.   Initially, CA/CST/II chose Dell hardware because Dell provided the fast processors and robust machines that had low failure rates.   The Dell/EMC E-CX3-20 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array was selected for this purpose.  Results obtained by the Bureau’s Visa Support Systems Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Dell/EMC E-CX3-20 SAN Fibre Channel RAID Array without delay.

The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL360 G5 and HP DL380 have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The servers required for the following projects must have RAID configuration utility compatible with existing systems so that no new user training is required: •	Telecom •	QA and Contingency •	iCLASS Contingency The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers meet this stipulation.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: RM/DCFO/GFMS requires an expansion to its existing development environment in Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased amount of development required to support the implementation of GFMS.  All of this equipment and software would be housed in the SDM development network and integrated with the existing development labs in Charleston and SA15.  RM/DCFO/GFMS/SDM must support Charleston and Washington based development activities in a consolidated network. As a result, each layer of the network’s technical architecture has been designed with high availability and redundancy in mind. Identical workstations, software, software development tools, printers, switches and monitors are fully configured to be utilized and to backup other similar equipment in the event of hardware failure. Likewise, each layer of the architecture must work seamlessly with itself. This means that a network equipment component layer must be not only compatible, but have the same performance, and operations characteristics so as not to introduce performance anomalies.  Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in HP printer technology. HP printers are used by State and USAID for the current production operations throughout SA15 and the Charleston Financial Center. CISCO switches are deployed throughout the Department’s network. Charleston has standardized its multi-hundred workstations on the Think Centre model. Microsoft desktop software is the Departmental standard. TOAD is the tool currently in use by SDM developers when developing systems using the Oracle database. WISE installation software is used for all current post level deployment packages by SDM. Charleston data center racks currently have 8 port HP switches and need to be expanded to their compatible 16 port configuration. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The RM bureau also has an extensive installed base of development software, workstations, switches and printers. Previous bulk orders for parts, cables, and toner cartridges for this equipment allow SDM to leverage there existing equipment inventory in an efficient manner. In addition, common maintenance can be performed by network technicians. To introduce additional supply inventories would defeat the savings achieved through these bulk orders. HP printers, CISCO switches, Microsoft and TOAD development software, Think Centre workstations and Samsung monitors are available on a number of GSA schedules.  Based on the current production installed base of this equipment and software and the critical need for the GFMS to stay consistent with their network configurations, RM recommends the acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of this software and equipment for our development network.

This procurement will replace HR's current BIG-IP v4.5 devices with the V9.x devices.  The 9.x devices offers several advantages such as all solid state memory, two CPUs and expansion modules not available on the v4.5 platform as well as an improved rules engine. Also included is an IPv6 module that will allow the BIGIP to understand both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  IPv6 is being implemented. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501), as implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  The addition of the implementation service will enable the Bureau of Human Resources to correctly configure and implement the already purchased and maintained equipment into our production environment.  In addition the use of Dell as the service provider will ensure that the Bureau meets the manufactures best practices and that the configuration conforms to a supported model. This OEM manufacturer offers expertise that no other known or discovered vendor can offer and the inability to identify any other support vendor capable of providing authorized and certified support for the Big-IP.  Our large investment in Dell servers and their Big-IP appliances and technology requires the Bureau to implement and support the products to the highest possible levels. There will be no barriers to future competition.  Any future requirements will be evaluated on their own merit and, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be procured using full and open competition procedures

5.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AUTHORITY:
Clearcube brand blades have the form, fit, and function required to operate the Clearcube rack systems that the SOJICC uses, and no other blade servers or blade computers will fit in the existing Clearcube racks.  Furthermore, Clearcube manufacturers the only blade computers accredited for use in SOJICC and SOCOM supports Clearcube blade computers.
 
Dell workstations are considered the SOCOM (Special Operations Command) standard, and SOCOM does not support any other brand of workstations.  Through SOCOM?s Help Desk, the SOJICC Program has access to Dell replenishment spares, and can swap parts/conduct onsite repairs within a matter of hours.  Dell is the only brand of workstations accredited by SOCOM.

If any other brands of computer blades or workstations are used, the overall life cycle cost (for maintenance, repairs, and training) will be higher due to support complexity and new training requirements (for repairing the equipment).

PART 1.  GENERAL

1.1  GENERAL CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
  
General Overview:  This procurement will result in the award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract.  The project can be broken into three main components; historic mitigation, landscape repairs, and restoration of various nature trails.  

The historic mitigation is part of an effort by the Navy to develop a historical interpretative program to increase awareness and appreciation of the historic and archaeological resources within NAS Pensacola and, in particular, the significant developments in Naval warfare represented by the historic properties that are or were located within the Nation Historic Landmark District.  The program shall have a focus on interpreting the history of Naval Aviation and of NAS Pensacola for military personnel and the public, through the use of such means as interpretive displays and signage.  To that end, the project will provide a minimum of three new pedestrian plazas containing wayside exhibits and focal static exhibits, lighted walkways/sidewalks, and other site improvements and incidental related work in the vicinity of and along the existing seawall walkway on NAS Pensacola.  All new improvements shall complement and commemorate the National Historic Landmark District.  Two of the plazas shall be able to seat a minimum of 15 people, while a third larger plaza will be able to seat a minimum of 50 people.  The larger plaza shall also provide space to accommodate at least 200 persons for special events.  Development of the plazas, wayside exhibits and monuments shall require consultation with the Florida State Historic Preservation Officer, coordinated through the Navy.  The contractor shall provide bronze, granite, or other appropriate material for wayside exhibits and placards.  The inscribed or cast text and graphics on the wayside exhibits and placards will be approved by the Navy.  The project, where appropriate, will incorporate historic features such as the Building 47 smoke stack, terracotta rosettes, and other salvaged elements/artifacts from other historic buildings that have been demolished.  All work performed will be in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, and implementing regulations under 36 CFR Part 800; the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (STANDARDS); and other applicable Federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidance documents

The project will re-establish the landscape and grounds on NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, NTTC Corry Station and Saufley Field to robust, context appropriate, pre-Hurricane Ivan state, including, but not limited to, the removal of trees that have been damaged to the point that they are no longer viable, the removal of stumps and snags, the removal of vegetative debris, and provision of needed restoration of the vegetative landscaping (including, but not be limited to, trees, shrubs, and groundcovers) that was adversely affected by recent hurricanes throughout the activities.  Areas to be restored will include, but not limited to, roads, more formal areas, and undeveloped areas.  New vegetation shall be maintained and guaranteed for a period of one year after the final acceptance of the project.

Additionally, at NAS Pensacola the project will repair the Trout Point Nature Trail (an ADA compliant boardwalk), repair and/or replace Osprey nesting platforms, repair the Bayou Grande Nature Trail, and repair the Lake Frederic Fishing Area.  Also included are repairs to the Saufley Field Nature Trail and Fishing Boardwalk and the NAS Whiting Field Clear Creek Nature Trail.

Base Contract

?  Protective Storage - Convenient storage box provides protection for the digital panel and grid adapter when not in use or during transportation. 
The SR-130D system has an integrated touch screen computer with integral keyboard for selecting Anatomical Programming or manual selection of x-ray techniques. It also provides the ability to export study lists to PACS systems for clinical history and follow-up exams. The SR-130D is DICOM 3 compatible.
?  Easy Data Entry - Enter patient data using convenient touch screen panel. 
?  Anatomical Programming - Select Anatomical Region of interest. Then Anatomical View. 
?  Fast Results - View Image immediately. Magnify or Enhance image

with on-board tools. 
?  Manual Over-Ride - Over-Ride any pre-programmed technique easily and quickly.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90D-K).  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for network security and compatibility, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer  (see attached specifications) and Hyundai  19” Monitor – part number B90D-K.   The Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor computer (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90D-K) have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system.  The desire to maintain continuity of computing manufacturers supports GITM’s ability to maintain a standard image for use in deploying desktops worldwide. The Hewlett Packard dc7600 is the same computer already purchased and deployed to GITM customers for the Unclass Network. Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program.    To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the equipment must be a Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90D-K) units and provided by an authorized reseller of Hewlett Packard and Hyundai products. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90A-K) as a key component of the Department’s networking system.  Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program.    The 41 USC 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Hewlett Packard dc7600 Small Form Factor Computer, (see attached specifications) and Hyundai 19-inch (part number B90D-K). Use of another brand will create the need for supporting multiple computing hardware needs as well as drive the creation and maintenance of additional computing images. This action will result in additional cost and significant time delays to the GITM program. CHANGED PART # IN BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION TO B90D-K FOR MONITOR.

The HP/Compaq DL 360 and DL 380 servers have undergone test and assessment evaluation for hardware infrastructure installation and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.    The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Secure Computing products as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm.  The equipment listed above is required to support the system expansion and future growth of the ONE program.  The Secure Computing FOB devices allow two factor authentications when accessing the ONE servers from remote locations. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s ONE networking infrastructure.

Questions and Answers
25 September 2006
Question 1:  How can this be a Brand name solicitation?  What item are you specifying has to be Brand name? 
Response 1:  The solicitation is identified as Brand Name or Equal because the item being purchased is a kit identified by a vendor Part Number.
Question 2: You state "Narcotic"/Military Working Dog kit?  There is no K-9 Narcotic items 
listed.  Is there some item we are missing here?  This is the Air Force Security Forces UTC: QFEBR.  It is a LOGDET to support all types of different certified dogs not just Narcotic dogs.  So is there something missing here or is that just a word mis-association?  
Response 2:  The Kit identified is the same kit used for both Narcotic and Military Working Dogs.  There are no additional items included in the kit specifically for ?Narcotic? working dogs.   
Question 3:  The items you list do not make up a complete QFEBR.  So are we to assume
this is a modified QFEBR and only quote the total price of the items you list here?
Response 3:  The items listed in the synopsis/solicitation are identified as Required Characteristics.  The product being offered must include these characteristics to qualify as brand name or equal to the QFEBR Working Dog Kit offered as Garrett Container Systems Part Number CON 961140X.  The complete list of items for Part Number CON 961140X is identified below, to include a breakout of the items for subkits.   
Question 4:  SF Logdet has two expandable tents for the QFEBR. The BaseX and the Darnell. Which tent does the customer want?  
Response 4:  Base X
Question 5:  PAQ-4C Laser Aiming light is no longer manufactured. The other light is the PEC-2A which is considerably more expensive. If any one sells the PAC-4C to the military now because they have them on their shelve it is wrong. You will not be able to get them repaired, plus it is old technology. Is the PEC-2A acceptable?   
Response 5:  PEC-2A is acceptable
Question 6:  What size collapsible dog container? There are two sizes the SF world uses. This item is not on the SF QFEBR so it must be an addition here.  
Response 6:  Size is 48 by 28 x 26 and is collapsible.

Scope of Work
Professional Services 
Industry Audience Usability Testing of CDRH Website


I.Background

FDA?s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) regulates medical devices and radiation-emitting products.  It is expensive and time-consuming for the medical device industry to comply with FDA?s laws and regulations.  And it takes a great deal of FDA time and resources to guide industry through these processes.  

The CDRH website (www.fda.gov/cdrh) contains all of the documents we have available to help industry bring new products to market and ensure postmarket safety.  But it is sometimes difficult for users to navigate through the website in order to find the specific documents they need.

The purpose of this contract is to assess the CDRH website from the perspective of regulated industry in order to help set the requirements for designing a user-friendly site. Redesigning the CDRH website will save time and money by making it easier for companies to find, understand and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

7)Receive all reports and videotapes from the contractor;


C.Project Officer

The Project Officer will be Laurel Mendelson.  The Project Officer will be responsible for interacting with the contractor to accomplish the terms of the contract.

Q. What is the program office associated with this program?
A. Office of Communication, Education and Radiation Programs, Division of Device User Programs and Systems Analysis

A. There is no current incumbent.

Q. What is the estimated level of effort in hours?
A. The hours depend on the project proposal, to include the following:  managing the project, attending meetings, developing materials, pilot-testing questions, conducting sessions, analyzing data, writing report.		

Q. Will travel be required to conduct interviews?
A. It depends on the project proposal.  Remote testing sessions could be acceptable if the contractor can demonstrate experience and competence in this method. 

Q. Is the usability tool to be created by the contractor an automated tool or just a moderator?s guide for the web usage?
A. The usability tool is the moderator's guide combined with the method proposed to conduct the actual testing.  This could be automated or non-automated.

Q. Are usability tests required for both FDA internal users and vendor users?
A. The usability testing will be conducted on actual representatives from regulated industry only.

Q. Is the deliverable testing script the same as the moderator?s guide?
A. Yes.

Q. Is the activity in section 2)B. going to be done by the FDA representative or is this activity done by the contractor? It currently reads like these are FDA driven activities and if so they that would impact contractor deliverables.
A. Yes, the section IIB states "The FDA, in the person of the project officer or her designee, will perform the following tasks:"  These tasks will be completed by the FDA representatives who will be responsible for interacting with the contractor to accomplish the terms of the contract.  Each of these tasks will influence the contractor's deliverables.

Q. In section II.A.1.f there is mention of two rounds of usability testing with 8 ? 9 users in each round. In section IV and V.D there is mention of a written report (singular). Is the intent that the two rounds will take place concurrently, or at least around the same time, or will they be separated by substantial time? If separated, is there a need for a report after each round, or only one report after both rounds have been completed? 
A. The 2 rounds of usability testing can take place around the same time.  We are proposing 2 different rounds rather than one larger round so that each can address a different subset of the audience or can contain more targeted questions

Q. Under Submission of Responses, the RFQ says the 10 page limit for the proposal does not include sample materials and personnel resumes. What sort of ?sample materials? are requested? Should costing be included in the 10 page limit, or should costs be submitted in a separate document? 
A. We are not requesting/requiring any specific sample materials.  However, if you would like to demonstrate your ability to conduct usability testing by submitting test scripts, reports, or company protocols, we would be happy to review them.  Your technical proposal should not exceed 10 pages, and you may submit your cost proposal as a separate document.

Q. Can you provide a ceiling price or ballpark price range that has been budgeted for this project? 
A.  We are not able to provide that information, please submit a brief description on your pricing for the necessary personnel, materials, services in support of this project.

Offers from other than Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns will not be considered. Section L.4.1. Tab F:  Cost/Price Proposal and Section M.4. Explanation of evaluation criteria both identify Cost/Price as a factor to be evaluated. Due to an administrative error the percentages for Cost/Price were shwon as 0 percent.

For any questions contact Tom Trivisani, 703-428-4575

<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided as Amendment 0001 to this Consolidated Synopsis/Solicitation.  The closing date and time remains unchanged.  No additional question will be accepted after 3PM MST on 26 September 2005. Q1.	What kind of bed will ultimately be installed on the chassis?  A1.	We will eventually be having a bed specially built which will be a flat type of bed. Once we get the truck and the Generator (not part of this purchase) for it we will get a bed built for it to mount a 10 kw Generater and a 5th wheel hitch. Q2.	What color of interior?  A2.	On the interior it really does not matter. Q3.	Is power windows/locks required? A3.	This was not on our salient characteristics. But if is part of a standard package this must be included in the price. Q4.	What warranty is required?  3-year /36,000 standard? A4.	Standard Manufacturer's warranty.
