ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A CAPABILITY STATEMENT, PROPOSAL, OR QUOTATION, WHICH SHALL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. A CONTRACT AWARD TO ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE ELIMINATES SUBSTANTIAL DUPLICATION OF COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED THROUGH COMPETITION BECAUSE THIS IS THE FINAL YEAR OF THIS EFFORT. THE LAST PLANNED FIELDING WILL TAKE PLACE IN AUGUST 2014 ENDING THE EFFORT. Z-SYSTEMS CURRENTLY HAS A 80,000 SQUARE FOOT SECURED WAREHOUSE BY FOOT HOOD, TEXAS CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 2,049 LINE ITEMS OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED ASSETS AT AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $36 MILLION.  COST TO TRANSFER THESE ASSETS TO ANOTHER FACILITY NEAR FORT HOOD, TEXAS AND TO START-UP TOTAL PACKAGE FIELDING FROM THIS NEW FACILITY WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED FROM COMPETITION.  THE IMPACT OF NOT CONTINUING THIS EFFORT WITH ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE WOULD BE WORK STOPPAGES AND DEGRADATION OF MISSION IN FULFILLING THE AGENCY?S REQUIREMENTS.  THE ARMY WOULD NOT MEET ITS OPERATIONAL READINESS IF VEHICLES WERE RECEIVED WITHOUT ALL THE BII NEEDED BY OPERATOR AND CREWS TO MAINTAIN THE VEHICLES.   AWARDING A CONTRACT TO Z SYSTEMS, INC. ELIMINATES DUPLICATIVE COSTS, ENSURES THERE IS NO BREAK IN SERVICE AND AVOIDS COSTS A NEW CONTRACTOR WOULD INCUR TO ACQUIRE OR LEASE A WAREHOUSE FACILITY FOR ONLY ONE YEAR.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for conducting acquisitions in support of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH has a requirement for a contractor to provide facility electrical utility analysis, hazard labeling, identify Personal Protective Equipment requirements, and to enable employee safety training to meet OSHA requirements for potential work place electrical exposure hazards for accessible energized systems.<br /><br />This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition after exclusion of sources basis (set-aside for small business concerns).<br /><br />The complete requirement details will be contained within a solicitation document which is anticipated to be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov between 15 to 30 calendar days after the posting date of this notice. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site.<br /><br />REQUIREMENT SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />The study will consist of an audit of the whole facility electrical infrastructure beginning at the incoming utility company power supply located at the two facility electrical substations, and following down the line to each building for individual local power panels, transformers, switchgear, motor control centers and connected electrical devices.<br /><br />A qualified electrical engineering consultant will be contracted to provide field personnel to inspect and record "as-built" system component data, perform technical analysis of the whole system and prepare a report. Information from the survey will be utilized to update facility electrical single line drawings and diagrams. Computer modeling will be conducted to determine system performance parameters for various components that may have field accessible points potentially exposing personnel to live powered circuits for maintenance activities or other physical access requirements.<br /><br />The facility study evaluation of the electrical system will include; Arcing Short Circuit Calculations, Time Current Curve Evaluations, Incident Energy Calculations, and Flash Protection Boundary Calculations. Upon completion of the analysis, the engineering consultants will provide a report for the NIOSH Pittsburgh systems detailing the results. The work will be performed in compliance with the requirements and procedures set-forth in the National Fire Protection Association's 70 &amp; 70E National Electric Codes, IEEE article 1584 and various applicable ANSI standards for conducting electrical studies and analysis.

<DESC>The Family and Cancer Treatment Selection (FACTS) follow-up study began in 2011 and was developed to evaluate the long-term impacts of cancer treatment on perceptions of care, the relationship between the prostate cancer survivor and his partner, and the relationship of the couple with the health care system by re-contacting participants of the original FACTS study.&nbsp; The contractor who conducted the original FACTS study was the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and they have also conducted the first two years of the current study (follow-up study).&nbsp; They are the only entity who can complete the latest phase of the study that has been underway since 2011.&nbsp; Consequently, it is believed that the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the above mentioned requirements of CDC.&nbsp; It is the intent of CDC to award a contract to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center if this is found to be true.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure services on a sole source basis with Sarawak Hospice Society, Jalan Hospital, Kuching 93586, Sarawak, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard in $14.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be from August 31, 2013 - August 30, 2014.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that associations with breast cancer risk factors vary by tumor pathology. Asian women seem to have a distinctive profile of breast cancer that differs from that seen in Western populations, such as earlier age at onset, more advanced stage, and higher frequency of ER-negative tumors. Large, population-based epidemiologic studies of characterizing molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Asian women are limited. Given that Asian breast cancer is associated with early age-onset and aggressive tumors, it is speculated that the prevalence of TN/basal tumors in Asian women may be higher than Caucasians.</p>
<p>Recently, Sarawak Hospice Society compared the distribution of breast cancer subtypes in the three ethnic groups (Chinese, Natives, and Malays) in Sarawak, Malaysia and found that Malays and Natives were more likely to develop TN tumors compared to Chinese despite of the overall lower incidence rates. These findings suggest that breast cancer subtypes may vary by ethnicity in Asian populations and it is likely that both genetic and environmental exposures may jointly contribute to the association between a specific subtype and a particular ethnic group. Tumor stratification in afore mentioned studies was all based on three markers only, ER, PR, and HER2, without separation of basal from TN tumors. A more refined molecular classification approach is needed to achieve finer and more accurate tumor stratification and to identify etiologic factors underlying a specific tumor subtype, which will be helpful in developing risk models for specific types of breast cancer and therefore improving targeted screening and prevention in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to classify breast tumors into molecular subtypes and to identify distinct risk factors for each subtype in Malaysian women diagnosed at Sarawak General Hospital (SGH). The specific aim for this procurement is to recruit breast cancer patients to participate in the pilot study and retrieve clinical and medical data and biospecimens that are collected and stored by SGH.</p>
<p>Sarawak Hospice Society is uniquely qualified to perform this work for the following reasons: 1) the goal of this study is to identify breast cancer subtypes in a unique Asian population with different ethnicity groups. Residents in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, come from three main ethnic groups: Natives (50%), Malays (25%), and Chinese (25%). The three races have maintained their distinct cultures, reproductive practices and diets, with very few intermarriages. Previous work by Sarawak Hospice Society's group showed that the distribution of breast cancer subtypes varied across these ethnicity groups, providing a unique resource to address NCI's research questions; 2) Sarawak Hospice Society is affiliated with Sarawak General Hospital (SGH). SGH is the only cancer centre in Sarawak and treats 93% of the breast cancer patients in Sarawak (Devi CR, Int J Cancer, 2012). Breast cancer patients will be recruited from that hospital; no commercial company would have access to these patients; and 3) the current study is an extension and expansion of previous work that was done by Sarawak Hospice Society, by increasing the number of breast cancer cases and conducting a detailed molecular profiling analysis. NCI will take advantage of the established infrastructure instead of initiating a completely new study.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, particularly small businesses; they should submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 25, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Laura Glockner, Contract Specialist at laura.glockner@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through SAM.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130057-LG on all correspondence.</p>

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT), Newport, Rhode Island intends to purchase a vessel for the Narragansett Bay Shallow Water Test Facility (NBSWTF) a NUWCDIVNPT test and evaluation facility that offers a variety of unique shallow water test environments that permits prototype undersea systems to be exposed to real environments with a minimum risk of loss.
  NBSWTF supports all of the NUWC product lines with its waterfront facilities, underwater tracking, search, and location capabilities, and various vessels.  The vessels vary in size from the 120-foot TWR-841 down to a 17-foot Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB).  The next largest boat to the TWR-841 is the 35-foot long WB-30.  Due to the higher cost of operation of the TWR-841, and the limitation in capabilities of the WB-30, a need has been identified by NUWCDIVNPT for the facility to operate a vessel between these two vessels in size and capability.  This facility is designed to support work in advanced underwater weapons and weapons systems, launcher systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, oceanographic systems, acoustic communications, and oceanography.

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511 which has a corresponding Size standard 750 employees. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hub-zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code if applicable. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers within the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work that will be accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.</p>
<p>2. Program Details:</p>
<p>2.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. AFLCMC/WWMPA F-16 Integration Section, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a contract to upgrade the existing F-16 Block 25/30/32 Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (EGI) and GPS Antenna Electronics (AE) unit to allow anti-jamming and anti-spoofing functions. The intent is to provide these capabilities without a change to the EGI electronics/OFP other than the GPS card. This capability is also required with no other aircraft software changes. This functionality is also required with no aircraft wiring (Group A) change. Digital communication between the AE unit and GPS card is required to be maintained through the existing F-16 block 30 wiring. This action is being conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the following:</p>
<p>a. The GPS card is required to perform within the EGI without any other (Non-GPS card) EGI hardware or software changes.<br />b. The GPS AE unit is required to be a form and fit replacement to the existing GPS AE GAS-1 or AE-1 unit.<br />c. To avoid new integration requirements, all GPS/EGI card proposals will need to match existing GEMII hardware/software interface to the F-16 Block 30 Honeywell H764G EGI. <br />d.

<DESC> <br> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br> High Pressure Hose for Theater Bulk Petroleum Distribution <br>  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI); MARKET SURVEY REQUEST IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL STUDY.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking Offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br>  <br> TOPIC:  <br> The U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to determine the level of interest among qualified Offerors to provide commercially available, high-pressure hose/conduit for distributing military fuels.  In the initial response to this RFI, the Government is requesting only the information requested under the  quote mark Responses quote mark  section below.   <br>  <br> After the initial responses are received to this RFI, the Government may request that sample product(s) be submitted by the Offeror.  If a sample product is requested by TARDEC, Offerors shall submit the requested number of samples within six (6) weeks of the request.   TARDEC is considering whether to formally solicit for up to 5 miles of high pressure, flexible, lay-flat, conduit for use in evaluating early entry petroleum distribution design concepts.  The intent of this RFI is to identify already available products, and NOT to identify products currently under development.  <br>  <br>  <br> REQUESTED TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONALITY:  <br>  <br> The high-pressure hose/conduit shall meet the following criteria:  <br> 1. Candidate hoses shall be currently marketed for and have existing commercial uses.   <br>  <br> 2. Candidate hoses shall be part of an overall petroleum distribution system that consists of deployment and retrieval hose reel devices, high pressure pumps, hose evacuation components (pig launcher and receiver using compressed air), gap crossing equipment (suspension bridges, culverts, etc), and command and control equipment. <br>  <br> 3. The candidate hoses shall be capable of being included in a distribution system capable of transporting 850,000 gallons of fuel per day, over a 50 mile distance, while experiencing significant elevation changes (see terrain profile below, at the bottom of this RFI).  <br>  <br> 4. Candidate hoses should be capable of transporting 800 gallons per minute of military grade diesel fuel, over unimproved road networks, and under environmental conditions, as defined in MIL-STD-810G.  (A copy of this military standard is available here: <br> http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/FEDMIL/std810g.pdf) <br>  <br> 5. Candidate hoses shall be 5-in diameter or greater, be available in continuous segments between 400-700 feet in length, include quick disconnect fittings on both ends of the hose, rated for the working pressure, and have working pressures above 200 psi.   Candidate hoses shall be capable of spooling onto a hose reel system such that approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet of hose can be placed on an individual hose reel.   <br>  <br> 6. Candidate hoses shall be capable of being stored on a hose reel inside standard International Standards Organization (ISO) containers.  The hose shall be deployed and retrieved from some form of a hose reel system that is mounted on the bed of a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck Load Handling System (HEMTT-LHS).  Typical deployment of the hose during operation is alongside Main Supply Route, roads, and populated areas; therefore, it is imperative the hose shall not migrate or move from the original placement (minimal elongation properties).  The operational concept includes missions of various durations (6 weeks to 1 year).  A mission can also incorporate multiple hose deployments and retrievals from the hose reel. <br>  <br> 7. Candidate hose shall meet the performance specifications of MIL-PRF-370, Revision J, Hose and Hose Assemblies, Nonmetallic: Elastomeric Liquid Fuel.  (A copy of this military performance specification is available here: <br> http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/FEDMIL/prf370j.pdf) <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSES:   <br>  <br> Each initial response to this RFI is requested to include: <br>  <br> 1. A brief (no more than one page) company description, summarizing the organization's history, and pertinent industry experience. <br>  <br> 2. An executive summary (no more than one page) of the information submitted in reply to this Request for Information. <br>  <br> 3.

All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified and properly marked. <br>  <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION: <br>  <br> The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark confidential quote mark  under this statute.  [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term  quote mark confidential quote mark  in the context of Classified Information, quote mark  we will use the term  quote mark PROPRIETARY. quote mark ] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:     <br>  <br> 1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.  <br>  <br> 2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (excessive breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting, or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br>  <br> 3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.  <br>  <br> 4.  Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> 5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>  <br> 6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.  <br>  <br>  <br> GOVERNMENT POINTS OF CONTACT: <br>  <br> Technical POC:  Mr. Drew Downing, TARDEC, E-Mail: edward.a.downing.civ@mail.mil  <br>  <br> Contracting POC:  Ms. Angela Hernandez, Contract Specialist, E-Mail: angela.c.hernandez6.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>  <br> Terrain Profile  <br> See attachment <br>

<DESC> <br> 1.  Sources Sought.    The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC)-Fort Eustis, VA is seeking competition for flight training services at Fort Rucker, AL.  We have identified several impediments to competition and we seek industry input on possible approaches to overcoming the barriers.  First, the requirement requires significant initial investment in infrastructure.  The contractor must provide all aircraft, flight simulators, and real property facilities (hangars and classroom facilities, plus supporting equipment and material necessary to conduct the training for C-12 Aviator Qualification Course (AQC), C-12 Instructor Pilot Course (IPC) and C-12 Aviator Refresher Course (simulator only) for the U.S. Army Fixed Wing Training Courses.  The U.S. Army HQ for Aviation resides at Fort Rucker, AL.  The current incumbent contractor already has existing facilities and simulators.  Until now, the training aircraft, the C12s, have been supplied by the Army; however, in the future, the contractor must supply all training aircraft.  Secondly, the location is remote.  Available airports do exist in the area; however, class D airspace is required.  Thirdly, the period of performance contemplated is a five to ten year period of performance.  Input on the period of performance that would be necessary in order for your firm to compete for the requirement is requested, even if it is outside of the contemplated period.  The Army requests information in regards to which firms would be interested in competing for these services and input on possible solutions or ways to overcome the barriers to competition that currently exists.  If there are no interested parties other than the incumbent, the Army will seek to procure the services through a sole source vehicle.  We request a business case package in which a convincing argument is made as to your willingness to compete for the requirement, your capability to provide the services, and the feasibility to the U.S. Army as to any recommendations that you make to enhance the competitive nature of this action. <br>  <br> The services to be performed shall include personnel with the appropriate certificates and qualifications to instruct flight students to include current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificates as well as logged air time and personnel management with experience supervising fixed wing flight training.  The estimated annual student attendance consists of 180 students for the C-12 AQC, 64 students for the C-12 IPC and 216 students for the C-12 REF course.  The Government is looking for interested parties that are capable of providing training aid such as Stage I aircraft (single engine), Stage II aircraft (multi-engine) and Stage III aircraft (multi-engine turbine), as well as C-12V flight simulators, simulator training devices, the appropriate literature, schematics, drawing, charts, and facilities, etc., to conduct the fixed wing training.  All aircraft, maintenance facilities, etc. shall be provided by the contractor.  Your response shall address your ability to respond and service the required location and the requirement for class D airspace in accordance with PAA requirements which can be found at the following website:  http://www.faa.gov/air traffic/publications/atpubs/AIRlair1702.ptml).  <br>    <br> 2.  Background.  The United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE), 110TH Aviation Brigade, mission is to provide the Army with professionally trained aviators and non-rated crew members through planning, coordinating, and executing formal flight instruction at the undergraduate and graduate level.

Each battalion has a unique mission.  The brigade also provides crash rescue, air ambulance support to the USAACE and the surrounding communities, and serves as the Department of the Army Night Vision Device training and Operations staff agency.  The 110th has a diverse mission and continues to support the Army Aviation Branch by producing the world's best Army Aviators.  The objectives are to provide flight training and flight training support to execute the U.S. Army's fixed wing training courses; balanced training for all student pilots by preparing them for the field in  quote mark Go to War quote mark  aircraft; and strategic plans support for the Aviation Enterprise. <br>  <br> 3.  Technical/Functional Requirements.  The services to be performed shall include personnel with the appropriate certificates and qualifications to instruct flight students to include current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificates as well as logged air time and personnel management with experience supervising fixed wing flight training.  The estimated annual student attendance consists of 180 students for the C-12 AQC, 64 students for the C-12 IPC and 216 students for the C-12 REF course.

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity (DMA) Contracting Office is seeking sources to produce a United States Marine Corps' Digital Application. This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified companies capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is an announcement seeking market information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), the Government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP); however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g., large business, small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511 with a size standard of $25.5 million.
<p>A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached. The primary purpose of this notice is to: 1) collect information to assist the government in determining scope and feasibility, including but not limited to features, cost, and performance, 2) incorporate industry recommendations, 3) determine the availability and potential use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Products, 4) make any necessary adjustments to the SOW, 5) identify interested respondents - large businesses, small businesses, 8(a), Veteran Owned, etc., and to determine if competition is available and if a set-aside is warranted, 6) any other currently unknown use and benefit of non-proprietary information collected for its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements. Responses should speak to the ability to perform the requirements contained in the PWS and provide evidence of successful experience.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska   is seeking sources capable of performing the requirements necessary to provide co-location, support and maintenance of Sun Servers with associated software including the support of web based applications and internet connections to support the eLandings system. eLandings is part of a reporting system and details are available at http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/er/.  The Government contemplates the award of a contract with a one year base period and four one year option periods.  The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice. The contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, material, and labor necessary to perform the services.
<p>The Interagency Electronic Reporting System (IERS), more commonly known as eLandings, is an interagency project involving the three agencies that manage commercial fisheries in Alaska: Alaska Department of Fish and Game, National Marine Fisheries Service (AKR), and the International Pacific Halibut Commission.  Commercial seafood processors are required to report data on seafood harvest to these agencies. Since inception in 2005 eLandings has provided the Alaska fishing industry with a consolidated electronic means of reporting landings and production of commercial fish and shellfish to multiple management agencies.  The fishing industry in Alaska operates around-the-clock, with landings any day of the week and at any hour of the day. To accommodate industry eLandings requires 24x7 support and operations and must be highly available (99.9% availability is required.). Because eLandings is an interagency project and is not the exclusive responsibility of any one agency, support and operations must be situated such that responsibilities can be shared among the three agencies. High availability and shared maintenance and operations access across multiple agencies are not typical requirements for internal government data center facilities.</p>
<p>AKR is seeking professional services to support, co-locate and maintain components of the eLandings system for the eLandings interagency project.  AKR will be the customer for this contract; however, the other agencies remain involved, and it is understood where this document refers to AKR or AKR staff, it could potentially include all three agencies.</p>
<p>It should be recognized that supporting web-based applications in rural Alaska has unique challenges. Rural Alaska communities (where many fishery landings occur) are remote and isolated and internet connectivity is frequently via satellite-based circuits with limited bandwidth, and is sometimes affected by weather and/or Aurora Borealis activity. Experience has demonstrated that eLandings customers find it difficult to distinguish internet connectivity problems from eLandings application problems, and the contractor must be capable of supporting and diagnosing this issue. Historically this service has been provided by an Alaskan internet service provider.  However, this sources sought notice is not restricted and all contractors, especially small contractors, are encouraged to respond to this sources sought.</p>
<p>It should also be recognized that while the production aspect of this server environment has high availability requirements, a full capable non-production environment is included.  The identical non-production environment allows testing and understanding of any changes which may be needed to the production environment to be conducted with far less pressure or risk to the contractor, or customer.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1)	Customer support services (Minimum): Contractor shall provide a toll-free number and 24x7 staff to respond to eLandings customer support calls. Support staff will be familiar with Alaska geography, internet infrastructure, communities, fisheries, fishery management regimes, and fishery management agencies. Support staff will record customer requests for statistical purposes, will apply AKR-supplied resolution scripts to reach a resolution where possible, and will escalate calls that support staff cannot resolve to the contractor's systems engineers for service outages or to AKR staff for complex fisheries regulatory questions.  Response should demonstrate contractor's knowledge, ability, and experience supporting customer internet applications for customers in the top twenty eLandings landing ports, which are, in order of number of landings, Kodiak, Naknek, Dutch Harbor, Sitka, Sand Point, Akutan, Homer, King Cove, Quinhagak, St. Paul, Goodnews Bay, Seward, Cordova, Petersburg, Yakutat and Juneau.</p>
<p>2)	Co-location services (Minimum): Contractor shall provide rack space, power, environmental control, and internet for two sets of AKR servers, each set occupying up to a half rack, or approximately 21U of rack space, each requiring four gigabit and one 100 megabit Ethernet connections (exact rack requirements may depend somewhat on the co-location facility's service model, but within 21U there would be room for NOAA's  local network switch and power distribution units if necessary). Co-location services shall be consistent with industry standards for data center environments, including 24x7x365 on-site staffing, power conditioning, uninterruptable power, non-destructive fire suppression, cooling, network connectivity, physical security, and offsite disaster recovery contingency arrangements.</p>
<p>3)	Contractor shall provide all consultation, services, and labor to implement services described from delivery of servers at contractors data center facility. Juneau or Anchorage, Alaska is the preferred locations for the contractor's facility.  However, other locations may be considered.</p>
<p>4)	Server vendor support proxy (Minimum): Contractor shall be a proxy for AKR with respect to a support contract between AKR and hardware vendors supporting the two sets of servers and associated server system software.  AKR will maintain support contracts for hardware and system and database software.  Contractor will provide vendor support staff access as necessary to support the systems.  Contractor will receive support communiqu&eacute;s from hardware and database vendors and take appropriate action on behalf of AKR.</p>
<p>5)	Solaris and Oracle administration (Minimum): Contractor shall provide primary system administration services, consistent with industry norms.  Contractor shall provide specified AKR staff with "root equivalent" access to AKR servers, and contractor system administrators will maintain open dialog with AKR system administrators to manage and coordinate system administration activities.</p>
<p>The joint system administration model will generally consist of contractor resources maintaining and patching Solaris (minimum version 5.10) and Oracle (minimum version 11.2.0.3.0), and AKR resources maintaining applications and configuring Solaris and Oracle to best support those applications.  Generally contractor resources will be expected to exercise their own judgment in applying patches or making other changes on the non-production server, and then notify AKR, specifying the changes that have been made and should be evaluated, and later with concurrence from AKR, propagating the changes into the production server.</p>
<p>Basic outage triage support shall be available 24x7x365.  Basic support includes power-on, power-off assistance, and entry-level on-site technical assistance to work cooperatively with AKR staff in the event of a service failure.  Advanced support capable of carrying out all tasks described in this statement of work shall be available in the event of an emergency Monday-Sunday 8a-5p.  2-hour on-call response for advanced support during 8a-5p weekend outages is acceptable.  Any planned service outage should be communicated to AKR staff at least 2 weeks in advance of the outage.</p>
<p>6)	Network access control/monitoring (Minimum): Contractor shall provide industry standard access control, allowing public access to TCP ports 80 and 443, and Secure Shell TCP port 22 access for traffic originating from specific subnets specified by AKR. Contractor shall provide network monitoring with intrusion detection and intrusion prevention consistent with industry norms.</p>
<p>7)	Event monitoring and notification (Minimum): Contractor shall provide 24x7x365monitoring of system availability, including CPU cycles, system memory, free disk space, TCP/IP connectivity, and application services and processes to be specified by AKR. Contractor shall provide notification of critical events to designated AKR staff via call-out lists and schedules maintained by AKR. Contractor shall provide ad-hoc reporting of monitored items for capacity management and trend analysis.<br /> <br />8)	Archive data (Minimum): Contractor shall provide mechanisms to archive data.  Contractor will provide a mechanism whereby a data snapshot of up to forty gigabytes in size can be recorded on removable media, and to mailed to AKR for short term storage with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Such archival copies will be required every 6 months, in March and September.</p>
<p>9)	Backup operations (Minimum): Contractor shall provide mechanisms and configuration service to backup data to alternative storage, and to restore data from alternative storage to the servers.  Services should include testing of backups as necessary to ensure backup functionality.</p>
<p>10)	Continuity of operations testing (Minimum): Contractor shall participate in periodic continuity of operations testing where the ability to recover from various failure modes will be demonstrated.  Failure modes to be tested shall include single disk spindle failure, single network interface or cable failure, and failure of one server.</p>
<p>A successful continuity of operations test will show production service restored within thirty minutes and other services restored (possibly with reduced capacity) within twenty-four hours.  This testing will only occur until two successful failover tests have been completed and documented.  Successful occurrences should be achieved at 3 months and 6 months after start of work, and at 3 months and 9 months after start of work for each option year.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DELIVERABLES and DEADLINE FOR EACH</p>
<p>1)	Interim Operational Capability (IOC), First Server: Within 14 days of arrival of a NMFS-supplied server, contractor shall have the first server installed and configured and available for AKR configuration and acceptance testing. Installation and configuration primarily refers to work required for appropriate network connectivity.  The server will arrive at contractor facility with all operating systems and applications pre-installed and configured.</p>
<p>2)	Full Operational Capability (FOC), First Server: Within 5 days of completion of acceptance testing for the first server IOC, contractor and AKR will coordinate an eLandings production cut-over to the first fully operational server.  At the conclusion of this cut-over, eLandings production will be fully operational in the contractor's data center, with Continuity of Operations Fallback to the previous eLandings production server remaining at prior facilities. (Contractor is not responsible for the Continuity of Operations Fallback to the previous eLandings server.)</p>
<p>3)	Full Operational Capability (FOC), Both Servers: Within 5 days of cut-over, AKR will ship the second server to contractor's data center facility.  Within five days of arrival, contractor shall have the second server installed and configured and available for AKR configuration and acceptance testing.  Subsequent to AKR acceptance, the second server will go live as the dev/test server and Continuity Operations Plan (COOP) backup for production.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541519 Other Computer Related Services and the small-business size standard is $25.5 million average annual receipts. The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price contract for this service.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.

Introduction:  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training & Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to improve squad training by leveraging existing training aids, devices, simulators and simulations (TADSS).  Part of the market research is to publish a Sources Sought Notice seeking market information on businesses able to provide the capabilities, as described in the below sections.  Where relevant, responses may include TADSS used to train other units in their collective tasks.   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this notice or the Government use of such information. This Sources Sought Notice is not tied to any current nor anticipated to be a precursor to any future request for proposals (RFP). <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> The NAICS Codes and Product and Service Codes (PSC) listed in Paragraph 5,  quote mark Additional Information, quote mark  may also be applicable to this Sources Sought Notice. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> 2. Background:  <br>  <br> The 2012 Army Strategic Planning Guidance (ASPG) establishes four imperatives, the first of which is to  quote mark Provide modernized and ready, tailored land force capabilities to meet Combatant Commanders' requirements across the range of military operations. quote mark  One key action in support of this imperative is to Train for Operational Adaptability, - emphasizing  quote mark both the Human Dimension and land dominance requirements of the operational environment quote mark . Another action is to Increase the Combat Power of Army Formations to achieve overmatch from the squad to the brigade and  quote mark ensure that our squads are never again in a fair fight. quote mark  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> This ASPG imperative underpins the Maneuver Center of Excellence's (MCoE) concept of the  quote mark Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force quote mark  that promotes Squad Overmatch. The MCoE has focused on the need for enhancing training in the cognitive, physical, social-cultural, resilience and moral-ethical components of the Human Dimension. <br>  <br>  <br> Today's squads have achieved proficiency in the Human Dimension through ten years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the future, as Soldiers remain at home station more and Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) becomes regionally aligned, proficiency will necessarily be gained using TADSS. The US Army is seeking to improve the capabilities of TADSS, for training a squad as a collective unit, by improving realism and providing a near real-life operational environment, through injection and control of mental/cognitive and emotional stressors.  Enhancing the live fire Shoot Houses, to provide for more realistic and dynamic training in order to develop psychological resilience, is but one of many technologies that could be leveraged. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> Numerous studies have indicated that a Soldier's resilience and human performance may be enhanced by training under more extreme conditions (e.g., injecting stressors such as battle sounds and smells), exposing them to more complex tasks (such as having to concurrently manage treatment of casualties, communicate with locals, and provide security) after adequate physical and psychological preparation.  The research emphasizes that training under extreme conditions alone does not harden the soldier to the stressor and does not necessarily improve resilience and performance.  Soldiers must be provided information about the stressors they will experience, and trained in techniques and methods for managing them.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> A comprehensive physical and psychological program for training the Soldier - to recognize situations that cause psychological stress, to have the Soldier apply learned techniques to manage the stress, and to provide an environment where situations that cause stress can be regulated, replayed, reviewed - appears to be the optimal approach to strengthening a Soldier's resilience and improving his performance, and thereby discouraging post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> The US Army Ready and Resilience Campaign defines resilience as  quote mark when faced with stress and/or adversity, [resilience] is a key factor in the mental, emotional, and behavioral ability to cope with and recover from the experience, achieve positive outcomes, adapt to change, stay healthy and grow from the experience quote mark  - enhanced performance is defined as  quote mark mental, emotional, and physical skills and health that generate optimal human performance. quote mark  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> 3. Submission Content: <br> The response to this notice should include, but is not limited to, answering the following questions: <br>  <br>            What technologies can be used alone, or added to current TADSS used for squad level training, that would improve the realism of the training environment to better approach the realities of war?  Address specific capabilities that are critical to inducing realistic stress on squads, during training, in order to enhance resilience and human performance.  Example capabilities include, but are not limited to, the following: <br>  <br> o    Combat environment (e.g., interactive targetry) <br>  <br> o    Social (e.g., interaction with locals, awareness of the squad as a team) <br>  <br> o    Psychological (sudden, critical unexpected situations such as losing a fellow Soldier or improvised explosive devices (IED)) <br>  <br> o    Extreme sensory stimuli (e.g., visual: building ruins, car fires ; sound: explosions, cries of wounded ; smell: rotting garbage, burning flesh ; touch: handling human remains, heat, effects of added gear)  <br>  <br>            What emerging technologies may be leveraged in the context of the above (first) question?  Address the technical readiness and path forward for these emerging technologies. <br>  <br>            How do we evaluate and measure TADSS and emerging technology effectiveness at closing the squad level-to-objective capability gap?   <br>  <br>            How can existing TADSS be integrated, augmented and extended with each other, and with emerging technologies, to provide optimal squad training? <br>  <br> o    What combinations of existing TADSS and emerging technologies promise the best return on investment based upon technology maturity, ease of integration, and resultant capability? <br>  <br>            Can your approach/solution be applied to the Operational Environment that includes all Combatant Commands (COCOM)? <br>  <br>            What lessons learned and capabilities, gained in recent operations, have proved successful in reducing combat stress, and can be applied to training? <br>  <br>            Are your approach/recommendations flexible enough to support Army squad leaders as they adapt to an ever-evolving operational environment and threat? <br>  <br>            Describe the science behind  quote mark how your approach would enhance Soldier/squad performance? quote mark  <br>  <br>            Describe how your technology could be used to  quote mark incrementally quote mark  increase levels of stress. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br> 4.

<a href="mailto:john.s.solomon.civ@mail.mil">MICC - Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a>
<DESC>Thank you for taking the time to assist us in gathering this information! <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), Washington, is currently conducting preliminary planning market research to determine commercial market practices and the existence of viable commercial sources capable of providing Multi-Purpose Target Range (MPTR) services for the Yakima Training Center (YTC).  The anticipated period of performance for the aforementioned requirement is a base period of 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2014, with four one-year option periods. <br>  <br> MICC, JBLM is seeking industry information and comments from sources with capabilities to perform the contract and with relevant experience in all of the functional areas mentioned in the description of services.  Interested parties shall complete and submit the attached RFI Questionnaire to the Government.  You are advised that providing responses to the questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for future solicitation.   <br>  <br> Description of services.  JBLM is one of the largest and most modern military reservations in the United States, which includes YTC, and is the premier military installation in the Northwest.  YTC has the best collective range in the Northwest.  YTC is an approximately 323,000 acre military reservation located in Yakima and Kittitas Counties in central Washington, approximately seven (7) miles north of the city of Yakima, Washington.  YTC is bounded on the north by Highway I-90; on the east by the Columbia River; Highway I-82 forms most of the western boundary; and the southern boundary is located approximately 6 Kilometers south of Yakima ridge.  YTC lies in a transitional zone between the Cascade Mountains and the Columbia Plateau.  The climate of the region surrounding YTC is characterized by hot, dry summers, and cold, dry-to-moist winters.  The average precipitation ranges from four (4) to six (6) inches per year.  Precipitation falls mainly during fall and spring.  Access to the Range and range operations may be hampered by snowfall and drifting snow.  Most of the land on YTC ranges from gently rolling to rugged terrain.  YTC is used primarily as a training area for large-scale military maneuvers, particularly those involving heavy wheeled and tracked vehicles (tanks and armored personnel carriers), and for training in use of large, long-range weapons.  Active Army, U.S. Army Reserves (USAR), National Guard (NG), Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, and Foreign Military Forces under a Standard of Forces Agreement that includes Canada and Japan in carrying out various military activities will utilize the Multi-Purpose Training Range (MPTR).  It is estimated that the MPTR, located in the northern section of YTC, will normally be utilized 248 days per year, equivalent to 380 eight (8)-hour man-days.    <br>  <br> Thus, the purpose requirement is to operate and maintain the MPTR, Range 1487A, and provide supplemental target and repair support to the Digital Multi-Purpose Range Complex (DMPRC) at YTC.  This effort is to provide training support to enhance the Training Units' abilities to accomplish missions successfully and support mobilization in accordance with Forces Command (FORSCOM) Regulation 350-2. <br>  <br> Performance shall include: <br>  <br> 1.	Operation and maintenance of Enhances Remote Equipment Target System (ERETS) equipment <br>  <br> 2.	Operation and maintenance of facilities <br>  <br> 3.	Road and tank trail maintenance <br>  <br> 4.	Operational Readiness: In order for the MPTR ranges to fulfill their training missions they must have a minimum number of targets up and in a completely functional mode.  This minimum number of targets will be known as the  quote mark operational readiness level quote mark  (ORL) and will be verified each day by a range test report.  The ORL for each of the MPRC ranges shall be 90% of all targets minus all targets for which Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) is being accomplished at that time.  <br>  <br> 5.	All administrative duties to include material requisitioning, quality control, development and maintenance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), records, files, and libraries of documents to include Federal, State, and Local regulations, codes, laws, technical manuals, and manufacturers' instructions and recommendations, which are necessary and related to the functions being performed, and shall compile historical data, prepare required reports.   <br>  <br> Disclaimer.

License terms may include field-of-use restrictions and performance milestones.<br /><br />Description:<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories has developed a novel mass flow sensor device for measuring a wide range of fluid flow rates over a pressure range exceeding 10,000 psi. The invention is particularly adapted for use in microfluidic systems, which are being developed and used in applications as diverse as in vitro diagnostics, sensors and detectors, biosecurity, biochemical research, and drug discovery. The device operates by electrochemically producing compositional variations in a fluid (pulses), that are subsequently detected downstream from the point of creation to derive a flow rate.  Measurements of the conductivity or pH of the fluid can be used to detect the arrival time of the pulses, from which the fluid flow rate can be determined.<br />Potential licensees must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, develop, distribute, and market the Mass Flow Sensor technology, either on its own or as part of a larger system.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by e-mail to Jill Micheau at Sandia National Laboratories, jmmiche@sandia.gov, phone: 925.294.3672. Please indicate the date and title of this FBO notice. Please include your company's contact information as well as a description of the fields of use that interest you and how you intend to commercialize the technology. <br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.<br /><br />Harnett, C.

<DESC>&nbsp; The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Switchgear Replacement at the Pittsburgh PA Processing and Distribution Center located at 1001 California Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15290-1008. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost of the project is between $2,500,000 and $3,000,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State of Pennsylvania, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for at least one but no more than five comparable projects. Comparable projects are defined as switchgear projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $500,000 or more that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing.<br /><br />The USPS may give preference to contractors whose offices are located within 400 miles of the work site.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most qualified contractors will be considered. Price will be considered more important than the other evaluation factors contained in the Management Plan. However, the Postal Service will select the offeror that provides the best value to the Postal Service.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations for similar work in this area. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes?

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?
    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly?

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(g) (1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) (1) (i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g) (1) (i) (C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><strong>Background</strong></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;DISA's internal IT Enterprise provides the full complement of IT services for approximately 4,200 DISA employees at the DISA Headquarters Building (1.1 million square feet of total office space) located at Fort George G. Meade, MD (hereto referred to as FGGM), as well as an additional 4,000 DISA employees accessing the enterprise via Local Area Networks (LAN's) located at 39 continental US (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) Department of Defense (DoD) locations. A major portion of DISA's IT Enterprise service work is performed at the DISA Headquarters facility. Additionally, a significant amount of the work is performed by support teams traveling to the Agency's CONUS and OCONUS DoD locations. The DISA's IT Enterprise also provides the full complement of IT services to non-DISA organizations (i.e., Industry Partner facilities in the NCR, and other DoD components). A major portion of DISA's IT Enterprise service work is performed at the DISA Headquarters. However, a significant amount of the work is performed by support teams traveling to the agency's CONUS and OCONUS DoD locations. <br /></span><br />The operation of DISA's IT Enterprise is managed by Government personnel with contractors performing many of the operational functions, such as Tier I Helpdesk and Network Monitoring and Reporting functions. Areas of operational responsibility for the DISA IT Enterprise are clearly delineated as either contractor or Government functions. As a result, there are numerous touch points between the contractor and Government personnel executing their DISA IT Enterprise responsibilities.</p>
<p>DISA's global IT Enterprise network is comprised of the data, voice, and video infrastructure that supports the mission requirements of the DISA Director, its Strategic Business Units and subordinate Directorates. The Enterprise employs over 550 physical and virtual servers on three classification levels, and uses approximately 9 principle tool suites to monitor its world-wide status. The DISA IT Enterprise provides network access to mission-oriented databases and applications maintained on non-DISA networks. In total, the Enterprise supports over 8,200 DISA users worldwide. Most of the IT services provided by the DISA IT Enterprise are operated by the Agency's CIO and currently based out of Fort Meade, Maryland. However, some of the IT services (i.e., email) are in the process of transitioning to the Agency's Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD).</p>
<p>DISA is anticipating numerous IT infrastructure consolidation initiatives across the DoD and anticipates other DoD organizations acquiring IT services from the DESS contract Additionally, DISA is anticipating that many of DISA's CONUS and OCONUS locations will begin acquiring IT support services from the DESS contract in order to align with many of the Agency's Campaign Plan initiatives.</p>

The machines were previously maintained under warranty with their purchase.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-66 (28 February 2013) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (28 March 2013).<br /><br />This RFQ is set-aside for small business concerns under the applicable NAICS code 811212 - Computer and Office Machine Repair and Maintenance, which has a Small Business Administration small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts. In order to be eligible for award of this purchase order, offerors <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span></strong> be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/ <strong>with completed representations and certifications</strong>.<br /><br />Offerors interested in responding to this requirement must provide a quote, at a minimum, for the CLINs identified in the attached spreadsheet. If a preliminary inspection is required, please state the price for such as a separate CLIN.<br /><br />Offerors must identify whether invoices will be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.<br /><br />In order to be considered for award, offerors must provide a quote for all CLINs listed.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a single firm fixed price (FFP) option year purchase order to the offeror representing the best value to the Government based upon the evaluation factors listed below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first. The Government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors. The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror.<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.<br /><br />Evaluation Factors (Listed in order of importance):<br /><br />1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Approach</span> - <strong>Offerors will provide a technical quote that details what is covered in the service agreement</strong>. Details should include, at a minimum, scheduled and emergency service, software upgrades, application training and support, hours of operation, labor and travel charges, and the number of preventive maintenance inspections per year, if applicable. Offerors must display a clear understanding of the requirements. Quotes submitted by offerors who fail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirement may not be considered further.<br /><br />Quotes submitted by offerors that include the following statement, or similar, without any supporting information, may be determined to not have a clear understanding of the requirement and may not be considered:<br /><br />"<em>The offeror understands the requirements and the submitted quote meets all stated objectives</em>."<br /><br />2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporate Experience</span> - Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in providing maintenance support on Canon copiers, to include software upgrades and application training and support.<br /><br />3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance</span> - The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three (3) years. Offerors must provide two (2) customer references for similar work performed. The Government reserves the right to select which reference(s) to contact.

Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references. Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.<br /><br />A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.<br /><br />4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price</span> - Interested offerors are to provide a firm fixed price (FFP) quote on all CLINs identified in the attached Excel spreadsheet.

<p>(vii) The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation and are included in full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.211-8 TIME OF DELIVERY (JUN 1997)<br />(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details]<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 470 60<br />0002 940 60<br />The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.<br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br /><br /><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Evaluation - Commercial Items provision 52.212-2 of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding<br />(1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or<br />(2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement</p>
<p>(2) Price</p>
<p>(b) Evaluations will begin with the Lowest Priced Offeror to verify Technical Acceptability. If the Lowest Priced Offeror is found to be Technically Acceptable, the Government will proceed with award to that Offeror. If the Lowest Priced Offeror is not found Technically Acceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability and so on until the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Offeror is found.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a proposal (or part of a proposal), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.212-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>This RFQ has one line item described as follows:</p>
<p>Ultrahigh Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer (one each) that meets the following specifications:</p>
<p>1) Operational wavelength range: 1520 - 1610 nm<br />2) Wavelength accuracy: +5 pm<br />3) Spectral resolution (FWHM): &lt;10 MHz<br />4) Dynamic range @+200MHz (+1.6pm at 1550 nm): 40 dBc<br />5) Power level measurement range: -70 to +10 dBm<br />6) Power level measurement accuracy: &lt;0.5 dB<br />7) Acquisition time (2000 points over 3 nm range): &lt;1 sec<br />8) Optical Input: FC/PC or FC/APC<br />9) Simultaneous measurements of both primary polarization states<br />10) External tunable laser access<br />11) Automatic calibration<br />12) User interface software features</p>
<p>The offer must submit a quotation providing information and data that shows the proposed item meets the specifications described above and that the offeror is willing to submit a sample item to be tested on 6 or 7 May 2013. Simply reiterating that the proposed item meets or exceeds the specifications is not acceptable. On a separate paper from the technical information, the quote must contain the price, a statement that the price will remain valid for 90 days after the date of the quote, and the amount of time needed for delivery of the required item. The quote must also include the quoting company's name, address, CAGE Code, Point-of-Contact's name, phone, and email address, Quotation Number and Date.</p>
<p>Technical Ability will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>Step A: The Government will initially evaluate the written quote to determine if the proposed item appears to meet the required specifications. If the quoted item does not meet the specifications, the quote will be determined to be technically unacceptable. If the evaluation determines the item appears to meet the required specifications, the contractor will be notified and required to provide a sample item to be tested on&nbsp;9 or&nbsp;10 May 2013. If the contractor can't submit a sample item to be tested on either of those dates, the quote will be determined to be non-responsive.</p>
<p>Step B: The items that appear to meet the required specifications based on the written quotations will be tested to ensure they meet the required specifications and be given a score. The score is the total time it takes to complete all of the steps in Attachment 1 (FA8601-13-T-0130 Ultra-High Resolution Optical Spectrum Analyzer Step B Test Process).<br /><br />The minimum number of people to be present at the testing of the item will be the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, the Government Program Manager, and the Contractor's Representative(s) (no more than two). At any time during the testing of the item it is discovered that the item fails to accomplish the specific tasks identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the testing will be stopped and the Contracting Officer will find the quote technically unacceptable.&nbsp;Each item to be tested will be submitted to the Government and returned to the contractor at the conclusion of the testing <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at no expense to the Government.</span></strong>&nbsp; Should the&nbsp;Contractor elect not to have a&nbsp;representative present at the time of the testing, the Contractor must arrange for the return of the item to the Contractor.&nbsp; The instructions for the return of the&nbsp;item must be provided to the Primary Point of Contact, Jan m. Holbrook by email (<a href="mailto:jan.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil">jan.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil</a>) before the start of the testing.&nbsp; An Alternate Point Of Contact is Regina Robinson who can be reached at <a href="mailto:regina.robinson@wpafb.af.mil">regina.robinson@wpafb.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; If the instructions for the return of the item are not received before the start of the testing, the item will not be tested and the quote will be considered technically unacceptable.&nbsp;The same Government samples will be used to test each contractor's submitted sample item.</p>
<p>If the testing of the sample item confirms the item meets all of the required specifications and accomplishes the specified tests in Tables 1, 2, and 3, it will be considered technically acceptable and given a score for Technical Ability. The score for Technical Ability is the total amount of time for the item to accomplish all of the tests identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3. (A lower score is considered better Technical Ability i.e., when comparing two or more scores for Technical ability, the Contractor with the lowest score would be considered to have the best Technical Ability.)</p>
<p>The Government will make an award from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose quote will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors that shall be used to evaluate the quotes are Technical Ability and Price, with Technical Ability more important than price.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to not make an award at all. By submission of a quotation, the offeror acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management Registration (SAM) prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. Point-of-Contact is Jan Holbrook (937) 522-4609. Offers can be emailed to jan.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil or to Alternate Regina Robinson at regina.robinson@wpafb.af.mil. All offers are due by 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Time,&nbsp;2 May 2013.</p>

Only after no sutable vendor is identified as acceptable will the contracting officer proceed to the next category for evaluation <BR> <BR>ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT?LABOR AND MATERIAL (JAN 1997) (a) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any time during contract performance, the rate of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or the unit prices for material shown in the Schedule either increase or decrease. The Contractor shall furnish this notice within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under this contract. The notice shall include the Contractor?s proposal for an adjustment in the contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b) of this clause, and shall include, in the form required by the Contracting Officer, supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and amount of the increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor?s adjustment proposal. (b) Promptly after the Contracting Officer receives the notice and data under paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall negotiate a price adjustment in the contract unit prices and its effective date. However, the Contracting Officer may postpone the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and decreases in the labor rates (including fringe benefits) and unit prices of material shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable under paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer shall modify this contract (1) to include the price adjustment and its effective date and (2) to revise the labor rates (including fringe benefits) or unit prices of material as shown in the Schedule to reflect the increases or decreases resulting from the adjustment. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on, or determination of, any adjustment and its effective date. . <BR> <BR>(c) Any price adjustment under this clause is subject to the following limitations: (1) Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect on unit prices of the increases or decreases in the rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material shown in the Schedule. There shall be no adjustment for? (i) Supplies or services for which the production cost is not affected by such changes; (ii) Changes in rates or unit prices other than those shown in the Schedule; or (iii) Changes in the quantities of labor or material used from those shown in the Schedule for each item. (2) No upward adjustment shall apply to supplies or services that are required to be delivered or performed before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor?s failure to deliver or perform according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor?s control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the Default clause. (3) There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which would not result in a net change of at least 3 percent of the then-current total contract price. This limitation shall not apply, however, if, after final delivery of all contract line items, either party requests an adjustment under paragraph (b) of this clause. (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases that may be made under this clause. (d) The Contracting Officer may examine the Contractor?s books, records, and other supporting data relevant to the cost of labor (including fringe benefits) and material during all reasonable times until the end of 3 years after the date of final payment under this contract or the time periods specified in Subpart 4.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is earlier. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 Days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days  before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 (years). <BR> <BR>DOI ELECTRONIC INVOICING Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements - Internet Payment Platform (IPP) APRIL 2011 
Beginning May 1, 2011, payment requests for all new awards must be submitted electronically through the U. S. Department of the Treasury's Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).  Payment terms for existing contracts and orders awarded prior to May 1 remain the same.  The Contractor must use IPP for contracts and orders awarded May 1 and later, and must use the non-IPP invoicing process for those contracts and orders awarded prior to May 1.  
"Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by the Contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the payment request must comply with the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment documentation and process" and the applicable Prompt Payment clause included in this contract.  The IPP website address is: https://www.ipp.gov.   
Under this contract, the following documents are required to be submitted as an attachment to the IPP invoice [CO to edit and include the documentation required under this contract]:
?	Reference Purchase Order ?	Invoice
The Contractor must use the IPP website to register, access and use IPP for submitting requests for payment. The Contractor Government Business Point of Contact (as listed in CCR) will receive enrollment instructions via email from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB) within 3 to 5 business days of the original contract award date.  Contractor assistance with enrollment can be obtained by contacting the IPP Production Helpdesk via email ippgroup@bos.frb.org or phone (866) 973-3131. If the Contractor is unable to comply with the requirement to use IPP for submitting invoices for payment, the Contractor must submit a waiver request in writing to the contracting officer. <BR> <BR>FAR  52.232-99, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors 
PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEVIATION) (AUG 2012) This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012. 
(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor. 
(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.
(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act. <BR> <BR>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows:

(iv) Alternate III (Mar 2012) of 52.225-3. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 32.1110(a)(1), insert the following clause: PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER?CENTRAL  CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003) (a) Method of payment.(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term ?EFT? refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either? (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor?s EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor?s EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for? (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor?s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and? (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (f) EFT and prompt payment. <BR> <BR>A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor?s financial agent. (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method (s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. (End of clause) <BR> <BR>Wage Determination is included as an attachment <BR> <BR>OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within      the original period of performance     . (End of clause) <BR> <BR>52.204-99 System for Award Management Registration (Class Deviation from 52.204-7) (September 2012) (DEVIATION) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause? ?Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database? means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. ?Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code? means? (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an ?NCAGE code.? ?Data Universal  Numbering  System (DUNS) number? means the 9- digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. ?Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number? means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)

FDA's Center for Tobacco Products ("CTP" hereinafter) implements PL 111-31 and H.R. 1256, Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was signed into law on June 22, 2009. The Tobacco Control Act granted FDA important new authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health. Since tobacco products are not regulated as drugs, their effects on human behavior and pharmacology have not been evaluated by FDA. The Contractor will provide scientific support necessary to assist in the implementation of this law under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act <br />Specifically the contractor will assist FDA by assessing tobacco product pharmacology and human dependence behaviors in healthy volunteer male and female tobacco users.<br />The Office of Science Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), therefore, plans to initiate a series of clinical studies to evaluate the impact of tobacco products on human behavior and pharmacology.

Studies will assess the impacts of tobacco products on dependence, craving, withdrawal relief, choice behavior, physiological effects, and measurement of biomarkers of exposure (e.g., nicotine, cotinine, CO, TSNAs). Data collected under this contract will inform FDA on the behavioral and pharmacological effects associated with tobacco product use, and may guide tobacco product policies and regulations. <br />Contractor Requirements: Contractors must respond to all of the following points, by indicating your experience and capability:<br />1.

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The purpose of this amended sources sought notification is to add industry questions and Government responses as below:<br />
<p><br />Industry Question #1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm trying to understand the target assets list. Are you intending to suggest that none of that list will be provided gfx? Or just no gff?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are all (or largely) government owned equipment. That's the source of my confusion. Thanks."</p>
<p>MDA Response to #1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"While all of the Lockheed Martin assets aremostly contractor acquired property or GFX, Lockheed Martin will continue to use it in delivery of the hardware. Therefore, the capability we are seeking must be able to create assets (delineated as 1-8 in the RFI) to support the services the Government requires."</p>

<DESC>Updates:<br />April 10, 2013 - Amendment 1 (Questions and Answers) uploaded to FBO.<br />April 2, 2013 - FBO Announcement updated to show a response date.<br />April 1, 2013 - RFP Package uploaded to FBO.<br /><br />==<br />The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) contemplates awarding one (1) Labor-Hour contract for one base year and four option years. This will be a competitive procurement set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) under NAICS Code 541611 (Size Standard: $14 million). This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds.
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requires the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to continue the operation of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Workplace Helpline for a contract period of one year with four optional years. The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week. It is estimated that an average of 8 to 10 inquiries are received per day. The Helpline individuals will normally operate the Helpline Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).</p>
<p>In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drug abuse in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts. In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer questions about drug abuse in the workplace. The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this requirement was initiated in 1987 and has continued uninterrupted since. Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the CSAP/SAMHSA. In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs of abuse. Additionally, the Workplace Helpline expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based program whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drugs of abuse in its community workplace.</p>
<p>The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent-small businesses. As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy. Small businesses also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems. The Workplace Helpline also answers a significant number of calls by individuals inquiring about workplace drug testing and substance abuse prevention and treatment issues regarding prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol use. The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.</p>
<p>The estimated date for issuance of the RFP is March 19, 2013 with proposal responses due April 19, 2013. The solicitation may be obtained in any of three ways: by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1067, Rockville, MD 20857; or FedBizOpps. If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individuals identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you. Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing. Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Blenda Perez, Procurement Analyst/PCO, Division of Contracts Management, OFR, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, DHHS, 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1067, Rockville MD 20857. Requests may be sent via fax to (240) 276-1510. Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 18 - Contracting Office is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<DESC>Project Work is divided into a base and two options which includes constructing a beach berm to an elevation +7.4 feet with a varying berm width. A permitted offshore borrow area for the project is located <br> approximately 4 miles southeast of the project site. Due to the extensive hard ground areas located offshore of the fill template area, offshore pipeline access to the beach site is prohibited. The Contractor will operate the off-loading from inside the South Jetty of Fort Pierce Inlet, FL. Staging area and beach access to the project fill area is located at the end of Seaway Drive also near the south jetty offloading area. <br>  <br> Because of environmental fill restrictions within the project (Refer to Specification ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION for further details), base work will begin fill operations at R-37 which is 3,000 feet south of the Fort Pierce Jetty and work southward for another 4,000 feet (R-41). The contractor <br> will then retreat fill operations at the South jetty and start fill operations at the south jetty and complete base work at R-35. Option 1 will place beach quality material between R-35 and T-36 and Option 2 will <br> place material between T-36 and R-37. Base and optional work also includes but is not limited to endangered species observers, sea turtle non-capture trawl sweeping, turbidity monitoring, beach tilling, and construction/vibration controls and monitoring. <br>

<AWARDEE>EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS, LLC;6901 ROCKLEDGE DRIVE STE 600;BETHESDA;MD;208177836
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a 12 month firm-fixed price (FFP) contract for Statistical Analysis System (SAS) maintenance renewal support, with Executive Information Systems (EIS).  This effort is proposed to be awarded on a sole source basis under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract Number GS-35F-0170K to EIS, 6901 Rockledge Drive Ste 600, Bethesda MD, 20817-7836. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to provide   SAS maintenance renewal for SAS Version 9.3.  The maintenance renewal will enable  the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) to continue to utilize the SAS computational and analytical toolset to analyze statistics  on VA programs to inform and enable  improved outcomes for Veterans through better policies  and improved  efficiency  and effectiveness of VA operations. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this action is EIS.  EIS is the exclusive authorized reseller for version eight and later of the SAS maintenance renewal as detailed in the market research section. 

SAS Analytics provides an integrated environment for predictive and descriptive modeling, data mining, text analytics, forecasting, optimization, simulation, and experimental design. SAS provides a range of techniques and processes for the collection, classification, analysis and interpretation of data to reveal patterns, anomalies, key variables and relationships, leading to new insights and better answers faster. 

Only SAS offers an integrated suite of analytics software that provides the interoperability and compatibility with the current OIT environment. SAS software is the only complete functional statistical program that can be utilized by OIT because of compatibility with existing data throughout VA and affiliated institutions.  This request is to provide annual software maintenance renewal for SAS products Version 9.3 currently installed on user work stations. Failure to renew the software maintenance will result in an inability to receive software updates including security patches and updates.  

Without this analytical software supporting OIT's computing environment, OIT will not be able to provide VA with the latest analytical support for patient safety and healthcare outcomes initiatives, which are becoming increasingly large and complex.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition. 

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed. Additionally, this Justification and Approval and the Request For Quotation will be posted to e-Buy. Any proposals that are received will be evaluated. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(11), this effort is exempt from synopsizing since the proposed contract action is an order placed under an existing contract. 

8.  Market Research:  

Market Research was conducted on February 15, 2013 utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) Manufacturer Lookup tool and the GSA Advantage Product tool. VA identified seven authorized resellers for SAS products on the NASA SEWP GWAC. However, further market research indicated that none of the seven authorized resellers under NASA SEWP are capable of providing SAS maintenance renewal support for SAS Version 9.3. On February 21, 2013 it was discovered EIS is the exclusive reseller of SAS products and services of Version eight or later to the US Government.  Furthermore, on February 28, 2013 a Request for Information (RFI) was posted on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Page to verify if there are any authorized resellers who can provide the maintenance renewal for SAS Version 9.3. On March 1, 2013, the RFI closed; two companies responded to the RFI, EIS was the only company capable of providing the SAS maintenance renewal for SAS Version 9.3.

9.  Other Facts: None.
