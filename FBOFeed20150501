<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (CTIS) has a validated requirement to field an additional 1294 PRTLS radios and associated accessories to the U.S. Army's JMRC at Hohenfels, Germany.  A CTIS project team fielded the additional 900 PRTLS radios and modified the communications network at the JMRC in 2012. The existing Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) communications infrastructure at JMRC required that only certain radio technology be employed to meet technical requirements of this infrastructure and to comply with German spectrum requirements. In short, the PRTLS radio for JMRC is a unique device which is only used at JRMC.  The field radio was manufactured by Sepura PLC, who was able to cost effectively adapt (tailor firmware) one of its existing products to satisfy the JMRC PRTLS requirement. <br>  <br> This procurement of 1294 radios and accessories must also employ the same non-standard, TETRA-based radio architecture, operating on the appropriate radio frequencies (366 MHz to 371 MHz), that is tailored to operate on and be compatible with the existing JMRC communications infrastructure and training environment. It must already be approved, via the JF-12 process, by the German National Radio Frequency Office (NARFA) and meet U.S. Army safety requirements by possessing a safety confirmation.   The PRTLS radios will be required to have firmware and software installed to be compatible with the existing instrumentation system.    <br>  <br> These PRTLS radios are an integral part of the  JMRC Instrumentation System (JMRC-IS) which collects, processes, displays, and stores training performance data from Soldiers performing live, collective training at the JMRC.  The PRTLS radios perform an essential function in these training exercises by collecting training data from vehicles and dismounted Soldiers and relaying that information to the Core of the JMRC-IS for use in monitoring the training exercise and providing After Action Review (AAR) feedback to the Soldiers in training.   <br>  <br> The following list identifies the type, quantities, components and capabilities of the required PRTLS capability: <br>    <br> (1)  1294 JMRC Instrumentation System-compatible radios with Man Down Feature <br> (2)  1294 antennas <br> (3)  3842 high capacity batteries <br> (4)  39     high-capacity, 24-way battery chargers with leads <br> (5)  1294 protective radio pouches (for dismounted Soldiers) <br> (6)  One-year radio and antenna warranty; options for two and three additional years. <br>   <br>  <br> The technical requirements for the PRTLS radios and accessories are: <br>  <br> (1)  Radio requirements: <br> 		 <br> a)	Approved by the National Radio Frequency Agency (NARFA) for use in Germany <br> b)	Enhanced Global Positioning System (GPS) with integrated option of -182 dBw acquisition sensitivity and 185 dBw tracking sensitivity.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Edgewood Contracting Division (ECD), on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), by and through the Joint Product Manager CBRNE Analytics and Response Systems (JPdM CBRNE A&RS) within the Joint Program Manager Guardian (JPMG), intends to competitively solicit proposals, on a full and open basis, for the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) Phase of the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) program.  Specifically, the CALS EMD effort will involve designing, developing, fabricating, integrating, and testing the CALS in multiple configurations in accordance with (IAW) the CALS System Performance Specification (SPS) and this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The estimated period of performance for the CALS EMD effort is 3.5 years.  The solicitation will contain multiple contract types and options in order to most efficiently execute the CALS EMD effort.  Specifically, all Non-Recurring Engineering, Test Support, Logistics, ect. will be completed on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee basis.  Initial CALS components will be procured via a Firm Fixed Price contract type.  The individual CALS configurations will be procured via Fixed Price Incentive options.  The below provides additional information on CALS and estimated quantities for each configuration. <br>  <br> CALS integrates a common suite of commercial- and government-off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of CBR materials in environmental samples.  The CALS program will develop and field two integrated system configurations to support an array of CBR missions for DoD field analytic units.  Each configuration will support either field confirmation- or theater validation-level environmental CBR analysis.    The configurations will be developed using modular open systems architectures (MOSA), and include: <br>  <br> Field Confirmatory Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).  Supports tactical decisions in the field regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates common CBR capabilities into a common 20-foot ISO container. <br>  <br> Analytical Capability Set Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).   A palletized/transportable configuration.  This transportable configuration enables end users to receive the CBR subsystems that meet their specific mission profiles, while also enabling CBR subsystems to operate in a range of user-provided laboratory enclosures/shelters.  <br>  <br> Theater Validation Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 2 each).  Similar to the Field Confirmatory Configuration, but provides an expanded CBR capability and higher degree of confidence in the analytical results.  Analysis from the Theater Validation Variant provides additional critical information to support timely and effective operational-level decisions regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates an expanded CBR capability into a set of 20-foot ISO containers. <br>  <br> Interested parties are advised that certain documentation pertaining to the CALS effort is export controlled and as such, access to this documentation will be restricted utilizing the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Interested parties will need valid contractor login credentials to access this information once it has been posted. <br>  <br> The CALS EMD effort will be solicited on a full and open competition basis and will utilize a best value trade-off approach.  It is estimated that solicitation W911SR-14-R-0002 will be issued for the CALS EMD effort no later than 23 May 2014.  <br>  <br> The point of contact for this effort is Ms. Suzanne M. Drake, Contract Specialist.  All inquiries should be directed to suzanne.m.drake2.civ@mail.mil. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted. <br>  <br>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br> THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested party's expense. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. However, in order to validate an acquisition strategy through efficient market research, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories, are highly encouraged to respond to identify capabilities in meeting the requirements.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> A need is anticipated for an undetermined quantity of the brand name item of a Rapid Deployment Kit, Model # GV1-RZ12-120 built by RAE Systems. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research to determine if capable, interested sources exist to assist in determining if this effort can be set-aside for small business (to include 8(a) Business Development Program participants, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns, Service disabled veteran-owned (SDVOSB), and Women-owned small businesses (WOSB)), and to improve the Army's approach to acquiring the identified services.  <br>  <br> The Army is committed, when conducting market research, to request no more than the minimum information necessary from potential sources.  With that in mind, the Army requests the following information: <br>  <br> 1.  Please provide information sufficient to form a basis for the contracting officer to conclude there is a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and that award would be made at fair market prices.  <br>  <br> 2.  Additionally, to permit the contracting officer, in accordance with FAR 19.203(c), to first consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic contracting programs (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs) before considering a small business set-aside (see 19.502-2(b)), please provide: <br>  <br> a.  Information sufficient to form a basis for the contracting officer to conclude there is a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from two or more HUBZone small business concerns, and that award would be made at a fair market price; <br>  <br> b.  Information sufficient to form a basis for the contracting officer to conclude there is a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from two or more service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, and that award would be made at a fair market price; <br>  <br> c.  Information sufficient to form a basis for the contracting officer to conclude there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) firms would submit offers and that award could be made at a fair market price; <br>  <br> d.  Information sufficient to form a basis for the contracting officer to conclude there is a reasonable expectation that two or more WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program (including EDWOSB concerns), will submit offers and that contract award may be made at a fair and reasonable price; <br>  <br> 3.  Please identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns. <br>  <br> 4.  To the extent of your knowledge of the industry, please provide a list of all potential contractors who could reasonably perform the needed services. <br>  <br> 5.  Please identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. <br>  <br> 6.  Please recommend an acquisition strategy outlining how the Army should acquire the needed services. <br>  <br> Please submit all responses to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Anital L.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Surgery Branch (SB), on a sole source basis plans to procure Illumina's TruSeq RNA-Seq library prep kits and Mid/High output Flow cell kits from Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122, USA.
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The Government contemplates only one award and will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>This will be awarded as a firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The period of performance of the IDIQ contract is for five (5)-years, from the date of award. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 325413 with the Business Size Standard 500 employees. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The Surgery Branch (SB), of the National Cancer Institute is a combined laboratory and clinical research unit devoted to the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies and their translation to the treatment of patients with cancer. Efforts run the gamut from basic studies of cancer immunology to the conduct of clinical immunotherapy trials for patients with metastatic cancer. The Illumina TruSeq RNASeq reaction kits and Mid/High-output Flow cell kits are used specifically the NEXTSeq500 high-throughput DNA sequencer that NCI has acquired for whole genome, whole exome and whole transcriptome analysis. The data generated on NCI's sequencer using these kits and flow cells is essential for carrying out ongoing high priority projects to identify mutated antigens recognized by patient tumor-reactive T cells. Identification of these targets provides the SB with powerful tools that were recently used to guide cancer immunotherapy for a patient with a gastrointestinal tumor. The utilization of NGS genomic and proteomic studies in the SB lab will be applied to the treatment of a large population of patients with a variety of malignancies.</p>
<p>The unique qualities provided by Illumina, Inc is relevant to NCI, as the contractor is the only company that can fulfill the all requirements of this procurement in a cost effective and timely manner. Illumina's NextSeq 500 NGS sequencing platform enables researchers to perform multiple sequencing applications in one platform allowing for fast samples-to-results workflow in one piece of equipment. The NextSeq 500 system is capable of doing whole-genomes, whole-exomes, whole-transcriptomes, and many other analyses in a single run that takes ~29hrs compared to 72+hrs for other NGS platforms. Essentially this system will give NCI, at a read depth of 2 X 150bp, 100-200Gb worth of data which translates to roughly ~800 million paired-end reads in ~30hrs (High Output Kit). The whole-exome and whole-transcriptome project, which is a major focus of ongoing studies in the Surgery Branch to develop novel cancer therapies, has made exclusive use of Illumina technologies to identify somatically mutated gene products expressed by individual patient tumors. To date the SB have sequenced approximately 30 whole-exomes and 20 whole-transcriptomes using Illumina platforms. Additionally, NCI must have reagents that are compatible with the Illumina platforms for NGS. The acquisitions of these reagents from Illumina are critical to the ability to treat cancer patients in a more personalized approach, fitting with the mission statement of the NIH.</p>
<p>Lastly, Illumina is the only company that can provide the NextSeq 500 sequencing platform flow cell kits, and TruSeq RNA Seq library prep kits, required by NCI to generate labeled libraries for whole-exome or whole-transcriptome analysis. Purchasing reagents from another company would be disruptive to the science. Therefore, NCI feels Illumina is the best contractor to have continuity in our studies to ensure precision and accuracy within our clinical trials and projects.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party especially a small business, believes they can meet the above requirement, may submit a quote and statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. All questions, quote, and the capability statement must be received electronically (via email) to Ms. Gwennifer Epps, Contracting Officer, at ge50d@nih.gov in MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)by May 18, 2015 no later than 11:00 AM EST. No telephone calls or facsimiles will be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), through sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02RC52559-83 on all correspondence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).&nbsp; THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.&nbsp; A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT MAY 18, 2015.</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">THE ANTICIPATED DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THE RFP IS ON OR ABOUT JULY 2, 2015.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), &nbsp;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) is planning to issue an RFP for &nbsp;multiple Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts for a period of five (5) years for the Newborn Screening Pilot Studies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The purpose of this acquisition is to create a pool of high throughput newborn screening laboratories with the capacity to screen a large number of newborns in relatively short periods of time that are representative of various regions of the United States. The selected Contractors will operate under an IDIQ Task Order contract to rapidly develop protocols and initiate testing shortly after the addition of a new condition to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 31"core conditions" and that 26 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Public Law 113-240 Sec 116 of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014 encourages the NIH to &ldquo;conduct pilot studies on conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee to ensure that screenings are ready for nationwide implementation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">It has become evident however, that a major impediment to implementing new technologies in high throughput newborn screening laboratories is the ability to provide evidence of the feasibility of the assay, both scientifically and logistically, in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of disorders considered for newborn screening are rare diseases where the likelihood of detecting cases during standard newborn screening in a single laboratory is very low.&nbsp; For this reason collaborative efforts, implemented across multiple states or newborn screening laboratories, are necessary for the successful implementation of assays and the addition of new conditions to the RUSP.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">The requirements of the contract will not extend beyond the scope of what a state or entity would do to add any new condition to the state newborn screening panel and does not include what would be considered "research" under the HHS protection of human subjects regulations, 45 CFR Part 46. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Contractors shall collaborate with other Federal agencies focusing on their areas of expertise in the field. The Contractors shall also leverage infrastructure resources that are part of NICHD&rsquo;s NBSTRN.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Contractors shall, in a State Newborn Screening environment, 1) provide validation of technologies amenable to newborn screening; 2) perform confirmatory testing with sensitive and specific diagnostic tests; 3) refer children who screen positive for treatment and provide follow-up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Testing will be implemented state-wide for all newborns with no randomization and testing platforms will be chosen by the state.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Contractor shall perform testing on a variety of newborn screening appropriate disorders recommended by the RUSP.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. The RFP is subject to the availability of funds.&nbsp; The RFP will be available electronically on or about May 18, 2015 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps website at </span><a style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;" href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/">http://www.FedBizOpps.gov</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to Matthews Media Group, Inc. for continued participant recruitment support services without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).<br /><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 with a Size Standard of $14 Million.<br /><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-81 dated April 10, 2015.
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR Subpart 13 - Simplified Acquisitions. This acquisition is <strong>NOT</strong> expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br /><strong><br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the NIDA IRP with continuity of participant recruitment support services necessary to maintain the operation of the NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program while the requirement completes the final stages of re-competition. <br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services and materials for the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Project Management</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide sufficient project management support to ensure adequate staffing and any supervision of that staff as necessary for smooth daily operations of recruitment activities. This effort shall oversee staffing the call center, providing for in-person screening, and managing the flow of participants throughout the day. Project management support shall also provide for the reporting requirements of this contract as detailed in the deliverables section of this statement of work. Finally, the contractor shall be responsible for proper invoicing. In particular, the contractor shall ensure the inclusion in all invoices of costs associated with the participant screening process, such as participant transportation and meals, if needed, as well as the staffing hours, ads developed and run, and tracking of participant remuneration.</p>
<p>2. Advertisement Support</p>
<p>The NIDA IRP is based in Baltimore, MD and clinical protocol participants must only be recruited from the Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC areas. The Contractor shall provide general advertising support to include posting advertisements to Craigslist, generally up to six IRB approved postings two or three times weekly. The Contractor shall also manage the NIDA IRP recruiting website which is hosted by NIH. The Contractor shall additionally provide specific advertising support several protocols, as required. This specific support shall include ad placement in local newspapers, buses, radio, and some web advertising such as Craigslist. The NIDA IRP will provide prepared advertisements for placement for this purpose.</p>
<p>3. Participant Screening</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform participant screening in two phases: 1) telephone interviews and 2) in-person screening.</p>
<p>a. Telephone Screening</p>
<p>The NIDA IRP currently conducts roughly 350 telephone screening interviews per month. All potential clinical research program participants must successfully complete telephone interviews. Telephone interviews are structured and shall be performed by the contractor using IRB-approved scripted language. Interviews are computer based, and the contractor shall ensure accurate and timely electronic data entry of pertinent information into the HuRIS electronic medical record system. For this purpose, the contractor shall be proficient in communicating effectively with drug user populations while assessing their histories and needs, interpreting the data in the context of the current epidemiology and natural history of drug use, misuse, addiction and treatment for appropriate referral to research opportunities.</p>
<p>The contractor shall generally provide for telephone screening support Monday through Friday from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. Hours may vary slightly due to timing of advertisements; for example, a radio ad run during a baseball game would require a flexible work schedule to ensure that staff is available to answer the phone as soon as the ad runs. This may be managed by allowing some contractor personnel to arrive later in the day; overtime shall not be approved for this function.</p>
<p>b. In-Person Screening</p>
<p>The contractor shall offer all potential participants successfully completing telephone interview screens an appointment for in-person screening. The contractor shall then schedule and perform the in-person screening. Informed consent must be obtained from each participant for screening protocol and procedure including completion of appropriate screening instruments. Generally, in-person screening takes six to eight hours and is conducted in one day. If in-person screening cannot be completed in one day, the contractor shall schedule additional testing as necessary under the guidance of NIDA IRP research team members. Approximately 100 initial and 100 follow up appointments are scheduled each month.</p>
<p>The in-person screening process requires coordination with NIDA IRP staff including but not limited to Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners and Physicians. The Contractor shall provide medical assistant support for basic medical assessments including obtaining vital signs, drawing blood, performing ECGs, urine pregnancy testing, CO monitoring, breathalyzer and testing urine for drugs of abuse. The Contractor will also supply the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver testing kits needed for pregnancy, HIV and urine testing for drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>The contractor shall assess participant responses during the screening process. Accordingly, the contractor must be knowledgeable in drug use disorders, medical and psychiatric measures, and psychiatric interviewing. The contractor must have strong and professional interpersonal skills to ensure appropriate explanations of the current research protocols for which the participant may be eligible.</p>
<p>The contractor shall enter all in-person screening information, from scheduling through screening results, in the HuRIS. Computer proficiency is necessary to ensure proper and accurate recording of participant clinical records.</p>
<p>In the event a participant does not qualify for a protocol but desires treatment, the contractor shall use the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website to make appropriate referrals to community providers for medical and drug treatment as needed during recruitment in coordination with the NIDA IRP research team. The contractor shall also perform structured exit interviews with individuals screened for research participation.</p>
<p>4. Participant Recruitment Administrative Support</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for on-site administrative support relating to the participant recruitment process. Potential clinical research participants visit the NIDA IRP on a regular basis for screening procedures and enrolled clinical research participants visit the NIDA IRP on a regular basis to participate in protocols. The Contractor shall manage the Clinical Research Program front-desk, including the answering of telephones and performance of clerical activities, oversee participant and potential participant check-in and check-out, and assist with the participant remuneration process as well as other project management activities as requested.</p>
<p>5. Participant Remuneration</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the remuneration of all the NIDA IRP clinical research program participants. In keeping with the NIDA Remuneration Policy, as participants complete sections of a protocol, the contractor shall so indicate in the electronic medical records system, HuRIS. At pre-determined times within each protocol the contractor shall disburse remunerations to participants. The funds may be checks, paying bills for the participant, gift cards or cash as defined by the protocol. The contractor shall ensure that the HuRIS exactly records the funds distributed monthly. The contractor shall also track individual PIs' use of remuneration allowances. In the event that one or more PI(s) approaches his or her allowable remunerations limit or has insufficient funds to pay participants in any given week, the contractor must notify the Clinical Director or his designee, the COR and the alternate COR, and the principal investigator(s) immediately via email.</p>
<p>6. Reporting</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide weekly remuneration reports and a monthly recruitment program, advertising, and IRB reportable events reports.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance<br /></strong>The period of performance shall be May 15, 2015 to June 12, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Contract Contemplated<br /></strong>The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Matthews Media Group, Inc. is the only contractor capable of meeting the needs of this requirement in the time frame required. The current contract is being re-competed and is expected to be awarded within the next two months. This requirement is for continuity of services until the new contract is awarded. Matthews Media Group, Inc., the incumbent contractor, currently works closely with each NIDA IRP Principal Investigator to recruit potential participants for their protocols and protocol participants are necessary to ensure that NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program continues until a new recruitment contract is awarded. Presently there are 18 protocols actively recruiting, each with its own set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening for these protocols requires a very detailed working knowledge of all of the studies and the recruitment process. The team of screeners provided by the Contractor has completed the lengthy process of training required by both the NIH and the NIDA IRP to be allowed access to our in-house electronic medical records system. These lengthy training processes are IRB-mandated for the protection of our potential participants. The ramp up necessary to bring in a new Contractor at this time, and for only a period or performance two months or less until a new competitive contract, is awarded, would be unreasonable. Accordingly, use of any other contractor to perform these services on the immediate and short term basis required would be to the significant detriment of ongoing scientific research and is therefore impossible.</p>

<DESC><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 2101 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, DC 20002 to establish a Cost Reimbursement type contract for post-doctoral Research Associates in support of NOAA's congressional mandated scientific research.  NAS accomplishes this requirement through NAS's National Research Council (NRC) Post-Doctoral Residential Research Associateship Program (RAP) to which NOAA is a participating agency.
<p>The NRC has conducted the Research Associateship Programs in cooperation with sponsoring federal laboratories and other research organizations approved for participation since 1954. Through a national competition, the NRC recommends and makes Research Associateship awards to outstanding scientists and engineers, at the postdoctoral and senior levels, for tenure as guest researchers at the participating laboratories in NOAA.  NOAA requires the the use of the NRC RAP to fulfill its scientific research mission. NAS is uniquely positioned to convene special panels for review of competitive applications to the RAP and to provide overall management and oversight of the RAP.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(5), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5(c)(1)(iii)(B), NAS is in a unique position because of the long established status of the National Academy of Sciences (the Academy) as a noncompetitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government which began with its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by Executive Order (E.O.) 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the Academy was most recently formally affirmed in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to the Government and its unique capacity to marshal scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science. Specifically, E.O. 12832 states that " When a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that the Academy, because of its unique qualifications, is the only source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department's or agency's program requirements, acquisition of services by the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with applicable law and regulations."</p>
<p>The Academy has the unique ability to provide the measure of expertise, independence, and objectivity necessary to meet the program requirements for the NRC RAP. The Academy's uniqueness was recognized by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council, which included a specific reference to the Academy in FAR 6.302-5(c)(1)(iii)(B), which provides that certain limitations on sole source awards made in connection with a specific provision of the FAR do not apply to "any contract requiring the Academy to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government".   Negotiations with NAS are expected to result in an Cost Reimbursement contract with a period of performance of one year with four (4) one-year options. This contract will provide NOAA with independent and objective science to further the NOAA and U.S. Government research mission.  This sole source is permitted per FAR 6.302-5(c)(1)(iii)(B).  This is not a solicitation. A copy of the solicitation has not yet been produced. If contract award results from a Justification for Other then Full and Open Competition (JOFOC), a copy of the JOFOC will posted at this site. Written inquiries must reference requisition number NFFP7600-15-00506.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: Isotope analysis of atmospheric trace gases and measurement of Volatile Organic Compounds in atmospheric air samples
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility; Samples to be delivered to:<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) David Skaggs Research Center in Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 541380 - Testing Laboratories and the small business size standard is $15.0 M.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Global Monitoring Division (GMD) Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (GGGRN) is seeking sources that can provide an analysis of isotopic ratios, radio carbon, and volatile organic compounds from atmospheric air samples from the network. NOAA is seeking a vendor capable of providing all of the requirements described below.</p>
<p>The analysis of atmospheric trace gases from NOAA GGGRN atmospheric air samples (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/) is a critically important component of NOAA's research. In addition to the mole fraction measurements of these air samples made at NOAA, there is significant added value from analysis of isotopic ratios, radio carbon, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) from these same air samples. Isotopic ratios add information on atmospheric greenhouse gas sources and sinks that is not available from measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations alone. For example, measurements of the 13CO2:12CO2 ratio in CO2 can provide information on ecosystem level drought stress and ecosystem photosynthetic pathways, in addition to the fractions of atmospheric CO2 absorbed by the land and the oceans. Measurements of the carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios in atmospheric methane similarly provide information on the sources and sinks responsible for observed atmospheric variations of the compound. While CO2 concentration measurements constrain the total amount of carbon sources and sinks, the addition of 14CO2:12CO2 ratio measurements allow for the direct atmospheric determination of fossil fuel-derived CO2 sources (and by difference, the sources and/or sinks from the terrestrial biosphere). VOC, in particular non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and NMHC/methane correlations, provide insight into biogenic versus human methane sources, photochemical formation of pollutants, and regional tropospheric ozone production with implications for human health and ecosystem services.</p>
<p>Isotope analysis of multiple atmospheric trace gases and measurement of VOC in atmospheric air samples from the GGGRN and related programs are required. Aliquots are to be taken from a) pairs of 2.2 liter sample flasks in the global network and b) samples within Programmable Flask Packages (PFPs). Precision requirements are those deemed necessary for scientifically meaningful detection of expected gradients within the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of providing all of the analyses as stated in the work statement. In addition, the vendor shall meet a required two week turn-around time.</p>
<p>Base Period<br />Processing requirements:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated Number <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Samples<br />Stable isotopes of Carbon Dioxide (CO2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000<br />Radiocarbon (14C) of Carbon Dioxide (CO2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,850<br />Stable isotopes of Methane (CH4):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,500<br />Volatile Organic Compounds and Non-methane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 350<br />Hydrocarbons<br />Stable Isotopes of Carbon Monoxide (CO):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500<br />Stable isotopes of Nitrous Oxide (N2O):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS PROCUREMENT WILL BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING AND DOWNLOADING ON OR ABOUT 14 May 2015 MAR 2015. THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE WILL BE ON OR ABOUT 15 June 2015, 2:00 P.M. EDT NORTH AMERICA.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic (NAVFAC LANT) intends to issue a request for proposal for Replacement of Mission Critical Electrical Equipment (Generator, Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS), and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)) at the Information Dominance Corps Centers. The centers are located in the following locations: Denver, CO; Detroit, MI; Fort Worth, TX; Jacksonville, FL; Millington, TN; Minneapolis, MN; New Orleans, LA; and San Diego, CA.
  This will be a full and open competitive procurement. 

This project requires the replacement of the existing building generator, ATS, and UPS for nine different project sites at eight different military installations. Two of the project sites are located in Fort Worth, TX. The existing generator, UPS and ATS that are to be replaced will be salvaged and turned over to the US government. The new generators (250 kW and larger) will be self-contained outdoor package units equipped with integral fuel tanks. The new automatic transfer switches (600 amperes and larger) will be 4-pole type and equipped with the maintenance bypass/isolation feature. The new UPS units (160 kVA and larger) will consist of a UPS module, battery system, static bypass transfer switch, controls and monitoring.
 The UPS units will have the same input and output voltage. A new dry type transformer will be required for systems that require a different voltage downstream of the UPS unit. The Jacksonville center will require the replacement of two computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units. Work will include structural modifications to existing generator concrete pads, mechanical and plumbing work associated with the installation of the new CRAC units, and extensive electrical work for the installation of the new generators, ATS, and UPS units. Commissioning of all electrical and mechanical equipment will be required as part of this project. Operation and maintenance documentation for all electrical and mechanical equipment will be required as part of this project.
 

The period of performance is approximately 24 months after notice to proceed.

This procurement will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery / Definite Quantity Contract and firm-fixed price task orders for each military installation location will be awarded.  The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range.  The magnitude of construction range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

This contract will require a Performance Bond pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.228-15, through an approved surety under the United States Treasury Department Circular 570. 

The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by FAR 15.203 for a negotiated procurement utilizing procedures of FAR 36.2.
 This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits  impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose proposal provides the best value to the Government.

The technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be as follows: Corporate Experience, Safety, and Past Performance.

*Site visits are not available for this procurement.  All information necessary to submit a proposal will be provided with the RFP.

The Government intends to issue the Solicitation through the internet at www.neco.navy.mil and www.fbo.gov.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.
  All contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

FOUO (Unclassified)

The drawings and specifications are marked For Official Use Only (FOUO) / Unclassified and are subject to Distribution Statement C.
 Drawings and specifications will be released with the Solicitation. 

Distribution Statement C: Distribution authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their Contractors; Administrative/Operational use (June 1991).  Other requests for this document will be referred to NAVFACENGCOM (Code 51).

In order to access/view/download the Request for Proposal, drawings and specification from Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) each company is required to have a MPIN as described below.

The Marketing Partner ID Number (MPIN) is mandatory for SAM registrants and contains nine characters. An MPIN is a personal code (password) that allows you to access government applications such as the FedBizOpps and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).
 

To view your companys MPIN:

1.	Go to the SAM Homepage: www.sam.gov.
2.	Enter your user ID and password, then click the Log In button.
3.	Locate your entity via the Complete Registrations or Incomplete Registrations link under Manage Entity in the left navigation pane.
4.	Go to the Business Information page to view and change your MPIN.

Getting Your MPIN

1.	Look up your DUNS at the following URL: www.sam.gov
2.	Check the status of your company profile. It must be active in the System for Award Management (SAM) for the user to be able to register it in FedBizOpps.
3.	If there is a problem with the profile, such as expired account or a missing mandatory data element, please contact the Entity Registration Representative for your company.
4.	If it is a new SAM registration (within 24 hours), please try again in 24-48 hours (excluding the weekend).
 That is how long it takes SAM to process the information and send the update to FBO.gov for processing.
5.	If your SAM registration is active, and it has been more than 48 hours (excluding the weekend) since it was created, it is generally an issue where the incorrect DUNS/MPIN combination is being used. Please confirm the DUNS/MPIN information with your Entity Registration Representative again to ensure the correct MPIN is being used. Be careful not to confuse the TIN with the MPIN. For large companies with multiple DUNS, pay close attention to which MPIN is assigned to which DUNS.
6.	If all of the above items are validated and you are still having an issue, please contact the Federal Service Desk for further assistance.
 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of the contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government. The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov. Reference is made to FAR Clause 52.2047), System for Award Management. Prospective offerors are encouraged to register as soon as possible. All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in SAM.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide training land management capability across the total Army.  The US Army recognizes that the execution of training to doctrinal standards under realistic combat conditions will affect the environment.  The ITAM Program is also an essential part of the Army's commitment to environmental stewardship.  ITAM establishes a systematic framework for decision-making and management of Army training lands.  This allows the Army to manage its land in an environmentally sound manner to ensure no net loss of training lands for accomplishing primary activities (training, testing, storage, etc,) or for impacting the overall training capability.  The effective integration of stewardship principles into training land and conservation management practices ensures that the Army's lands remain viable to support future training and mission requirements indefinitely.  It integrates elements of operational, environmental, master planning, and other programs to identify and assess land use alternatives.  The ITAM Program thus supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions.  The ITAM program consists of four major elements:  (i) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA, (ii) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), (iii) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), (iv) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA).   <br> The Contractor shall support the aforementioned programs (depending upon the particular scope of the work contained in an individual Task Order) by conducting appropriate field surveys, field sampling, investigations, site visits, interviews, and literature searches; execute suitable studies; prepare satisfactory reports, prepare plans and specifications, perform on-going site monitoring, Geographic Information System support, imagery/drawings, cartographic mapping, and provide on-site support to assist in performing Sustainable Range Program (SRP) related tasks.  Any or all of the above may be required during the period of this contract.  Those work efforts described above may occur at any location described below. <br> There will be one (1) solicitation for the following geographical locations:  Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Slovenia.  Majority of the work is anticipated to be primarily in Germany. <br> Each project task order awarded under this contract shall normally be comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-packed tasks as described in each Task Order and the Unit Price Book. <br> The Award of this contract will be made on best value to the Government. Price and Technical factors will be considered. <br>  <br> a. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  <br> A base period of one (1) year and (3) three-year option periods. <br>  <br> b. MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE:  <br> It is anticipated $2,375,000.00 annually for the base period and 3 option years, not-to-exceed $9,500,000 for the entire life of the contract. <br>  <br> c. MINIMUM GUARANTEE:  <br> A single minimum guarantee amount of $5,000 covers the base period and any option period(s).  <br>  <br> d. TASK ORDER LIMITATIONS:  <br> The minimum task order is $2,500 and the maximum task order is $1,250,000 (reference clause 52.216-19).  On a case by case basis the Contracting Officer has the authority to issue task orders that may exceed the maximum task order limit. <br>  <br> A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to encourage early Contractor involvement. Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions related to this notice or the draft SOW no later than Tuesday 05 January 2014 to Contract Specialist Ian McClary at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer Frank Johnson at Frank.j.Johnson@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Purpose<br /><br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) , F-15 Division, Wright Patterson Air Force Base is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements of the F 15 Integrated Radio Controller (IRC) Program. This is not a request for proposals and responses will not be considered as a formal offer to the government nor result in a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
<p>Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. The intent of this notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the appropriate acquisition decision for the procurement. A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to full and open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers. This is not a request for proposals, and the Government will not pay for information received. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this Sources Sought. Any information provided in response to this RFI will be used for informational purposes only and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and what type of businesses will be used for subcontracting (other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought does not constitute a Request For Proposal or an Invitation for Bid. Sources Sought issuance does not restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>IRC Program Description<br /><br />The recent addition of Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability on the F 15C/D aircraft has produced additional requirements for the development of a radio/audio/cockpit management system that will enable the ability to monitor and transmit on three (3) simultaneous voice communication links, enhancing the Pilot Vehicle Interface (PVI) by providing a single location for radio control in the pilot's forward field of view. Under this effort, the design requirement for an IRC will provide the operator with interface and control of all legacy aircraft internal/external communications, navigation and aircraft warning systems. This includes radios, navigational aids (NAVAIDs), voice warnings, intercom, IFF Mode 3/A, Indentify Position (I/P) functions and other associated equipment. Further technical description is contained in the attached draft performance specification.<br /><br />Additional information can be found in the attachments, IRC Sources Sought Synopsis and IRC Specification.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement for market research purposes only, IAW FAR Part 10.  The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualification of businesses to compete and perform this requirement.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  Any prospective interested sources who anticipate competing for any resulting effort from this RFI will require access to Night Eagle technical data which is owned by the incumbent contractor, Leidos, CAGE Code 8A4GO, and which cannot be provided by the Government.    <br>  <br> The United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, anticipates a requirement for continued operation of the Night Eagle (NE) system which provides Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) for counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) support. The Night Eagle system was developed by the Air Systems Division (ASD) of Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) of the Army's Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  The Night Eagle system consists of two (2) Beechcraft C12/BE200 aircraft, two (2) ground stations, and up to 30 deployed personnel.  Additional system infrastructure consists of an aircraft maintenance shelter, CONEX containers and aircraft ground support equipment.   <br>  <br> Operation of the Night Eagle system includes providing aircraft, flight operations, pilots, logistics support, systems integration, Material and Equipment, Test and Evaluation, and Certification of aircraft and equipment.  Two primary levels of support required for this effort include flight operations and maintenance operations.  The Contractor will have to continue to furnish all required aircraft, personnel, training, documentation, material, equipment, tooling, property, facilities, and vehicles not provided as Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Spare Parts (GFSP), or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to perform this requirement to operate and maintain the fleet.  The Contractor will have to perform all required maintenance, servicing, repairs, electro static discharge practices and work on aircraft systems, components and Government Furnished Property (GFP) IAW 14 CFR/OEM/FAA, Army approved procedures and regulations.   <br>  <br> This services requirement will be accomplished with the existing Night Eagle systems. <br>  <br> Performance will take place primarily at deployed locations in Afghanistan.  Continental United States (CONUS) performance will take place at the contractor and subcontractor facilities, and Government testing sites, to include the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Fort AP Hill, Virginia; Fort Rucker, Alabama; Eglin Air Force Base, Florida and the Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.   <br> In support of the NE effort, NVESD will continue to develop, test and potentially deploy upgraded NE system components and new technologies to support the counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) effort.  Significant contractor support resources will be required to execute these efforts. <br>  <br> The contractor is required to have a facility clearance of TOP SECRET and SECRET level of safeguarding. All deployed contractor personnel shall have or obtain a SECRET level clearance prior to actual deployment.  Some deployed contractor personnel will require a TS/SCI security clearance. <br> The government anticipates that there are no vendors that are capable of performing uninterrupted OCONUS operations at the level provided by the incumbent contractor, Leidos, and their subcontractors.  Specific proprietary change detection software and unique material solutions may further limit competition, but all potential offerors should apply.  All interested inquiries will be considered. <br>  <br> Interested sources are requested to provide the following information: <br> 1.	Company name, CAGE code, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, and business size (if small, provide type of small business).  <br> 2.	Evidence of ability to operate and manage a requirement to support a U.S. Army Contractor Owned Contractor Operated (COCO) ISR Program. <br> 3.	Documentation demonstrating the ability to modify aircraft to integrate ISR equipment. <br> 4.	A brief description of the company's experience of modifying aircraft and integration of ISR equipment. <br> 5.	Identification of issues, concerns, or contingencies (if any) that might hinder the company from providing a firm-fixed-price, with cost reimbursable features proposal for the entire effort if requested to do so in a future Request for Proposals. <br> 6.	Identify your company's status in the Federal Government System for Award Management (SAM).  <br> 7.	Indicate your company's interest in bidding on a solicitation in support of this requirement, if it is issued. <br>  <br> All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting Command, ATTN: CCAM-AR-B/Matthew T. Copeland, 5304 Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898 or matthew.t.copeland2.civ@mail.mil and courtesy copied to Fixed Wing Project Management Office, ATTN: SFAE-AV-FW/Frederick L. Thompson (Acquisition Analyst), 650 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806, frederick.l.thompson.civ@amil.mil. Electronic email responses will be accepted. Your responses are required by 1600 CST  10 December 2014. This Sources Sought Announcement is not a solicitation for requests for proposal. No reimbursement shall be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Nothing shall be construed herein or through this announcement to commit or obligate the Government or the responders to further action as a result of this research. <br>

I.	Must provide a capability statement that addresses the organizations qualifications and ability to perform as a contractor for the work described below:
VA New York Harbor Healthcare System
Holter Monitor Scanning Services for the 
New York and Brooklyn Campuses
STATEMENT OF WORK
 
1.  Introduction and Scope of Work
Holter monitor scanning services shall be provided by the contractor, [insert name and address], to patients referred from the New York and Brooklyn Campuses of VA New York Harbor Healthcare System (VA NYHHS), 423 East 23rd Street, New York, NY 10010 and 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY  11209, for the period May 19, 2015 through May 18, 2016, plus four option years.
Patients are placed on digital cardiac-function monitoring devices (Holter monitors) for a 24-hour period so that the providers can utilize the data in diagnosing cardiovascular disorders.  VA nursing staff places the Holter monitors on patients at the Brooklyn and New York campuses.  Once patients return to the facility, nursing staff remove the monitors and place them in a dock and the patients' heartbeats for the entire 24-hour period are uploaded via a triple encrypted system to the contractor (note: the mechanism for electronically transmitting the data will depend on the vendor). The contractor is responsible for scanning all heart activity, highlighting, qualifying and quantifying events (e.g., tachycardia, ischemic events, blockage, etc.), and combining this information into a report describing regular and irregular cardiac patterns which is then electronically transmitted to the facility.  The electronic transmission of data is generally reliable; however, there are times when service is interrupted. This down-time can last minutes, hours or perhaps days.  In such instances, the vendor needs to provide technical support and/or another way for the data to be transmitted and for reports to be received. The contractor also provides the Holter monitors and equipment necessary to transmit the data and is responsible for the maintenance of the equipment, including replacing devices and equipment (e.g., lead wires) that are no longer functional.  VA NYHHS will be responsible for the repair or replacement of Holter monitor devices that are damaged while in the patient's possession, as well as docking stations and pouches that are damaged beyond normal wear and tear.
Currently, VA NYHHS does not have all the specialized resources (e.g., a trained technician, space, equipment, etc.) needed to perform Holter monitor scanning services.  To provide these services, a contract is necessary.   
2.	Requirements
A.	Services to be Provided/Data Exchange:
Upon removal of the digital Holter monitor from the patient, the monitor can be either placed in a dock and the data are securely transmitted to the contractor via software provided by the contractor or the flashcard in the Holter monitor can be connected to a card reader and the data are encrypted and transmitted to the contractor via a secure web portal.   Upon receipt of the data, the contractor scans the data, i.e., all heart activity for the 24-hour period, and identifies highlights, qualifies and quantifies events (e.g., tachycardia, ischemic events, blockage, etc.).   Scanning services entail:
"	Producing audio and visual representation of heart activity.
"	Analyzing data from the Holter monitors worn by patients for use in diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders. 
"	Adjusting scanner controls that regulate recorded sounds associated with heart activity and focus video representation of sounds on scanner screen. 
"	Observing scanner screen to identify irregularities in patient cardiac patterns, utilizing knowledge of regular and irregular cardiac-function patterns, or verifying data provided by computer program that automatically scans, analyzes and identifies irregular heart patterns. 
"	Recording sections of abnormal heart patterns or full disclosure of data for physician to do final analysis.  
"	Analyzing information from available patient diary to identify incidents that correspond to heart pattern irregularities detected on heart monitor. 
"	Recording findings on a report.
These events are to be compiled into a report describing the heart activity for the 24-hour period and sent back to the facility along with the scanned Holter data electronically via the provided software or web portal.  This software must allow users to easily identify information that has been sent back to the facility per patient thereby maximizing efficiency.  The Patient Care Team Coordinator (PCTC) for the Diagnostic Center (BK)/COR's designee provides the Chief, Cardiology Service Brooklyn Campus or his/her designee with the data and the report to review and analyze.   The information provided by the contractor will be sufficient for the VA providers to make cardiac diagnoses as appropriate.
B.	Reporting Requirements:
The digital Holter monitor data are transmitted electronically to the contractor and the report is returned to the facility using the web portal or software that was provided by vendor or and approved and authorized by the VA Office of Information and Technology (OI&T).  The reports are due back to the facility within 24-48 hours (business days) of transmittal.  The report that is returned to the facility will include:  patient demographic data, the indication for the test from the referring VA clinician, the EKG activity data for the 24-hour period, and the interpretation of the activity in the 24-hour period.  The report should also include any abnormalities observed while scanning that data.  The abnormalities that are identified in the data are compiled in an EKG strip for the VA cardiologists to review.  
C.	Workload Data:  
Between 5/19/14 and 1/31/15, 177 Holter monitor studies were performed, with a monthly average of 22 studies. It is anticipated that this volume will be maintained.  However, there is no minimum or maximum level of workload guaranteed under this contract.
D.	Facility Data: 
The contractor has no access to the VA computer system or software programs.  The contractor will not be given use of any government facilities, equipment, data or services.   The contractor will need to provide for the secure/encrypted electronic transmission of the data from NYHHS; any software or peripheral devices (e.g., card readers) that may need to be installed to enable this capability at NYHHS must be cleared for use by the VA's IT Office as well as the Privacy Officer.  A security background check of the company will need to be completed and found satisfactory.  The contractor will need to be prepared for this process to take approximately eight weeks.  The cost of the software and for time spent by contractor's personnel for installation at NYHHS will not be reimbursed.  No services can start until the transmission system is in place, tested, and found fully operational. 
E.	Place of Performance:
All services rendered by the contractor shall be performed on their premises using their own space, utilities, materials, and equipment.  
F.	Procedure for referral and scheduling: 
Patients are referred for Holter monitor placement by the VA clinician and are scheduled for holter placement by the staff in the Diagnostic Center at the Manhattan and Brooklyn Campuses of VA NYHHS.  The contractor is not involved in referring or scheduling patients for holter monitor placement.  Once the Holter monitor is removed from the patient the heart activity data are electronically transmitted to the contractor by the VA staff as described above.   The contractor does not interact with the patients directly.
G.	Transfer of Patients/Patient Safety:  
Not applicable; the contractor does not interact with the patients directly.
H.	Educational and research activities:
No educational or research activities are required or permitted under this contract.
I.	Billing/Payments:
On a monthly basis, the contractor is required to submit an invoice for all of the holter scans and reports completed in the previous month to the PCTC, Diagnostic Center (BK)/COR for review to
ensure that the work was completed.  The invoice includes the number of scans completed as well as a log of the names of the patients for who scans and reports were completed.  Any discrepancies are resolved in a timely manner by the COR and the contractor.  Once the invoice is reviewed and approved by the COR, the contractor submits it for payment using the appropriate method, e.g., submitting it online through the appropriate website or sending it to the VA's Financial Services center in Austin, TX for payment.  Only the VA shall be entitled to claim reimbursement from patients' health insurance for costs associated with the studies performed.  The contractor shall not make any third party claims but shall provide the documentation required by the VA to submit a claim.
J.	Reimbursement Method:
Reimbursement is for studies (i.e., Holter scans and reports) completed in a given month.  The rate is specified in the contract.  Payment occurs via direct deposit.
K.	Key Personnel: (CONTRACT TO LIST KEY PERSONNEL)
All scanning services as described in Section 2, Paragraphs A & B are performed by staff employed by the contractor.  Staff members providing services under this contract will need to meet requirements as set forth in the Special Requirements section.  The contractor shall inform the VA regarding any changes in personnel performing scanning services and is responsible for providing evidence of training, competency and any educational/credentialing and/or experience for those personnel.  Any licensed independent practitioners (e.g., physician) or licensed dependent providers (e.g., RN or technician)   employed by the contractor will be required to undergo the VA's credentialing and privileging process as appropriate and as set forth in the Special Requirements section.  Personnel performing scanning services or general supervision will have qualifications comparable to or exceeding those now performing those services.

3.  References  
None.

4.  Delivery - Delivery requirements are as stated above in the Requirements section.  

5.  Progress and Compliance
A.	The contractor is responsible for ensuring that all services provided by a physician, e.g., the licensed independent practitioner, or a registered nurse, e.g., licensed dependent provider, are within the scope of his/her privileges as determined by the Joint Commission-accredited organizations with which he/she is affiliated and/or the VA.
B.	The contractor is required to submit reports on patients' heart activity electronically to the facility within 24-48 hours (business days) of transmittal.  The timeliness of reports will be monitored by the PCTC, Diagnostic Center (BK)/COR. 
C.	Performance of the contractor's services will be monitored by the Chief, Cardiology at the Brooklyn Campus, or his/her designee and will consist of the following:
1.	Review of the quality of the reports that are returned to the facility to ensure that the reports include:
a.	Patient demographic data, the indication for the test from the referring VA clinician, the EKG activity data for the 24-hour period, and the interpretation of the activity in the 24-hour period.

b.	Any abnormalities observed while scanning that data.
c.	An EKG strip of the compiled abnormalities that are identified in the data for the VA cardiologists to review.
2.	Input on contractor performance by staff involved with the transmission and receipt of the reports.

D.	The Chiefs, Cardiology and/or their designees, the PCTC, Diagnostic Center/COR, the Associate Director for Patient Services/Chief Nurse Executive, as well as the Executive Chief of Staff and other facility managers, where necessary, in concert with the Government Contracting Officer, will provide input on steps to improve services in the event that contracted services do not meet expectations.  The Government Contracting Officer shall make the final determination of the validity of any customer complaints.

E.	Penalty for Non-Performance:
As described above, completed Holter scans and reports are to be returned to VA NYHHS within 24-48 hours after transmission of the data to the contractor.  The contractor must provide multiple ways of contacting them in the event of an emergency.  
If any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no additional cost to the Government.  Such cases will be discussed between the cardiologist or the Chief of Cardiology or his/her designee, and/or the COR, and the contractor to ensure that expectations in the re-performance are clear and appropriate.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:
1.	Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and
2.	Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.
Non-performance for reasons other than uncontrollable, unforeseeable events (e.g., extended power failures, acts of God), will be considered a breach of contract and procedures will be initiated to terminate the contract and seek out another contractor who can provide the same or similar services.
F.	Administrative aspects of the contractor's services will be monitored by the COR, who is designated as the PCTC, Diagnostic Center (BK).  The COR's monitoring will consist of validation that the scans billed were performed and that the necessary documentation has been entered into VistA/CPRS by VA staff.  The Government Contracting Officer shall make the final determination of the validity of any customer complaints.

b.  INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
(1)	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
(a)	A contractor/sub-contractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
(b)	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
(c)	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
(d)	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
(a)	
The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ.  The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
(2)	TRAINING
(b)	All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(c)	
i.	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
ii.	Successfully complete the VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
iii.	Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
iv.	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
(d)	The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.  
(e)	Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

Contractor may also be subject to other requirements in VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security, and Appendix C.

<DESC>The Preservation Directorate (PD) of Library Services within the Library of Congress (LOC) is conducting market research for deacidification treatment on a mass production level of library paper volumes and unbound paper sheets. Offerors may propose any deacidification process(es) providing the process meets the technical requirements specified in the SOW.  The Library invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI).<br />
<p>This RFI is being sought strictly for the purpose of gaining knowledge of services and supplies available in the commercial marketplace and comments on the attached Statement of Work.  This RFI should not be construed as intent, commitment, or promise to acquire services, supplies, or solutions offered.  No contract will result from any response to this RFI.  Please note that the actual solicitation is anticipated to be released sometime in Fiscal Year 2016.</p>
<p>PD anticipates awarding either an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm-Fixed-Price orders or a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract consisting of a base year and four option years.</p>
<p>PD seeks capability statements from all sources.<br />Capability Statement Instructions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statements are due by 12:00 noon on May 15, 2015. Responses should be submitted via FBO:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the PD hereby solicits capability statements from eligible contractors. These statements shall be no longer than 5 pages (single-spaced, with a minimum of one-inch margins and 12 point font). Appendix should be no longer than 25 pages.  Please address each requirement in the order provided below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contractors should include science demonstrably based on scientifically proven technical data, knowledge of the chemistry and physics involved and that can operate safely at full production and meet the toxicological and environmental standards set out in this solicitation. The science documentation of process which should include results from testing to document both positive and adverse limitations will not be counted as part of the 5 pages of the capability statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capability statement should describe the process and value of the treatment process, the expertise of key personnel, and the capability of the company to provide the necessary capacity for services as stated in the draft SOW and below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capability statement should describe the qualifications and experience of key personnel, as well as related corporate experience and capacity, in each of the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull;	Have extensive knowledge, and experience in successfully neutralizing the acid in paper-based materials both bound and in sheets and be able to scientifically demonstrate both the value of the process and low adverse effects on treated materials. <br />&bull;	Have the capacity to successfully treat bound and sheet materials yearly in a range of 100,000 to 200,000 volumes and 800,000 to1,000,000 sheets. <br />&bull;	Have experience working with organizations that have required successful treatment of library paper-based materials both bound and in sheets with successful test results that show process reduces the loss of strength by a factor of at least 3.0 without adverse side effects to the materials and provide documentation of successful treatment that both neutralizes acid and adds buffer.<br />&bull;	Have the capacity to provide on site at the Library of Congress contractor personnel to select, document, create item records if needed in the ILS, pack, ship and document return of items and return treated items to their original location. Also have the capacity to treat on site those sheets deemed too valuable to be shipped off site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix should include and not exceed 25 pages:</p>
<p>&bull;	Description of the deacidification chemistry, process, and existing and planned facilities owned or to be owned by the parties, as well as information on any toxicological or environmental impact of the process and/or any of the bi-products, and available data concerning the occupational safety of the process operation.<br />&bull;	Documentation of laboratory analyses on processed volumes and sheets from named current customers.  Analyses should include pH measurements; tests for alkaline reserve; completeness of deacidification, using scanning electron microscopy; and extension of life of the papers as measured by accelerated aging, and/or any other tests useful for establishing the effectiveness of the process.  <br />&bull;	Evaluation of volumes and sheet materials for any process-related damage(s) or other unacceptable side-effects on the treated materials, such as process-induced odors in treated materials; blocking, cockling, tearing, staining, discoloration, or yellowing of paper; bleeding or feathering of inks or others media; warping of binding boards; degradation and/or other chemical changes in book cloths, buckrams, or other covering materials; degradation of binding or other adhesives or damage to sewn or adhesive binding structures; loosening or damage to labels; excessive chemical deposits on covers, paper stock, photographic images or other non-porous materials such as coated or super-calendered paper; and damage to plastic components of volumes and other treated objects. <br />&bull;	Demonstrate processing turn-around times to determine whether volumes and other treated materials would be returned and refiled for use within a period of time that is deemed reasonable to the Library.  Even though a process has technical merit, the Library may choose not to evaluate and test it if, in addition to an acceptable time for selecting, shipping, treating, returning, and refiling the materials, the process requires, for example, several additional days of pre-drying and several days or weeks for rehumidifying, airing, or removing process-related odors from treated materials.  <br />&bull;	Demonstrate capability to treat on site of customers those sheets too valuable to be removed from customer premises.<br />&bull;	Provide available data on the effectiveness of the process in reducing the loss of strength of papers, providing complete deacidification, and depositing adequate, uniform permanent alkaline reserve.<br />&bull;	Cite any documentation of evaluations, analyses, and findings in a written report made available to the preservation community for their use in making preservation decisions.<br />&bull;	A list of customers that are using and/or other interested parties who are evaluating their deacidification services.</p>
<p>Please provide the following Business information:</p>
<p>1. DUNS Number<br />2. Company Name<br />3. Company Address<br />4. Company Point of Contact, phone number and email address<br />5. Corporate structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, professional corporation, etc.);<br />6.

<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the interest and feasibility of a small business set-aside for the following requirement: Identifying Program Components and Practices that Influence SNAP Application Processing Timeliness Rates. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor will the U.S. Government pay for information solicited.

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a procurement for the subject research study in Fiscal Year 2015 and is seeking statements of capability from potential offerors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in their capability statement.</p>
<p>FNS is seeking a contractor to conduct a study that will examine States' varying program and policy options, workflow, business processes, and other features to identify the program elements and practices that facilitate high APT rates. The study will include a survey of all 50 States and the District of Columbia as well as a review of program administrative data, including administrative and demonstration project waivers. In addition, the study will include a review of reports from studies done by FNS on this issue.<br /><br />Only electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted and should be emailed to: Ashley.Owens@fns.usda.gov.

A determination by the Government to proceed with the acquisition as a set-aside is within the discretion of the Government. If capability statements are not received from at least two responsible small businesses or if the Government determines that no small business concerns are capable of performing this requirement based upon an assessment of the capability statements submitted, the Government may proceed with a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Please submit all information to Ashley Owens at Ashley.Owens@fns.usda.gov no later than May 15, 2015 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<CONTACT>Terence G. Lord, Email lordtg@state.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis whose only purpose is in support of market research.  <strong>Only responses from current holders of a small business GSA IT Schedule 70 contract will be evaluated.</strong>
<p><br />The Department of State's Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) is seeking support for its State Administrative Services (SAS) requirement.  This will be a highly complex action with new computer platforms, significant upgrades and new and expansive requirements for development skill.  The current staffing at three U.S. Government locations is approximately 100 employees.  All are located in the Greater Metropolitan Washington, DC Area with some staff located at vendor sites and a small number of teleworkers.</p>
<p><br />The requirement is to provide information technology project support and software engineering in support of administrative, enterprise-wide applications for the State Administrative Services (SAS) applications for the U.S. Department of State (DoS).    These include, but are not limited to human resources, general services operations, administrative support, data/records, overseas allowances, compensation, business processes, project management, budget, and finance and building applications.</p>
<p><br />The US Department of State relies on up-to-date, accurate data to fulfill business requirements and support management decision making.  This data is collected through software applications and electronic forms. While the use of Microsoft InfoPath is emerging as one standard for forms, most standard forms for the Department are maintained in Cerenade eForms. In addition to the use of electronic forms, the Department currently receives data from a number of administrative software applications.  Many applications are currently written in Java and utilize Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) Server.  Others are written in the .Net framework.  However, the Department may require future enhancements using other technologies approved by the Department's Information Technology Configuration Control Board (ITCCB).</p>
<p><br />These applications support the business requirements of several bureaus including the Bureau of Administration (A), Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS), Human Resources (HR) and Overseas Building Operations (OBO).  These bureaus and others require project support to maintain and enhance the current data collection, processing and reporting requirements as they are performed through the use of electronic forms and software applications.  Prior support for federal agencies is preferred.<br /> <br /><strong>It is anticipated that any resulting contract/order will require a Facility Clearance at the SECRET level.</strong><br /><br />Response to this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSP) is not considered an offer and cannot/will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.<br />Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is voluntary. This Sources Sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any Government assessments.</p>
<p><br />The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. The Government's evaluation of the Capabilities Package received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open unrestricted competition, a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g., HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, SDB, etc.).<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Should your firm be interested in this requirement, please only electronically submit your company's Capabilities Package data in no more than 15 pages of 8.5" X 11", using at least 10 point font with 1 inch margins, and pages numbered consecutively.</span></em></strong></p>

<CONTACT>Josh McClead, Email purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Fiscal Service on behalf of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Adminstration (TIGTA) is contracting to acquire Western Telematic Inc Secure Console Servers. This requisition will be non-competitive under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.
<p>Intended Source: Western Telematic Inc.<br />DUNS: 041681362</p>
<p>The Agency has been using the WTI product for over ten years and following the replacement models. A competitive product was introduced but it was determined that the competitive product did not work in the environment, both in management and operational tasks. The Agency currently has about 25% of the office populations fulfilled with the WTI product. Changing the brand product would require new standardization and testing to ensure full functionality, while losing the 25% already installed product. The time needed and loss for this process would significantly impact mission critical functions, as this is a required equipment replacement. Purchasing the additional WTI product provides the necessary continuity of operation and compatibility with our current system. It is not practical or compatible to mix in a different company's products with what we currently have in place. This product is manufactured and sold only by Western Telematic, Inc. and is not offered elsewhere.</p>
NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 1500 (3:00pm ET) May 6, 2015. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: JMCCLEAD - SS-TGT-15-0046. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested requirement. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to Western Telematic, Inc.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.</p>
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Agilent Technologies Incorporated, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Agilent Technologies Incorporated, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808 for two Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometers.</p>
<p>The FBI Explosive Unit (EU) is executing a joint improvised explosives research effort with the Department of Homeland Security. The EU's overall goal of the research is to thoroughly characterize synthesized explosive materials. This includes measuring the optical properties of the materials. The optical properties of a material not only round out the full molecular characterization of a material, but the information is essential for development of standoff detection technologies. A high resolution, wide range spectrophotometer, such as an Ultraviolet Visible Near Infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer is the only way to accurately and precisely measure the optical properties.</p>
<p>The FBI must have the ability to directly and accurately measure the UV-Vis-NIR properties of an explosive formulation. In order to accomplish this requirement and to properly measure this essential parameter, the Agilent Technologies Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR is the only spectrophotometer that will meet all of the FBI requirements listed below:</p>
<p>&bull; The system must measure the sample absorbance in both diffuse reflectance and transmission modes;<br />&bull; The system must allow analysis of liquid and solid samples using the appropriate accessories;<br />&bull; System must have a wavelength range of 175-3300nm;<br />&bull; System must use a double out-of-plane Littrow monochromator;<br />&bull; System must use a UV-V that is grating with 1200 lines/mm blazed at 250nm and a NIR grating with 300 lines/mm blazed at 1192nm;<br />&bull; The system must have a rotating beam splitter which measures a sample, dark, and reference signal per cycle with a speed of 30Hz;<br />&bull; System must cover the specified wavelength range sufficiently with no more than two detectors; Photomultiplier tube for UV-Vis and a cooled PbS detector for NIR;<br />&bull; System must have a limiting resolution of less than 0.048nm UV-Vis and 0.2nm NIR;<br />&bull; System must have low stray light transmittance, specifically less than 0.00007% at 220nm (10g/L Nal ASM method) and 0.00045% at 2365nm (CHCI&#1249;, 1cm pathlength) and equivalent in between the ranges;<br />&bull; System must have a wavelength accuracy measured by lamp lines of &plusmn;0.08nm in the range 190-900nm and &plusmn;0.4nm in the range 760-3000nm;<br />&bull; System must have high wavelength reproducibility demonstrated by peak separation of less than 0.025nm of repetitive screening of a UV-V is line source and less than 0.1nm for a NIR line source;<br />&bull; System must have a standard deviation of less than 0.005nm, UV-Vis and 0.02nm NIR for 10 measurements of a repetitive scanning;<br />&bull; The system must have high photometric accuracy demonstrated by less than 0.000025 ABd using the double aperture method at 0.3 Abs for UV-Vis;<br />&bull; The system must have a photometric range of 8 Abs with RBA;<br />&bull; The system must have a large sample compartment at least 160 x 433 x 221nm in size with beam separation of at least 190.5nm and access from the top, front, and base;<br />&bull; The instrument must be no more than 1020 x 710 x 380 mm in size not including attachments;<br />&bull; System must have a spectral bandwidth of at least 0.01nm and at most 5nm in the UV-Vis at a minimum of 0.01nm steps and at least 0.04nm and at most 20nm for NIR;<br />&bull; System must be able to signal average between 0.033 to 999s;<br />&bull; System must have a scan rate equal to or more than 2000nm/min in the UV-Vis and 8000nm/min in the NIR;<br />&bull; System must be able purge both the sample compartment and optics separately;<br />&bull; The system must include an attachment to measure reflectance of a solid material mounted horizontally without purchasing additional detectors;<br />&bull; Vendor must provide on-site setup and developmental support;<br />&bull; System must come with operational and user definable software.</p>
<p>Agilent Technologies Incorporated is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, therefore is the only vendor that can meet all the requirements of the FBI. <br /><br />Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Agilent Technologies Incorporated as they are the sole-manufacturer and supplier of the Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, May 05, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<CONTACT>TAPP, MARK
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Southeast Region, intends to award on a single source basis a contract to Martino Enterprises for the use of Refuge property in connection with the operation of a concession at the Henry County (County), Tennessee, Mansard Island Marina. The concession operation involves:

A.	 The sales of approved sport fishing supplies, including Tennessee hunting and fishing licenses, artificial and live bait(s), as well as outdoor gear, souvenirs, food, and beverages, etc.
B.	Rental of Jon boats and pontoon boats.

Upon request by the concessionaire and approval by the Refuge Manager the following public services may also be authorized:

A.	Rental of boats, outboard motors and battery powered trolling motors.
B.	Food and beer.
C.	Collection of boat launch fees.

Justification for non-competition of this requirement:
 
Martino Enterprises owns all infrastructures immediately adjacent to the refuge property.  This includes duplex style lodging, campground, hotel lodging, pool, playground equipment, and maintenance facilities that support the marina.  Since the refuge property adjoins the property owned by Martino Enterprises, it would not be possible for another vendor to operate a marina at this location.
  
Inquiries concerning this concession operation may be submitted in writing to the following:

Mark Tapp
US Fish and Wildlife Service
Southeast Region
Division of Contracting and Grant Services
1875 Century Blvd., Suite 310
Atlanta, GA 30345
Email: mark_tapp@fws.gov

All inquiries must be received by the USFWS by 11:00 am (EST), 14 May, 2015.

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Casting Splints. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Casting Splints products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Casting Splints. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.</p>
<p>The QSL for Casting Splints will be established approximately October 2015 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately November 2015 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Casting Splints. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Casting Splints.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Casting Splints. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $586,412. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eight items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 76.96% ($451,343) of the total volume in sales ($586,412). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below.

Send protests (other than protests to the contracting officer) to: ? Address: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 ? Fax: (256) 450-8840 ?

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 Employees
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the Special Test Program in accordance with FAR Part 13. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and Division of Intermural Research Program (IRP) has a requirement to procure a preventative and maintenance service agreement for laboratory equipment used for research.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIDDK Acquisitions Branch, Louis Stokes Laboratories has a need to acquire a new Infrared Imaging System for use in performing screenings and analysis of Western Blot Gels. In order to continue research a new system is needed. To save the cost of expenditures required to maintain an infrastructure for film-based imaging techniques and procedures, acquisition of a digital imaging system is desired. This new system must be able to perform the following tasks.</p>
<p>&bull; Must be able to perform multiple screening of knockout cell lines.<br />&bull; Must be able to study post-translational modifications for proteins.<br />&bull; Must have a system that features a linear range that will allow us to perform <br />more accurate quantifications.<br />&bull; Must have the ability to simultaneously detect two proteins in the same <br />experiment.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />Performance Work Statment<br />Leadership Training Materials<br />1. 0 General</p>
<p>1.1 Scope<br />The contractor shall provide leadership training materials to be used by USCG instructors for leadership courses and workshops for students.</p>
<p>1.2 Background</p>
<p>Established in 1998, the Leadership Development Center (LDC) creates an educational center of leadership excellence for the entire Coast Guard. Over 5,000 students per year attend over 20 college accredited courses through the American Council of Education at the following divisions:<br />&bull; Chief Petty Officer Academy<br />&bull; Command and Operations<br />&bull; Leadership and Organizational Performance<br />&bull; Officer Accessions and Transition<br />With detachments in Yorktown, Virginia, and Petaluma, California, the LDC is co-located with the United States Coast Guard Academy on the Thames River in New London, Connecticut. The LDC reaches out to active duty enlisted, officer, officer candidate, cadet, reserve, civilian, and auxiliary members of the Coast Guard through resident and non-resident classroom training, unit level programs, and web-based programs. These delivery strategies combine to facilitate leadership development, which translates to enhanced mission performance and increased retention. In our mission-focused service, we must take the time to invest in our people and work to establish the positive command climate that will serve as a force multiplier to ensure mission success.</p>
<p>The following are example of the LDC's instructional programs:</p>
<p>The Aligned Enlisted Continuum: The Enlisted Leadership Continuum is a progression of leadership training from junior to senior enlisted in the Coast Guard. The continuum is based in a foundation of six central themes that are revisited and explored in more depth at each consecutive level. These six themes are: Personality Diversity, Influencing Others, Leadership Tactics, Team Effectiveness, Values, and Performance Management. These central themes are also found in Officer Accession courses, Command and Operations courses, and Coast Guard Auxiliary courses. It is the LDC's vision to unify the different aspects of leadership training across the Coast Guard so that the common language of leadership is familiar and applicable no matter when and where you serve. This Statement of Work specifically addresses the Leadership Tactics core model.</p>
<p>Leadership Courses: Below are descriptions of leadership courses offered by the LDC. All of these courses meet a prescribed need for leadership at varying levels within the Coast Guard and are managed by the Office of Leadership (CG-12C). All of these courses contain Terminal Performance Objectives (TPOs) for a leadership tactics model with the end goal of enabling members to recognize and employ variable leadership tactics that match the needs of the situation.</p>
<p>&bull; Leadership and Management School (LAMS): a one-week continuum course designed to enhance supervisory skills for first-line supervisors through an experience-based curriculum. LAMS is required for advancement from Second Class Petty Officer (E-5) to First Class Petty Officer (E-6); approximately 1400 students a year.<br />&bull; Apprentice Leadership Program (ALP): a 3-day course intended to provide A-school students with basic leadership instruction, with emphasis on the "leading self" competencies of the Coast Guard Leadership Development Framework. Approximately 3000 non-rated members (E-3) receive ALP every year.<br />&bull; Chief Petty Officer Academy (CPOA): The Commandant and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard have both identified the transition from First Class Petty Officer (E-6) to Chief Petty Officer (E-7) as the most critical in the Coast Guard enlisted career. The CPOA experience has been carefully designed to provide students with the skills, knowledge, and attitude to make this transition as smoothly and effectively as possible. Our graduates are ready to become the Coast Guard's Chief Petty Officer Corps: the backbone of the enlisted workforce. Approximately 550 Chiefs attend CPOA a year.<br />Senior Enlisted Leadership Course (SELC): a two-week course focused on creating a pool of highly trained and motivated senior enlisted leaders better prepared for assignment to a Master Chief or Senior Chief Petty Officer billet including select high-profile assignments, such as Command Master Chief and Rating Force Master Chief. Using the U.S. Coast Guard's Leadership Development Framework, SELC develops critical leadership skills required of Senior Enlisted Leadership positions by addressing human resource and organizational policies, professional communications, the relationships between workforce and senior leadership, and concepts of strategy and organizational change management. Approximately 75 students a year graduate SELC.<br />&bull; Officer Candidate School (OCS): an extensive 17-week course of instruction which prepares officer candidates to serve effectively as officers of the United States Coast Guard. In addition to introducing students to the military lifestyle, OCS provides a vast curriculum covering topics that are essential for performing the duties of a Coast Guard Officer. Graduates of the program receive a commission in the Coast Guard as an Ensign. Approximately 140 students a year graduate OCS.<br />&bull; Coast Guard Auxiliary Leadership and Management School (AUXLAMS): the LAMS course, adapted for the volunteer Auxiliary environment, taught by Coast Guard trained instructors. It is based on the Leadership Competencies, which lay the foundation for all leadership skills necessary to successful leadership in the Coast Guard and the Auxiliary. AUXLAMS is the foundation course of the Auxiliary Leadership Continuum. Approximately 300 students a year attend this course.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>After a half-century of intractable violence resulting in 6 million victims (including over 4 million displaced), Colombia may be nearing an end to its fifty-year internal armed conflict. Ongoing negotiations between the Government of Colombia (GOC) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) continue to advance in Havana, Cuba. According to polls, the mood of the country towards a peace accord is moderately supportive but significant sectors of the population remain skeptical, including the Democratic Center party and its principal public figure, former President Uribe. If an agreement is concluded in Havana, the Colombian public will need to approve it in a referendum or other form of public consultation for it to be binding.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether an agreement is reached, growing evidence suggests that Colombia is already on a path out of conflict toward greater stability and development. The GOC has already begun the transition to peace by addressing both the root causes and social consequences of 50 years of conflict. Over the past three years, the GOC has launched an ambitious set of social and economic programs (many developed with USAID support) that signify a sharp break from centuries of neglect of the more remote regions of the country. There have been advancements on reconciliation, land, and reintegration. A critical step towards reconciliation was achieved in 2011 with the passage of Colombia's Victims and Land Restitution Law. This landmark legislation addresses the needs of conflict victims through comprehensive reparations, land restitution, truth telling, and psycho-social support.<br /> <br />The Colombian government has asked the international community for support, whether or not accords are signed, to implement reforms that will address the legacy and causes of conflict. The United States Government (USG) has worked closely with Colombia since increases in aid in the 90s, and the country remains a critical US ally in the region. Colombia is an active partner in the US fight against trans-national criminal networks, a co-provider of technical assistance to other countries in the hemisphere and a key trade partner. The USG has clearly stated its support for the Havana negotiations and is planning to assist in the implementation of any agreement that may result from the talks.</p>
<p>The USAID Mission has a well-rounded, strategically relevant portfolio that addresses the mid and long term needs that sustainable peace requires. It includes victims' reparations, land reform, climate change and environmental degradation mitigation, improved economic opportunities, political participation, royalties' management, human rights, and other areas. The USAID/Colombia program will complement the Mission's ongoing programs by focusing on shorter-term aspects to the reform process required for sustainable peace.  The initial anticipated objective is to strengthen the Colombian government's institutional capacity to ensure regional and local participation in peacebuilding.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of OTI's Colombia program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials. This position requires excellent managerial (project and personnel) and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly-sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation, an understanding of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships, and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.<br /> <br />Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions including budget preparation, financial management, records management, and travel assistance, to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the OTI Country Representative to develop an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the U.S. Embassy, bilateral donors, United Nations organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>While in Colombia, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 335312 with the related size standard of 500 employees. The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items with optional period of performance that extends beyond the base term. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Cat6 Cables/Installation for Wood National Cemetery 
VA118-15-Q-0159
Questions and Answers- Amendment A00001

1. Question:  In the advertisement/notice there is an equipment listing that seems to detail exactly what equipment we would be required to supply. However, in the network cabling specifications document it details building interconnects using fiber. Is there any fiber work or is this simply miscellaneous information not intended to reflect actual work to be performed in service of the contract?  
Answer:   There is no fiber work associated with this solicitation.  The hardware requirements are set forth in the Product Description, and we ask that the work be done in accordance with Attachment A's Specifications.  The "specifications" document contains both Cat6 and Fiber cabling specifications.  For purposes of this solicitation, we have only requested Cat6 cabling so please conform only to those requirements in the CAT6 section of Attachment A.

2. Question:  Is there a floor plan for the solicitation VA118-15-Q-0159? For the material requested in the solicitation, is there a specific brand of material you prefer? Can the proposal due date be extended from May 4, 2015?  

Answer:  The Government does not have a floor plan for SolicitationVA11815-Q-0159.  Regarding the material requested in the solicitation, a specific brand is not preferred.  However, there are two items with APC part numbers or equivalent.  Additionally, the proposal due date will be extended until May 6, 2015, 3:00pm, EST.

**Please note Offeror's are instructed to complete Section B.3 and submit with their quote. Offeror's are cautioned that alterations to the line items identified in Section B.3 will not be accepted, and will render quotes unacceptable.**

<DESC>This is a MARKET SURVEY requesting information in support of the following potential requirement. No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.   <br>   The intent of the market survey is to gather information to assess the potential for Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFVs) to integrate technologies and, or Underbelly (UB) kitted solutions, onto the existing platform that will meet a set of defined and measureable requirements.  These technologies or a potential kitted solution design should demonstrate the ability to be modular and easily integrated onto the BFVs.  Impact on force protection verified through appropriate tools and techniques such as modeling and simulation and test, affordability, minimal weight not to exceed 4,100 pounds for entire kit, ease of integration, ease of installation and concept maturity are key attributes.  It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated as a kit to provide a synergistic protective effect on the BFV Platform. <br>  <br> ********UBIS Inquiry LogBook is now available*********** <br> Please note that all questions and answers will be posted anonymously to this website. The cut-off date for the Question and Answer period will be 22MAY2015. Questions that are received by this office after the deadline will be considered late and may not be answered.  <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Edgewood Contracting Division (ECD), on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), by and through the Joint Product Manager CBRNE Analytics and Response Systems (JPdM CBRNE A&RS) within the Joint Program Manager Guardian (JPMG), intends to competitively solicit proposals, on a full and open basis, for the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) Phase of the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) program.  Specifically, the CALS EMD effort will involve designing, developing, fabricating, integrating, and testing the CALS in multiple configurations in accordance with (IAW) the CALS System Performance Specification (SPS) and this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The estimated period of performance for the CALS EMD effort is 3.5 years.  The solicitation will contain multiple contract types and options in order to most efficiently execute the CALS EMD effort.  Specifically, all Non-Recurring Engineering, Test Support, Logistics, ect. will be completed on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee basis.  Initial CALS components will be procured via a Firm Fixed Price contract type.  The individual CALS configurations will be procured via Fixed Price Incentive options.  The below provides additional information on CALS and estimated quantities for each configuration.  <br>    <br>  CALS integrates a common suite of commercial- and government-off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of CBR materials in environmental samples.  The CALS program will develop and field two integrated system configurations to support an array of CBR missions for DoD field analytic units.  Each configuration will support either field confirmation- or theater validation-level environmental CBR analysis.    The configurations will be developed using modular open systems architectures (MOSA), and include:  <br>    <br>  Field Confirmatory Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).  Supports tactical decisions in the field regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates common CBR capabilities into a common 20-foot ISO container.  <br>    <br>  Analytical Capability Set Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 4 each).   A palletized/transportable configuration.  This transportable configuration enables end users to receive the CBR subsystems that meet their specific mission profiles, while also enabling CBR subsystems to operate in a range of user-provided laboratory enclosures/shelters.   <br>    <br>  Theater Validation Configuration (Estimated Quantity: 2 each).  Similar to the Field Confirmatory Configuration, but provides an expanded CBR capability and higher degree of confidence in the analytical results.  Analysis from the Theater Validation Variant provides additional critical information to support timely and effective operational-level decisions regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures.  The system integrates an expanded CBR capability into a set of 20-foot ISO containers.  <br>    <br>  Interested parties are advised that certain documentation pertaining to the CALS effort is export controlled and as such, access to this documentation will be restricted utilizing the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Interested parties will need valid contractor login credentials to access this information once it has been posted.  <br>    <br>  The CALS EMD effort will be solicited on a full and open competition basis and will utilize a best value trade-off approach.  It is estimated that solicitation W911SR-14-R-0002 will be issued for the CALS EMD effort in June or July 2014.   <br>    <br>  The point of contact for this effort is Ms. Suzanne M. Drake, Contract Specialist.  All inquiries should be directed to suzanne.m.drake2.civ@mail.mil. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  <br>    <br>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement for market research purposes only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.   <br>  <br> The United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, anticipates a requirement for continued operation of the Night Eagle (NE) system which provides Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) for counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) support. The Night Eagle system was developed by the Air Systems Division (ASD) of Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) of the Army's Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  This requirement addresses the continued support of the deployed NE system which consists of two highly modified aircraft and associated sensor/communication systems, two ground stations, one CONUS based processing center, a CONUS system integration laboratory, a CONUS training facility and up to 30 continuously deployed personnel with SECRET or higher security clearances. Additional system infrastructure consists of an aircraft shelter, CONEX containers and aircraft ground support equipment. The Night Eagle aircraft are contractor owned and operated. Any interested parties would be required to provide all of the necessary equipment, personnel and technical/logistical support to continue without any interruption in ongoing OCONUS counter-IED operations. Night Eagle prime mission equipment is Government owned, however, there are multiple software configuration items for which the Government does not have data rights.  <br>  <br> Operation of the Night Eagle system includes providing aircraft, flight operations, pilots, logistics support, systems integration, Material and Equipment, Test and Evaluation, and Certification of aircraft and equipment.  Two primary levels of support required for this effort include flight operations and maintenance operations.  The Contractor will continue to furnish all required aircraft, personnel, training, documentation, material, equipment, tooling, property, facilities, and vehicles not provided as Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Spare Parts (GFSP), or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to perform this contract to operate and maintain the fleet.  The Contractor will continue to perform all required maintenance, servicing, repairs, electro static discharge practices and work on aircraft systems, components and Government Furnished Property (GFP) IAW 14 CFR/OEM/FAA, Army approved procedures and regulations.   <br>  <br> This services requirement will be accomplished with the existing Night Eagle systems. <br>  <br> Performance will take place primarily at deployed locations in USCENTCOM or USAFRICOM Areas of Responsibility (AORs).  Continental United States (CONUS) performance will take place at the contractor and subcontractor facilities, and Government testing sites, to include:   Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, Fort Eustis, Virginia and Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.   <br> In support of the NE effort, the Fixed Wing Project Office (FWPO), in conjunction with NVESD, will continue to develop, test and potentially deploy upgraded NE system components and new technologies to support the counter IED effort.  Significant contractor support resources will be required to execute these efforts. <br>  <br> The contractor is required to have a facility clearance of TOP SECRET and SECRET level of safeguarding. All deployed contractor personnel shall have or obtain a SECRET level clearance prior to actual deployment.  Select contractor personnel will require a TS/SCI security clearance. <br>  <br> This anticipated contract will be a follow-on to an existing contract in the FY17 timeframe for the continued provision of a highly specialized service and it is likely that award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and that competing this effort would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Army's requirements as provided by the incumbent contractor, Leidos, CAGE Code 5UTE0, and their subcontractors.  Specific proprietary Change detection software and unique material solutions may further limit competition, but all potential offerors should apply.  Justification of capabilities will be required at time of proposal with material solutions in hand and not in development.  No Government Furnished Equipment or material will be supplied to a vendor to support replies to this RFI.  The Night Eagle system(s) will not be available to support a solution proposed in reply to this RFI. If your firm believes it can satisfy this requirement based on the conditions identified above, reply to this announcement with the rationale to allow your firm to be included in the anticipated RFP.  All interested inquiries will be considered. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that any resultant contracting action in support of this requirement will be contracted for using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Negotiation.  <br>  <br> Interested sources are requested to provide the following information: <br> 1.	Company name, CAGE code, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, and business size (if small, provide type of small business).  <br> 2.	Has your company performed this type of effort or similar type effort (to include size and complexity) in the past?  If so provide Contract Number, Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number and a brief description of your direct support of the effort. <br> 3.	Documentation demonstrating the ability to modify aircraft to integrate ISR equipment. <br> 4.	A brief description of the company's experience of modifying aircraft and integration of ISR equipment. <br> 5.	Identification of issues, concerns, or contingencies (if any) that might hinder the company from providing a firm-fixed-price, with cost reimbursable features proposal for the entire effort if requested to do so in a future Request for Proposals. <br> 6.	Identify your company's status in the Federal Government System for Award Management (SAM).  <br> 7.	Do you plan to prime? Describe how you will either produce or subcontract for services required.  Does your company possess the capabilities to provide the entire range of services called for in the above task list? <br> 8.	If you answered YES to Question #7, please provide specific capabilities and examples of how your company can provide these services.  If you answered NO to question #7, please list what services in the RFI your company can provide.  Please provide specific capabilities and examples. <br> 9.	Please provide details regarding proposed joint ventures, teaming arrangements, strategic alliances, or other business arrangements to satisfy requirements of the effort.  Offerors are encouraged to identify teams, indicating each team member's size based upon the NAICS code of the work that team member may be doing. <br> 10.	What are the core competencies of your employees that would support the requirements of the effort? Also, provide the total number of individuals currently employed by your company that are capable of supporting the requirements in the effort. <br> 11.	Do all the employees that would support this effort have a SECRET Clearance or higher? <br> 12.	Briefly describe your company's plan to assume control and operate the existing Night Eagle system (air and ground components) without any impact to ongoing deployed operations. <br> 13.	Briefly describe your company's plan to provide logistics support to the existing Night Eagle aircraft, sensor systems, communication systems, data links, aircraft survival system, etc so as to maintain a daily operational availability rate of 85% or greater. <br> 14.	Describe your company's plan to acquire, train and maintain Night Eagle personnel to operate existing Night Eagle aircraft, mission systems, and ground processing/exploitation/dissemination equipment. <br> 15.

This is proposed to be a FAR Part 12 effort. <br /><br />A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The NSNs on the attached list are the items for this current action.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation.

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought Succeeding Lease - Dawson County, Nebraska
<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Lexington, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately&nbsp;4480 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4110 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 8/1/2015.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 27 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 3 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent - NPS Total Recall Sys
<SOLNBR>P15PS01066
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>SESSOMS, ROSELYN D
<DESC>The National Park Service, Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island and United States Park Police (USPP) have a requirement for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras.  The purchase of additional cameras will enhance the core system at key locations around the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.  This is critical to visitor safety and will improve loss prevention capabilities within the park.

The estimated cost for this requirement is estimated to be $538,000 over a five year term.

The requirement will be acquired in the absence of competition in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1
-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 
 41 USC 253(c)(1).

The purchase and installation of the CCTV cameras on Ellis Island is required to be delivered , installed and fully integrated by September 15, 2015.  The supply and install requirement is to purchase rugged, exterior-type PTZ and fixed HD pixel cameras which are to be fully integrated into the parks current CCTV system.   Specific characteristics of the purchase, installation and integration that limit availability to a sole source are the technologies behind the system design and integration.  The current CCTV system was received as a donation from Total Recall Corporation (TRC).  The system donation was approved by NPS Director, Jonathan B. Jarvis on September 14, 2012.  The donation valued at $4.3 million, of which $2.4 million represents a ten (10) year comprehensive maintenance and service agreement.   The components of this CCTV system are highly technical, mounted in historically sensitive, secure and inaccessible locations and are prone to failure when exposed to the harsh environment and salt air at Liberty Island. 

No other party has access to the contractors proprietary system .  Should a third party contractor add hardware and software to the system, Total Recall Corporation would discontinue the maintenance and service agreement, thereby voiding the existing  warranty for the current CCTV system. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and a solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this requirement would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this posting must be submitted via email with the email subject Capability Statement and Proof of Accreditation for Total Recall  RESPONSES DUE NOT LATER THAN 2 May 2015 by 2:00 PM EST to National Park Service  NPNH-MABO to Roselyn Sessoms at Roselyn_sessoms@nps.gov.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (FFP-IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of three years. This effort will ensure office furniture matches, interconnects with, and is compatible with existing furniture systems. Office furniture includes typical workstations for systems furniture, modular furniture, executive furniture, conference room furniture, lobby and seating area furniture, and chairs.
<p>The furniture shall be in compliance with the ANSI/BIFMA, UL, ASTM, NFPA, EIA, and the Performance Work Statement (PWS) standards. Feature components, work surfaces, and storage units can be panel hung, freestanding or mobile allowing them to be used with panels in an open environment and allows for the same components, work surface, and storage units to be moved into private office workspaces to be used as freestanding or mobile furniture. All furniture in open areas and enclosed offices shall be from the same manufacturer (Steelcase) from within the same product series. Ancillary items shall be compatible and interchangeable for future reconfiguration purposes. Components shall align together properly in position and shall have excellent uniformity in product quality.</p>
<p>Furniture appearance shall match and coordinate with a variety of environments. The colors, patterns, materials, finishes, and fabrics shall maintain an aesthetic appeal that integrates design, craftsmanship, and function. Furniture appearance shall be suited for smooth transitions from open plan workstations to private offices to collaborative areas. Design and construction closely aligns with project needs and is visually appealing. Furniture shall be easily disassembled by in-house staff with some basic but simple instructions and tools. Reconfigurations are simple to perform with minimal parts discarded and added. When ordering furniture, the Government will use a three step process as follows: Step 1 is for the design layout work, space planning, interior consultation, drawings, calculations, specifications, and cost estimate to meet the customer's requirements.</p>
<p>Step 2 is for the ordering of furniture pieces and required parts according to the contractor furnished parts list, design and installation drawings as approved by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). Step 3 is for services to install the new furniture according to the design and installation drawings, and to support each project until completion.</p>

<DESC>A construction contract will be issued for repair and painting of seven (7) Tainter Gates, one (1) bulkhead lifting beam, and other miscellaneous appurtenant metal components&nbsp;at Cheatham Dam located on the Cumberland River near Ashland City, TN. <br /><br />The Tainter Gates are 27'x60' gates with skin plate on the Upstream and Downstream face. All seven gates have similar deterioration and will require replacement of a substantial number of bolts and rivets, replacement of all side seals (rubber), member replacement in the lower section of the gate, installation of an access hatch on the top of the gate, straightening or build-up of the lower seal and other miscellaneous metal repairs. Currently the interior of the gates are coated with coal tar epoxy and the exterior with a vinyl paint system. All structural components have been tested for lead based paint and positive results were attained on numerous components. Hence the contractor shall plan for hazardous waste removal and disposal. The gates will be repainted with similar paint systems. <br /><br />The spillway bulkhead lifting beam will require member straightening, minor welding, and bolt replacement. The spillway bulkhead lifting beam shall be blasted and repainted with a vinyl paint system similar to the exterior of the Tainter Gates. <br /><br />All work will be performed on-site. Government furnished spillway bulkheads shall be placed upstream and downstream of the Tainter Gates for the duration of the repair and painting operations. Placement of the spillway bulkheads will require marine plant and will be the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor may be required to install downstream bulkhead seal angles via the use of divers. The existing spillway bulkheads allow for unwatering of one gate bay only. A second set of spillway bulkheads will be procured by the Government outside of this contract and will be available to the construction contractor in 2016. <br /><br />River conditions fluctuate substantially at Cheatham Dam and the contractor may encounter periods of shutdown and / or demobilization. The construction season for this contract is from June 1 to November 30 (6 months). It is expected that all work can be performed in 3.5 construction seasons. The estimated length of the contract is&nbsp;42 months. <br /><br />A low price technically acceptable (LPTA) type acquisition is planned with four (4) evaluation factors. This contract will be organized as a base plus options contract. The estimated value of this contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.&nbsp;<br /><br /> The site visit is scheduled for 30 April 2015 at 10:00 AM EDT.&nbsp; Register via email for the site visit within&nbsp;48 hours of the start time to <a href="mailto:James.W.Purcell@usace.army.mil">James.W.Purcell@usace.army.mil</a> <br />by sending a completed Site Visit Form (see uploaded attachment to this notice).<br /><br />Site visit location is Cheatham Powerplant conference room at 2250 Cheatham Dam Road, Charlotte, TN 37036-5058.&nbsp; Vehicular access is from the West Bank of the Cumberland River in Dickson County.&nbsp; There is no vehicular access across the&nbsp;lock and&nbsp;dam from the East.<br />

<DESC>Pre Solicitation Notice for W912GB-15-R-0004   <br>    <br>  Project Title and Location: Integrated Training Area Management GIS Services Contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015   <br>    <br>  The United States (U.S.) Government is soliciting interest for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide training land management capability across the total Army.  The US Army recognizes that the execution of training to doctrinal standards under realistic combat conditions will affect the environment.  The ITAM Program is also an essential part of the Army's commitment to environmental stewardship.  ITAM establishes a systematic framework for decision-making and management of Army training lands.  This allows the Army to manage its land in an environmentally sound manner to ensure no net loss of training lands for accomplishing primary activities (training, testing, storage, etc,) or for impacting the overall training capability.  The effective integration of stewardship principles into training land and conservation management practices ensures that the Army's lands remain viable to support future training and mission requirements indefinitely.  It integrates elements of operational, environmental, master planning, and other programs to identify and assess land use alternatives.  The ITAM Program thus supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions.  The ITAM program consists of four major elements:  (i) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA, (ii) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), (iii) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), (iv) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA).    <br>  The Contractor shall support the aforementioned programs (depending upon the particular scope of the work contained in an individual Task Order) by conducting appropriate field surveys, field sampling, investigations, site visits, interviews, and literature searches; execute suitable studies; prepare satisfactory reports, prepare plans and specifications, perform on-going site monitoring, Geographic Information System support, imagery/drawings, cartographic mapping, and provide on-site support to assist in performing Sustainable Range Program (SRP) related tasks.  Any or all of the above may be required during the period of this contract.  Those work efforts described above may occur at any location described below.  <br>  There will be one (1) solicitation for the following geographical locations:  Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Slovenia.  Majority of the work is anticipated to be primarily in Germany.  <br>  Each project task order awarded under this contract shall normally be comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-packed tasks as described in each Task Order and the Unit Price Book.  <br>  The Award of this contract will be made on best value to the Government. Price and Technical factors will be considered.  <br>    <br>  a. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:   <br>  A base period of one (1) year and (3) three-year option periods.  <br>    <br>  b. MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE:   <br>  It is anticipated $2,375,000.00 annually for the base period and 3 option years, not-to-exceed $9,500,000 for the entire life of the contract.  <br>    <br>  c. MINIMUM GUARANTEE:   <br>  A single minimum guarantee amount of $5,000 covers the base period and any option period(s).   <br>    <br>  d. TASK ORDER LIMITATIONS:   <br>  The minimum task order is $2,500 and the maximum task order is $1,250,000 (reference clause 52.216-19).  On a case by case basis the Contracting Officer has the authority to issue task orders that may exceed the maximum task order limit.  <br>    <br>  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to encourage early Contractor involvement. Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions related to this notice or the draft SOW no later than Friday 09 January 2014 to Contract Specialist Ian McClary at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer Frank Johnson at Frank.j.Johnson@usace.army.mil.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
I
IAW FAR13.104. COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services
from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase.When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR 13.106-Hb), cos solicit from a single source for purchases
not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing	I
agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),C0s are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier. This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3). Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
652-15-3-116-1235	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT :
52131.30	
2.	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Kyphon surgical trays





3.	UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
Kyphon Balloon Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that can repair spinal fractures. It takes about an  hour per fractu re level to treat a fracture with balloon kyphoplasty, and the procedure can be done on an outpatient or inpatient basis.	
4. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE,WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:
A previous notice was issued to FBO in the past and only one SDVOSB company responded to the notice and wwas able to fulfill the requirement.
5.DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was conducted through GSA, NAC, and Google revealed that Medtronic USA only small business distributor  of Kyphon Trays is VHHS.A notice was posted on FBO and only one company responded that they were able to provide the products needed. In addition, Veterans Healthcare Supply Solutions could fulfill the requirement. They are a SDVOSB company.

<DESC>The purpose of this action is to just justify the award of firm-fixed price contract; PC-15-7-021 to Systegra Inc. located at 132 Stoneledge Place NE, Leesburg VA 20176 for security operations support services. The award was made on a sole source basis under U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology Schedule 70 Contract (IT 70 Schedule). The term of the contract (recognized as a bridge) will be for a 12 month period and will contain a 6 month base period and two 3 month option periods. The need for the bridge contract is entirely due to unanticipated delays encountered by the Government's acquisition team responsible for conducting the planned competitive procurement action for the follow-on contract. The two option periods (of three (3) months each) may be exercised should the agency encounter additional delays and/or if necessary to accommodate an adequate transition period to the follow-on contract.
