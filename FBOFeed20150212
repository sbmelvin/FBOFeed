Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $38.5M.
<p>AFRL requires 1 network license of Systems Tool Kit (STK) Pro, STK Communications Module, STK Coverage Module and Annual Support, used for planning, analysis, and design of complex aerospace systems; real-time space operations; and 3-D situational awareness and decision support.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Analytical Graphics Inc., (AGI) 220 Valley Creek Blvd., Exton PA 19341.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet the requirements in that the named products can be embedded within existing AFRL software development efforts supplying computation components and situational awareness displays to operational systems. AGI's embedded technology System Tool Kit (STK) engine allows users to leverage our core technologies into existing or custom developed applications that can easily be deployed. These products will be used for managing and distributing mission models and analytical services over the Web or enterprise network to support desktop and browser applications by exposing REST API to any desired STK object. Further, AGI Viewer allows STK users to share STK scenarios and analysis to non-STK users.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Richard.Childres@us.af.mil Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 6 March2015.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification document will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<DESC>It is anticipated that the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) will issue a solicitation for continued Support of Atmospheric Sciences (SAS) and the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). Currently, SAS and GMAO support is provided under two separate contracts (NNG12HP08C and NNG12HP06C respectively). NASA has reviewed these requirements and found technical symmetry, and therefore intends to combine these small business set-aside efforts and obtain the support by way of one contract. <p> SAS support includes but is not limited to (1) Instrumentation, (2) Data Processing and Analysis, (3) Earth System modeling and Analysis, (4) Documentation and Presentation, (5) Education and Public Outreach, and (6) Mission Science. Specific work elements within the above areas are described as follows: design, develop, test, maintain, calibrate, and operation of sub-orbital instruments for atmospheric and solar observations; processing and analysis of data collected by instruments observing the Earth atmosphere or solar radiation from spacecraft, sub-orbital platforms, or the ground; development, testing, operation, improvement, and documentation of computer models that describe Earth system processes; support project scientists in the formulation, implementation, and operation of satellite missions; support the preparation of research proposals, refereed journal publications, manuscripts for symposia and provide communications of research objectives and results both to the general public and NASA Management in a formal and informal way. <p> GMAO support, which is a key activity within the Earth-Sun Exploration Division, includes the development and use of models and assimilation systems with the goals of advancing satellite data in weather and climate prediction, and using satellite data to advance the U.S. environmental modeling capabilities. <p> NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources and seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,	and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the procurement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. All small disadvantaged business owned firms will need to be certified at the time of proposal submission if the procurement is set-aside. <p> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <p> Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. <p> Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business*, number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). <p> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  <p> All responses shall be submitted to Russellyn R. Hart no later than 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 13, 2015. Responses may be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:russellyn.hart-1@nasa.gov">russellyn.hart-1@nasa.gov </a>  or mailed to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Attn: Russellyn R.

<DESC>This publication announces the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) plans to release the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 version of the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA), NNH15ZEA001N. Detailed requirements, including Proposal Due Dates will be stated in Appendices that address individual Thrust Areas. The initial release of this ROA 2015 NRA includes ones solicitation (ACP1) in Appendix A.5 for the Advanced Composites Project.  Additional appendices will be posted as Amendments to the ROA NRA and will be published as requirements materialize throughout the year. The FY 2015 ROA NRA (NNH15ZEA001N) can be accessed from the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) website, (<A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>    ), by going first to "Solicitations", and then to "Open Solicitations". Once Amendments are available interested parties can access Open Solicitations, click on NRA NNH15ZEA001N, and then click on Amendments. <p> Under the FY 2015 ROA NRA ARMD will continue solicitation of foundational and systems-level research proposals for four programs within ARMD: the Advanced Air Vehicles Program, the Airspace Operations and Safety Program, the Integrated Aviation Systems Program, and the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program. The Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) conducts cutting-edge research that will generate innovative concepts, technologies, capabilities, and knowledge to enable revolutionary advances for a wide range of air vehicles. The Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) develops and explores fundamental concepts, algorithms, and technologies to increase throughput and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) safely. The Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) will conduct research at an integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and explore/assess/demonstrate the benefits in relevant environments. The Transformative Aeronautics Concepts (TAC) Program cultivates multi-disciplinary, revolutionary concepts to enable aviation transformation and harnesses convergence in aeronautics and non-aeronautics technologies to create new opportunities in aviation. The goal of TAC is to knock down technical barriers and infuse concepts into all six ARMD strategic thrusts. The structure of the ROA NRA will require that proposals be submitted to the most relevant aeronautics program elements, which will be described in Appendices to the NRA. Specific Proposal submission deadline dates, any particular evaluation criteria, and submission points of contact will also be identified in the NRA Appendices. <p> With the exception of government organizations and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry and nonprofit organizations. Proposals must be submitted electronically, and all proposers may use NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES ( <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com">http://nspires.nasaprs.com </A>	 ), or Grants.gov. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. <p> Electronic proposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. <p> As topic areas are released further information about specific program elements will be available. The individual Program Officers and assigned Contracting Officers will be listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element. Questions concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Susan Minor, Integration and Management Office Deputy Director, NASA Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, email: <a href="mailto:NASA-roa@nasa.gov">NASA-roa@nasa.gov </a> . <p> This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 and NFS 1835.016. <p> Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), Biophysics section plans to procure on a sole source bases with FEI Company, 5350 N.E. Dawson Creek Dr., Hillsboro, OR 97124 for maintenance of the government-owned FEI Electron Microscope TF30 Polara Serial number D256.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard in $19.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for the government-owned Electron Microscope TF30 Polara, S/N D256.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) One (1) preventive maintenance inspections per component during the contract period; 2) emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract, a technician shall arrive within 24 hours.; 3) software service in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures, to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and troubleshooting of the operating systems; and 4) all required replacement parts, with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries. Parts shall be new or remanufactured to original equipment specifications. Personnel shall be factory trained and experience in servicing the type of equipment covered by this contract. All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support that shall have at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.</p>
<p>This maintenance agreement is required to maintain laboratory accreditation. To maintain the highest standard performance, complex scientific instruments are required to be maintained and serviced by the original manufacturer. The nature of NCI's research requires utilization of this instrumentation around the clock and often over weekends. Thus, the NCI cannot afford lengthy periods of down-time. FEI has manufacturer-trained service engineers on site Monday through Friday and some parts are also kept on site. The proximity of manufacturer-trained service engineers and OEM parts that are designed for the instrument, require this contractor to be the sole award recipient for this service contract. FEI stocks spare parts for the microscope which reduces the down time of NCI's clinical service. To sustain the high level of precision required for operation, periodic maintenance (beyond end-user ability) is required. Without such maintenance, generation of high quality, reproducible data is compromised. FEI is the sole vendor possessing the capability to inspect, repair, upgrade, and maintain the Electron Microscope, therefore is uniquely qualified to service NCI's electron microscope. NCI knows of no other source capable of providing these services.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA(SSSA)-2015-PSOL22 and the solicitation is issued as a pre-solicitation notice of intent to award a non-competitive order to Acumen, LLC, 500 Airport Blvd, Suite 365, Burlingame, CA 94010.
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05-73, dated April 29, 2014.<br />The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Drug intends to procure on a sole source basis an inclusive service agreement for linking CMS data to NIA Supported Surveys for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the tasks and deliverables described in this Statement of Work (SOW). NIA wishes to contract with an entity who is a CMS approved contractor and who has specified data sets (see section B) from 1991 to 2012, to link to NIA funded surveys. These data sets should be linked using existing algorithms developed through SBIR/STTR grants. The contractor should update NIA funded surveys with the latest data from CMS as it becomes available on an annual basis and create user friendly summary research files which are consistent with previous years' summary files and distribute these files to researchers.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>A. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (SCOPE OF WORK)<br />1. The tasks comprising this contract include already having full access to CMS data from 1991-2012, gaining full access of new CMS data as they become available, updating linkages of these new data to two surveys (HRS and PSID) and ensuring that previously linked data remains accessible and updatable; distribution of linked research files to approved users, and further enhancement of breadth and depth of the data products available for researchers. Specific tasks include the following:</p>
<p><br />Task 1: Data Linkage and Acquisition<br />Contractor will maintain the existing CMS data inventory (which includes CMS data linked to HRS and PSID) and update this inventory as new CMS data become available and obtain approval from CMS for linkages as necessary. <br />Note: NIA does not own the data. The contractor should have an active DUA with CMS with data specified in Section B which they can re-use to link NIA supported surveys.</p>
<p>Task 2: Processing Research Files for survey linkages <br />Contractor will continue development of research extracts and summaries of CMS administrative files at the person level tailored to satisfy the research needs of a wide range of users. The aim is to create summary formats that remove the burden of working with large and complicated claims files in multiple formats across multiple years. In constructing these research files, algorithms will be created to translate raw claims records into meaningful indicators of medical conditions and treatments. These files will be formulated to provide user friendly and easy access to statistics describing individual respondents' health status and usage of medical services. This formulation shall be developed and refined with the input of the 2 survey developers (HRS and PSID) and their research teams on an annual basis. Development shall also include creation of versions of research files designed to enhance information content while maintaining data confidentially through the masking of HIPPA-sensitive variable. This tasks assumes no change in data structure/elements.</p>
<p>Task 3: Documentation<br />Contractor shall maintain and further enhance data documentation for both the linked research extracts of the raw claims records and the research summary constructions of the CMS data on an annual basis. This data documentation shall be directly built into the research extract files, making specific data elements both easily understood and retrievable by potential users. In addition to written material, documentation shall also be provided in accessible and easily searchable electronic formats (e.g., HTML, Excel and Access formats). In addition to data layouts that report a label and description for each data element, contractor shall, in collaboration with study directors, develop more detailed data documentation and tools for working with CMS data, including value formats and value frequencies, advisories on specific data elements and general guidance on the usefulness of CMS data for health services and health economics research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Task 4: Distribution of Research Files<br />Contractor will distribute linked research extracts to end users in compliance with existing CMS and survey data security policies. The process of extracting the data may be specific to each data request. Minimally, each data distribution shall include the following elements:<br />&bull; Confirmation of request specifications;<br />&bull; Validation of approval for distribution of CMS linked data from survey managers (e.g. HRS or PSID); <br />&bull; Validation of approval of CMS DUA procedures;<br />&bull; Verification of data extracts as specified in the CMS DUA;<br />&bull; Encryption of data files when written to media; and <br />&bull; Secure shipment/transfer of data files to the end user.</p>
<p>Task 5: User Support<br />Contractor shall provide technical assistance and other guidance to users during all phases of the data request process. Guidance includes assisting users with formulating their requests, directing users to resources regarding requests and DUAs, and facilitating DUA acquisition and maintenance. Contractor staff shall also provide technical support in decryption and reading data and support for understanding documentation to users after receipt of shipped data files. Contractor may develop and maintain other tools for user support, which could include websites and discussion boards, to supplement documentation.</p>
<p><br />Take 6: Project Management (see also Section C.2) <br />Contractor shall track and maintain detailed records of all request specifications and shipments and deliveries. These records will be available on a real time basis, and contractor will be able to respond to a request for information from NIA within 2 business days. Minimally, contractor shall provide reports monthly to NIA detailing the researchers (including institutional affiliation) who requested lined datasets, dates of requests, research files distributed, and timeframes of permitted use along with DUA number and NIA grant number (when applicable).<br />This report shall also identify any problems that arose and a statement explaining how the problem was resolved. This report shall also identify any problems that have arisen but have not been completely resolved and provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Contractor shall manage and coordinate regular communication with personnel from all affiliated surveys and registries. This communication will inform these personnel about the status of administrative data linkages, availability of data products, and details summarizing the distribution of files to users.<br />Finally, contractor will maintain whatever records and communication are required by CMS as part of its DUA procedures.</p>
<p><br />Task 7: Development of Research Files When CMS Changes Data Structures (Optional task)<br />CMS may from time to time modify their data structures which will require timely updates in order to maintain consistency with current summary files. Contractor will continue such development under optional task and update algorithms of research extracts and summaries of CMS administrative files so that the data files distributed by the contractor remains consistent across multiple years as CMS changes data formats. It is contractors' responsibility to inform NIA when such data structure changes occurs. Offeror in their proposal should provide cost estimate for optional Task 7.</p>
<p>Task 8: Linkage of existing CMS administrative data to new surveys and registries (as identified by NIA) (Optional task) <br />NIA anticipates that new surveys may require linkages during the term of the contract. In this case NIA will exercise the options. Offeror should provide cost estimates per survey for up to 10 surveys.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to Rapp OptoElectronic GMBH for an uncaging/optogenetic system without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).<br /><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.<br /><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-78 dated December 26, 2014.<br /><br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br /><br /><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1.
<p><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this procurement is acquisition of one Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH uncaging/optogenetic system for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) Synaptic Plasticity Section (SPS). This equipment will be used to upgrade a Rapp Optoelectronics Model No. Olympus BX51WI Microscope owned by the NIDA IRP and used for electrophysiological research studies. Only Rapp Optoelectronics equipment upgrades are acceptable to ensure continued full function of owned equipment which is proprietary to its original equipment manufacturer. <br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>Specifically, the NIDA IRP SPS requires a Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH Galvanometer Scanner-Based Uncaging and Optogenetics System as follows:</p>
<p>1. One (1) UGA-42-Geo combo point and selectable spot shape combination system<br />2. One (1) DL-375nm/200mW turn-key, software-controlled laser system<br />3. One (1) Speckle Reducer.<br />4. FOB Destination Delivery<br />5. Installation and Training</p>
<p>To ensure continuity of science and continued full function of owned proprietary equipment, only a Rapp Optoelectronics Galvanometer Scanner-Based Uncaging and Optogenetics System is acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery/Period of Performance<br /></strong>It is expected that the above described project requirements will be delivered within four (4) months after contractor receipt of award. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.<br /><br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, only Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH&nbsp;is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement because the microscope requiring additional capabilities to advance research studies is proprietary to this company, the original equipment manufacturer. Due to the proprietary nature of the Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH&nbsp;Microscope Model No. Olympus BX51WI, use of any other contractor's systems for upgrade purposes is impossible as it would result in upgrade failure and may jeopardize the integrity of the owned equipment. Such an attempt would also negate equipment warranties remaining for the Model No. Olympus BX51WI Microscope. Non-functional upgrades and possible damage to the owned equipment would be critically detrimental to the NIDA IRP studies. As such, only Rapp Optoelectronics can provide the required software and hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>Further, only a galvanometer system from Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH&nbsp;is acceptable to upgrade the owned microscope to ensure continuity of scientific research. The NIDA IRP conducts a number of state of the art studies that utilize significant quantities of data from the Model No. Olympus BX51WI Microscope and these studies now require additional technology for continuation. The data already acquired using the owned microscope is highly sensitive to the proprietary parts and software of the OEM-proprietary equipment. Accordingly, no technology other than a Rapp Optoelectronics galvanometer system being added to the existing system will allow the already-acquired research data to continue to be viable and relevant to new data.</p>
<p>For these many reasons, Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH&nbsp;is the only contractor capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

<p>The initial contract period will be for one (1) year and the Government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five (5) years by exercising each of the four (4) one-year renewal options. Work under the contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual Task Orders. The price of any single task order shall be at least $500 but shall not exceed $150,000. The maximum order amount for the entire potential contract period (base year plus all option years) shall be $1,000,000. There is no guaranteed minimum for the base period or option periods if exercised. Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements for individual or clusters of projects.<br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of North Dakota. The Surveyor will provide a Boundary Survey of the EWP/WRP/FRPP/WRE Easement Area which meets the accuracy specifications and positional tolerances for Rural Surveys as set forth by the State of North Dakota Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. Projects will be located throughout the State of North Dakota. Task orders will be specific in terms of location, acreage and time deadline. Work under each Task Order will be subject to satisfactory price negotiation prior to issuance of a Notice to Proceed (NTP). Task orders will be awarded as sites requiring surveys are identified which may be as early as the date of contract award. Total number of task orders awarded will be based on need and availability of funds. Each task order shall be completed within 45 days of award to the contractor.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA: Firms which meet the requirements described are invited to submit one original and three (3) copies of Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Part 1, Contract Specific Qualifications. Interested firms must include a cover letter on their company letterhead that includes the solicitation number and indicates which regional contract(s) they seek consideration for. Firms that fail to include such a cover letter with the information requested may be disqualified from consideration. Complete submittals must be limited to a maximum of 25 pages. <br />All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in descending order of importance. (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services. (2) Specialized experience such as: rural or conservation easement boundary surveys; local courthouse legal description/plat map requirements; electronic data collection, computer generated plan development, and technical competence in the type of work required. (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. (4) Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. (5) Location of the contractor to the general geographic area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project. (6) Demonstrated experience with similar types of projects in the State of North Dakota within the last five (5) years. In addition to the cover letter and SF 330, firms must provide a customer reference list with contact information (addresses and telephone numbers) for all projects listed as related experience.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration visit the SAM Web Site at www.sam.gov. <br />This is NOT a Request for Proposals but a Request for Qualifications. Do not submit pricing information with qualification Documents.<br />For the purpose of simplifying and increasing efficiency in the negotiation and to assist in the execution of Task Orders against the IDIQ, apparent successful offerors shall submit an acceptable forward pricing rate agreement (FRPA) Proposal to the Contracting Officer to be eligible for award. The apparent successful offerors shall provide a FPRA proposal within the requested time period to be identified by the Government (do not submit until requested). The FPRA proposal shall include, but is not limited to, a description of direct labor categories, direct labor rates, annual escalation of all rates, G&amp;A rates, Overhead rates, Computer Assisted Design rates, and other recurring costs. Where practicable the contractor may provide Fixed Price Rates for Unit Pricing Elements. The FPRA proposal will be negotiated and a formal Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA) will be incorporated into the resultant IDIQ contract. Apparent successful offerors, who fail to negotiate an acceptable FPRA with the Contracting Officer, will be ineligible for award. The contractor agrees to submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as required by FAR 15.406-2(a), for all Task Orders and modifications exceeding $700,000.<br />The CO will commence negotiations with the top-ranked firm for the first contract (North/ Northeastern North Dakota Contract). The FPRA Proposal will be evaluated and negotiated for fair and reasonable price. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may request a proposal from the next highest ranked offeror, and the process will continue until a contract has been awarded. The CO will then begin negotiations for the second contract, the South/ Southeastern North Dakota Contract, beginning with the top-ranked firm for that contract and proceeding in the same manner as described above. Once the second contract is successfully negotiated, the CO will commence negotiations for the third, the Western North Dakota Contract, proceeding in the same manner described for the first two. <br />Because capacity is an evaluation criteria, a firm's award of one regional contract may impact its ranking for the other two regional contracts.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Those firms that wish to be considered must submit an original and three copies of the complete package. The package must be received at the following address: ATTN: John D Armstrong Procurement Technician 220 East Rosser Ave Room 278 Bismarck ND, 58501. Submittals are due by 3:00 pm central time on March 25, 2015. Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent Booz Allen Hamilton at 46950 Bradley Blvd Lexington Park, MD 20653 for 412,800 (four hundred twelve thousand eight hundred) hours of support services. This is necessary for the continuance of <span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin">contractor support services to the SCR Division in the areas of C4SIR operational systems development including systems assessments and design, systems acquisition and program planning, integrated project management and strategy and analytics services for diverse hardware related projects in different development stages. </span>The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing ongoing support currently being done under existing BAH task order, N00178-04-D-4024-M802, while the follow-on contract is being completed with an estimated award date in October 2016. This requirement will be a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) bridge contract<span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt">. </span>Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under task order N00178-04-D-4024-M802 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work, BAH is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will consider all information received by 27 February 2015 1530 EST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will not pay for any information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No telephone responses will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions shall be submitted to Tiffany Crayle, Code 2.5.1.3.19, Telephone (301) 737-7568, or via email: tiffany.crayle@navy.mil.
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAH is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>EPA-RTPPOD has a requirement for continuation of services under the current EPA-RTP Facilities Maintenance and Support Services Contract (O&M) EP-D-09-095 until such time that the competition for the follow-on O&M contract is completed and the follow-on contract begins. The EPA has multiple facilities in the RTP and Chapel Hill, NC area (combined to make up EPA-RTP Facilities).  All O&M responsibilities for the EPA-RTP Facilities are performed under contract EP-D-09-095.  The EPA's facilities on the main campus in RTP are 1.2 million square feet of offices, laboratories, computer and conference spaces, and child care facilities.  The EPA RTP facilities are classified as a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Bio-Safety Level II Research Facility and AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International) facilities.  
Amec Foster Wheeler Environment & Infrastructure, Inc (AMEC) has provided support to EPA under contract EP-D-09-095 since September 2009.  RTPPOD is currently in the process of issuing a solicitation with intent to award a new contract under competitive procedures by September 2015.  Depending on the outcome of that competitive procurement, responsibility for the EPA-RTP requirement may transition to a new contractor.  Contractor transition for a requirement with the size, scope and complexity of this SOW is complex and places critical Government facilities, assets and systems at increased risk as the incoming contractor becomes fully capable to perform the support functions required.  Continuity of services and personnel is essential to the health of the facility and the facility's role in supporting EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment.  The Government will potentially enter a transitional period between contractors for this requirement in September  2015.  The potential period of performance for the new contract (Base Period plus four potential Option Periods) will make the risk and costs inherent in transitional activities acceptable to the Government.  A modification of EP-D-09-095 to allow for continuation of services with the current O&M Contractor (AMEC) provides the lowest risk for critical facility and systems support for the six month time period contemplated.  Additional details are below.
AMEC currently employs a staff of maintenance technicians, supervision, and administrative personnel to support EPA's operation and maintenance support requirements at RTP.  Contractors generally propose incumbent retention target rates to fulfill personnel requirements as part of their technical proposal.  There is no assurance that incumbent staffing retention targets could be achieved during the actual transition phase of the contract.  This means increased costs for training, clearance of employees (EPASS, OASIS, etc.), uniforms and the overall costs of employees becoming familiar with the facilities.  These risks and/or associated costs are anticipated, expected and acceptable when awarding a long term contract as the Government will receive value and benefit from the investment in the successful offeror and their personnel.  Transitional risk and/or costs for a contractor to perform services over a six month period of performance with the likely potential that another t ransition would occur in September 2015 would be inappropriate and irresponsible as the Government would accept high levels of performance risk without receiving benefit from sustained continuity of those personnel.
A short term disruption to the continuity of operations for the maintenance and operations of this facility (prior to the new contract award date of September 2015) would also lead to increased costs due to excess turnover and unacceptable levels of risk exposure to Government assets and facilities in the following:
- Operations and Maintenance of the BAS (Building Automation Systems) 
- Disruptions to Environmental Conditions impacting: -----Laboratory Research conducted at the EPA RTP Facilities, which are designated as Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Bio-Safety II Research Facilities.  RTP-EPA has over 400 research laboratories associated under its current SOW. -----The EPA's National Computer Center (NCC) located on EPA RTP Campus. -----Childcare at First Environments Early Learning Center located on EPA RTP Campus. -----Endangerment of Laboratory Animals housed on EPA RTP Campus, which is an AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) certified facility.
- Potential disruption to the Preventative Maintenance Program, which effects: -----More than 11,000 individual items or pieces of equipment that require routine and/or scheduled maintenance tasks. -----Over 800 separate types of routine and/or scheduled maintenance tasks performed on those items and/or equipment.
The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can support this O&M requirement.  The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension that no other contractors could transition this workload from AMEC, and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, and unnecessary risks to the Government.  This six month extension of services is also not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor.  Interested contractors will have the opportunity to compete for this long term work under the re-competed contract.  
In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(C)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.
This six month extension to contract EP-D-09-095 will be issued via contract modification, therefore no formal solicitation is anticipated for this requirement.  EPA-RTPPOD will issue the request for proposal via formal request letter.

<p>&bull; Policy Development and Analysis<br />&bull; Demonstration and Evaluation Design<br />&bull; Program Assessment and Evaluation<br />&bull; Data Infrastructure Development and Modeling</p>
<p>The work in each of these domains is neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, and work may logically fit into two or more domains.</p>
<p>In conjunction with these services, the Contractor shall provide organizational and logistical support for conferences, meetings, and other events to assist in the development and dissemination of the deliverables produced under this technical area. Logistical support may entail making travel arrangements, securing hotel accommodations and meeting space, editing and report formatting, and providing technical expertise in support of conferences (e.g., agenda setting, recruitment of expert presenters, and preparation of conference papers and materials). An individual delivery order may require expertise in only one area of expertise or a combination of areas.</p>
<p>Technical Area 2: Health Information Technology, Electronic Health Records, and Health Information Exchange</p>

ASPE, AHRQ, and ONC are responsible for planning, developing, coordinating, managing, implementing, and/or evaluating, many of the HHS policies and programs, including policies and programs to accelerate the use, interoperable exchange and re-use of health information to support the independence, productivity, health and security of the American people including vulnerable populations such as persons with various physical and mental health conditions, including children, working age adults, and older persons. Electronic health information exchange, including interoperable health information exchange, is increasing in response to provisions in HITECH and the Affordable Care Act. Activities are being undertaken to extend, evaluate, and further support widespread implementation of interoperable health information use and exchange across the care continuum, including through the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other health IT applications, to enable improvements in care coordination, quality of care, and efficiencies in service delivery, payment, and eligibility determination. These activities are being undertaken and encouraged at the federal, state, local, provider, and/or consumer levels.</p>
<p>Generally, ASPE, AHRQ, and ONC will engage in a range of policy, program, and health services research, planning, implementation, evaluation, and information dissemination activities to support and accelerate the widespread adoption and use of health IT, EHRs, and health information exchange (including interoperable HIE) to improve health care quality. These activities span a range of HHS, other federal, state, and private sector programs; providers across the care continuum, and public and private sector payers. These activities may focus on the delivery of care in traditional fee-for-service and/or service delivery and/or payment environments undergoing transformation. The work undertaken by ASPE, AHRQ, and ONC in this technical area is described below in the following broad areas. However, these substantive areas are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, and work may logically fit into two or more categories.</p>

<p>&bull; Policy Research, Health Services Research, and Planning, Development, and Analysis<br />&bull; Pilot Program Demonstration, Implementation, and Evaluation<br />&bull; Program Implementation, Management, and Evaluation<br />&bull; Information Dissemination Activities</p>
<p>The work in each of these domains is neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, and work may logically fit into two or more domains.</p>
<p>In conjunction with these services, the Contractor shall provide organizational and logistical support for conferences, meetings, and other events to assist in the development and dissemination of the deliverables produced under this technical area. Logistical support may entail making travel arrangements, securing hotel accommodations and meeting space, editing and report formatting, and providing technical expertise in support of conferences (e.g., agenda setting, recruitment of expert presenters, and preparation of conference papers and materials).

This will facilitate the analysis of options for refining the design of ExLab 4.   <br>  <br> Military action conducted by units in globally austere environments, such as Afghanistan, and overseas contingency operation (OCO) areas or regions often require solutions for capability gaps experienced on the battlefield and austere remote outposts as quickly as possible.  The REF accomplishes this mission by deploying ExLab teams comprised of Government, military, and civilians to work with Soldiers wherever they may be engaged.   <br>  <br> The purpose of ExLab 4 is to provide U.S. Army units in austere regions a modular, scalable, tailorable, sling loadable via UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter, self sustaining rapid fabrication and prototyping laboratory.  This ExLab will enhance mission effectiveness of Army units operating in expeditionary environments by empowering Soldier-led innovative solutions and addressing capability gaps that can be prototyped and fabricated at the point of execution.  This modular, integrated system is comprised of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) components. <br>  <br> Current ExLabs provide worldwide communications, rapid prototyping (3D printing), metal machining, tools for rapid fabrication, electronic repair, data processing and numerical simulation workstations, design software, and instrumentation for electronic measurement.  The configuration of these Labs is a 20 foot connex box and Military Internal Airlift/Helicopter Slingable-Container Unit (ISU) -90 to house all equipment and workstations.  While this configuration holds a great deal of equipment and is transportable, it does not allow for items to be sling loadable via UH-60L and is not tailorable to certain missions.  The REF will host an Industry Day on 03 March 2015 at Fort Belvoir, VA from 0900 to 1600 to provide all interested parties the opportunity to view the Governments existing ExLab 3 and ask questions related to the desired build of ExLab 4.  To register please go to www.ref.army.mil and indicate if you will be attending Industry Day and if you would like to brief the group or the REF in your response to this RFI.  Please note that attendees must be US citizens and due to space limitations, participation is limited to two people from each organization/company.  Detailed directions, security procedures, etc... will be provided a week prior to the event via email, to those who have registered on the required website.   <br>  <br> The REF is seeking to improve upon the initial Lab capability by building a fourth lab which encompasses the necessary equipment in a modular system design that is tailorable, scalable, and sling loadable by UH-60L's, giving the REF the ability to be moved into areas of operation via a packaged approach. The solution being requested is split into three packages that meet the capabilities, tasks, and attributes listed in Attachment A.  The three packages are: Operational Integration Package, Limited Rapid Fabrication Capability Package, and an Enhanced Fabrication Capability Package, see Attachment B.  <br>  <br> The Operational Integration Package consists of items with the ability to establish a minimal footprint, be self sustaining, provide the basic ability to diagnose problems, conduct minimal reverse engineering, and provide solutions through continental United States reach back support via a robust communications system. The Limited Rapid Fabrication Capability Package shall function as a minimal tool and machine shop for on the spot repairs, adding to or modifying Soldier kit, and electronic parts, whereas the Enhanced Fabrication Capability Package provides true prototyping and larger scale fabrication and repairs via Fused Deposition Modeling and a Computer Numerical Control milling machine. All three packages shall have general container requirement specifications, i.e. ability to connect power between containers (see Attachment A, Tab ExLab4 General Container Req.), be self sustaining, and be capable of entering a region independently or in various package configurations.   <br>  <br> Requested Information: <br> The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  Although solicitation terminology may appear in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  <br>  <br> This notice is part of Government market research.

<DESC>Synopsis: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUESTING SPECIFIC AND INNOVATIVE RISK MITIGATION SOLUTIONS FOR AN INTERIM CONTRACT REQUIREMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES, NOR IS IT THE INTENT OF THE MISSION AND INSTALLATION CONTRACTING COMMAND CENTER FORT BRAGG, TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOUGHT.   <br>  <br> Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center Fort Bragg (MCFB), Fort Bragg, NC is seeking preliminary marketing information, from capable and reliable sources who can provide specific innovative solutions that mitigate the inherit risk associated with a procuring services within a very condensed timeframe.  An interim contract is necessary to minimize lapse in services for the time period of March 2015 through March 2016 for awarding task orders in support of the United States Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO).   <br>  <br> Respondents must address risk associated with accelerated short notice requirements, multiple worldwide locations, security clearance and country clearance processing, curriculum and training materials produced in various language and dialects that would typically drive cost risk not offset by competition.   Delays necessitate an interim coverage for a short period of time between lapse of contract and final award and transition to the new contract. Applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611699 with a current business size of $11M.  <br>  <br> No proposals are requested by this announcement; all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. Further, the Government is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data. Contractors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Sources Sought.  <br>  <br> All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FBO.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  To provide Security Assistance Training in support of U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (USASATMO). USASATMO is a subordinate command under the U. S. Army Security Assistance Command (USASAC), and a Major Subordinate Command (MSC) of Army Materiel Command (AMC).  USASATMO executes the overseas portion of the U.S. Army's Security Assistance Enterprise Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) training and technical assistance mission.  USASATMO plans, forms, prepares, deploys, sustains and re-deploys Continental United States (CONUS) based Security Assistance Teams (SATs) to execute OCONUS Security Cooperation missions in support of Geographic Combatant Command Theater Security Cooperation Programs and U.S. foreign policy (For the purposes herein, the terms  quote mark Security Assistance quote mark  and  quote mark Security Cooperation quote mark  mean  quote mark Foreign Military Aid. quote mark ) <br>   <br> USASATMO staffs teams with active component Army, active component members of other services, reserve component Army, reserve component members of other services and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians. USASATMO will request procurement of contractor services if none of these are available for any given Education and Training or Aviation Training mission.  Specific skill requirements will be identified at the Task Order (TO) level. When it is known that uniformed personnel will not be available, contractor support will become the first option considered.  In other cases, the more rapid reaction time of contractors may be a governing factor in using contractor teams. Education and Training and/or Aviation SATs may be a single Contractor employee, a combination of DoD personnel and Contractor employee(s), or entirely Contractor employees. USASATMO requires a variety of expertise while preparing to deploy a SAT, during the training execution phase and during the post deployment stage of a mission cycle <br>  <br> BROAD DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Aviation. USASATMO performs a wide variety of specialized aviation missions with multiple standard and non-standard aircraft types and skill sets. FMS customers desire aviation training from a military focused curriculum.  For example, providing senior instructor pilot level certifications, military grade aircraft maintenance and inspections as well as establishing progressive aviation policies and standard operating procedures. The military concentration for training generally limits the pool of potential contractor employees to high-demand military retirees. SATMO-supported aircraft are often either newly fielded or no longer in the U.S. inventory which further reduces the pool of available experts.   <br> Education and Training Requirements. The education concept is designed around small teams, capable of deploying and serving as robust training teams capable of providing specialty services and assisting in building host nation capacity across a broad spectrum of combat arms, combat support, leadership and institutional building subjects. Education services assist partner nations in meeting their near term objectives or assist in developing desired capabilities. Programs of instructions (POI) are customized for particular training requirements including battle staff training, maintenance and supply procedures and concepts, warrior leader development and quality assurance supervision and training. USASATMO missions often require unique skills, qualifications and certifications with particular documentation requirements. Managing OCONUS personnel turnover is made more challenging by these training/qualification requirements. <br>  <br> Interested parties shall submit their innovative solutions for the interim timeframe electronically to SFC Casey Gordon at casey.e.gordon.mil@mail.mil and Ms. Casie Savage at casie.m.savage.civ@mail.mil. All responses shall have the following information contained in the Subject Line of the electronic mail,  quote mark Response to Sources Sought 15-012, USASATMO quote mark . Responses should be sent no later than 0800 (8:00am) Eastern Standard Time on 23 February 2015.  No hard-copy or facsimile submissions will be accepted. Cover letters and extraneous materials (brochures, etc) will not be considered. Responders shall address the specific innovative risk mitigation for this requirement through this RFI in written format via email. Fax transmittals will not be accepted. Personal visits for discussing this notice will not be scheduled.  <br>  <br> If the recipients believe that the Army is unreasonably restricting competition, please contact the Advocate for Competition, Dean Carsello at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil. Concerns must address the title of this requirement, reference this synopsis, and specifically why the respondent believes the Army is unreasonably restricting competition. Any submission that identifies potential risk mitigation will be considered; however, the Government will determine its validity and implementation. <br>  <br>  <br>

<CONTACT>Charles Reimer, Acquisition Specialist, Phone 215.737.3829, Email Charles.Reimer@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support is seeking sources capable of providing Boston Scientific's cardiovascular product line that fall into the following product categories; Interventional Cardiology, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electophysiology and Peripheral Intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Along with the products in these categories the vendor must be capable of supplying the ancillary accessories (such as needles for entry and guide wire) that are necessary for the physician to perform cardiovascular surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<p><br />Through Market Research it has been determined that these cardiovascular items (i.e. stents, balloons, catheters etc) are frequently ordered based upon "physician preference/experience", whereby other factors that would normally affect the decision to purchase the items on a competitive basis (i.e. price) are usually not considered when ordering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A physician's decision to use a particular manufacturer's cardiovascular products is primarily based on the technical characteristics of the product that is expected to produce a higher quality of life for their patient's or achieve therapeutic results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once trained and comfortable with a particulars manufacturer's cardiovascular products, the physician will likely use that manufacturer's products for the duration of their career.</p>
<p>The ancillary accessories such as needles for entry and guide wire could technically be interchangeable between manufacturers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cardiovascular manufacturers provide these ancillary accessories because they are used with the other products mentioned above and are necessary for the physician to perform cardiovascular surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority of physicians use the same manufacturers cardiovascular accessories (both the ones mentioned above and the ancillary accessories) for the entire surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>All applicable cardiovascular products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>There are (3) three delivery method (Just-In-Time (JIT), Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) and Consignment Agreement) used to support Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for cardiovascular products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the JIT method, the MTF calls the manufacturer sales representative when a surgery is scheduled to discuss the case, make a products selection and inform him or her of the surgery date and time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The manufacturer sales representative will either "carry-in" or "ship" the cardiovascular products necessary for implantation to the designated site at the scheduled time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the type of surgery, the representative may have in the MTF's possession a number of "back-up" components available to the physician's during the entire procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the DVD method, MTF's may order products in advance of a scheduled surgery or purchase replacement inventory on an as needed basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under this method all items are packaged for shipment to the delivery point cited on the purchase order. Under the Consignment delivery method the cardiovascular products are placed in the MTF's, who only pay for the products that are actually used during the surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Depending on the complexity of the surgical procedure, a qualified sales representative will be on site at the MTF, if requested by the surgeon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The representative provides technical and product information to physicians before, during and after implantation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, product related support is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week despite the delivery method utilized to deliver the product.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) strategy is guided by Six Strategic Thrusts identified in response to three overarching global mega-drivers that will, in large part, shape the needs of aeronautical research in the coming years (see Attachment A).	This Request for Information (RFI) focuses on Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles and, more specifically, on system/subsystem/technology solutions for environmentally friendly subsonic fixed wing commercial transports that carry people and/or cargo. Future RFIs may address other ARMD Strategic Thrusts.  NASAs technology development goals for subsonic commercial transports target aircraft noise, emissions, and energy consumption as set forth in Attachment B.  More information on NASA Aeronautics is available at <A HREF="http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/">http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/ </A>   Starting in FY16, ARMDs Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) and Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) and associated centers will be performing Flight Demonstrations (FD) and complex Ground Demonstrations (GD) that mature select technologies to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5/6.  In addition, FDs may include flight research of early integrated, transformative ideas.  The FDs and GDs will provide research results enabling definitive progress towards the research themes associated with Strategic Thrust 3 - Ultra Efficient Commercial Vehicles as shown in Attachment A.  To accomplish TRL of 5/6, it is recognized that some technologies require FD (e.g. integrated aero/structure/control concepts like an advanced wing trailing-edge system), while others require complex GD to achieve this same TRL (e.g. advanced combustor integrated in a propulsion system, or a large scale structural ground test with a novel material/manufacturing approach). Both FD and GD are within the scope of this RFI. NASA is interested in a diverse portfolio of demonstrations that will vary in terms of execution time and total investment.  The FDs and GDs should be planned to complete execution within one to three years (not including planning/formulation) and require total investments estimated to be in the range of $10 million to $60 million (per demonstration)	that includes NASA and partner contributions (see 4a below). ARMDs Programs are crafting an acquisition strategy, with a solicitation round planned for release in the FY16 time period. The program is considering all acquisition strategies available, including: competitions using a NASA Research Announcement (NRA); FAR Part 15 based competitions; competitions using existing Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contracts; and other transactions (such as non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements).	Potential procurement mechanisms include cooperative agreements, FAR based contracts and task orders, and non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements. Part of this acquisition strategy includes methods of performing collaborative research, including substantive cost sharing with industry partners, via cooperative agreements, cost share contracts, and other agreements.  The purpose of the RFI is to solicit (1) recommendations of technologies associated with the Thrust 3 Research Themes ready for Integrated FD or GD, a statement of the specific technical barrier or hurdle to be overcome, and associated test campaigns that can be completed in a three year window; (2) product-focused transition plans associated with the identified technologies; (3) comments on acquisition strategy, including existing contract and other vehicles that could be utilized for the FD or GD demonstration, and cost sharing; (4) recommendations of types of business vehicle(s) (such as cooperative agreement, cost share contract, etc.) that would best address program goals and your area of interest considering: (4a) partner cost sharing expectations that may exceed 50%, depending on the technology/demonstration; (4b) Intellectual property rights challenges; (5) a list of potential of NASA facilities and potential flight assets (NASA and others) that may be used; and 6) realistic, yet innovative, approaches to the execution of the proposed demonstrations with the goal of containing total demonstration cost and schedule. Interested parties should submit a written response in Microsoft Word or pdf via electronic submission. The response should include: for each FD/GD, a summary quad chart (see Attachment C) and a one page executive summary; and, a response to the above requested information of 5 pages or less. Interested parties are also requested to provide the following: name and address of firm, size of business, whether they are large or any category of small business*, number of years in business, affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, and prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime)). This information is separate from the capability statement and is not included in the 5 page limitation. Unencrypted responses should be submitted to <a href="mailto:FDC-RFI@mail.nasa.gov">FDC-RFI@mail.nasa.gov </a>  with a copy to <a href="mailto:william.f.cann@nasa.gov">william.f.cann@nasa.gov </a>  e-mail address. Proposal submissions may be submitted via encrypted e-mail (PKI) (recommended if proprietary information is included) directly to <a href="mailto:william.f.cann@nasa.gov">william.f.cann@nasa.gov </a> .  The <a href="mailto:FDC-RFI@mail.nasa.gov">FDC-RFI@mail.nasa.gov </a>  e-mail address cannot receive encrypted e-mail. If so requested in your response, all information received from this RFI will be considered confidential and proprietary; however, NASA intends to use responses to inform our portfolio investment and potential acquisition strategy. Proprietary and export controlled information should be marked appropriately in your response to the RFI. Respondents are advised that NASA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. NASA may contact respondents to this RFI if clarifications or additional information is desired. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This pre-solicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Submittals shall be compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements concerning limitations on export controlled items. Respondents will not be notified of the results. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps.gov for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice with the intent to solicit to a single source to Engineering Dynamics Corporation (EDC) under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) because EDC is the only known responsible source as the original developer of the software product described in this notice and is uniquely qualified to perform updates and technical support of its proprietary software as described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to perform the anticipated work.</p>
<p>Background<br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) first purchased the Human Vehicle Environment (HVE) software from EDC in 1997. The NTSB uses the HVE software to simulate highway accidents. The software application is used to simulate surface vehicle dynamics and accident depictions. The software has the ability to model full scale vehicle dynamics, road conditions, terrain, and vehicle crash interactions within a simulation.<br /><br />The NTSB has a requirement to purchase the HVE software update/technical support renewal for the three (3) HVE software packages registered to NTSB for a base year of twelve (12) months, and up to four (4) option years, each year comprised of twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>Required Capabilities<br />The HVE software renewal includes software update/technical support to several unique features not known to be available in other surface vehicle dynamics and accident depiction software. The EDGEN is a calculation tool using positions and velocities to determine the time required to travel between each location. The EDVSM is a 3-D simulation tool of motor vehicle under various surface conditions. The EDSMAC4 software program has the ability to simulate multiple vehicle impacts in a single simulation. The DyMesh analysis capability in the SIMON software program allows for a simple finite element model and has the ability to model ABS systems and complex tire capabilities such as competing demands in a lateral and longitudinal direction at the same time. In addition, the HVE software renewal includes software update/technical support will allow sidewall contacts that will allow modeling of impacts with curbs and when a vehicle runs off the road, sinks into soil or flips over. Finally, the HVE software renewal includes software update/technical support that can also model truck brake fade.</p>
<p>Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full technical capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a ten (10)-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by NTSB. Parties must submit information within seven days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office to Wendy Kwong, Contract Specialist via email at: wendy.kwong@ntsb.gov. Please note: The NTSB email server accepts up to 15 megabytes per email, including attachments. For this reason, separate emails will be accepted.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought Notice

This is a Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 â€“ Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997).  It constitutes neither a Request for Proposal nor an Invitation for Bid.  It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This RFI / Sources Sought Notice IS NOT A SOLICITATION or an expression of intent to issue a solicitation of any kind in the future.  It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than to gain the information requested.  Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI / Sources Sought Notice.
  The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response and is in no way obligated to respondents by or for any information received.

BACKGROUND, SCOPE, AND CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS:

The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk (FLCN) is requesting information to identify possible sources to provide non-personal husbanding support items and services for the following four (4) geographic regions: Mexico; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), to include all western U.S. territories; Caribbean (excluding all U.S. territories); and East Coast Continental United States (ECONUS), running from Maine through Texas, to include all eastern U.S.
 territories.
  
A â€œDRAFTâ€ Performance Work Statement (PWS) is posted in conjunction with this RFI / Sources Sought Notice.  

The anticipated period of performance for each of the above-mentioned, separate requirements is a base period of one year with four (4) one-year option periods.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 488310 â€“ Port and Harbor Operations and the applicable size standard is $38.5 million.  Again, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This is a market research tool.  The input provided will help the Navy ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of potential businesses both small and large. If you are an interested business, FLCN would appreciate your assistance in providing a Statement of Capabilities to include the following:

1) Full business name;
2) Cage code and Duns Number of business;
3) Name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information;
4) Size of business [based on the applicable NAICS code];
5) Statement as to whether business is actively registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov);
6) Statement as to whether business is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign owned, please indicate country of ownership);
7) Recent, relevant experience.
  Describe ability to support the scope of the requirement(s).  Include brief description(s) of any prior experiences that best illustrates your companyâ€™s qualifications related to performing husbanding support services.
8) Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements (to include any foreign companies); 
9) Prospective small business utilization percentages (if the acquisition is not set- aside for small business); and
10) Compliance with FAR 52.219-14 â€“ Limitations on Subcontracting.*

*Market research results will assist the Government in determining whether these requirements will be full and open acquisitions or small business set-asides.  If a requirement is determined to be a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply.
  Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply.  Potential sources are encouraged to submit recommended small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value for consideration, in the event the acquisition is not set-aside for small business.

If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.
 If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.

<DESC>Description: The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br> Work includes all labor, equipment, and materials to build a 58,400 SF addition connected to Building 34023 where approximately 35,000 SF of the addition is laboratory workspace.  A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), reinforced concrete foundation, floor slab, structural steel frame, masonry walls, and metal roof system, includes high-bay laboratory maintenance area with two bridge cranes, 10 tons and 30 tons permanently attached to the building, enclosed vehicle staging area with doors and ramp accessible to the taxiway, office space, and exterior paved parking.   Work will provide laboratory workspaces designed and constructed in accordance with JAFAN 6/9, including; perimeter security/alarm notification system, security control systems, and floor to ceiling (STC50 rated) interior walls.  Includes minor renovation of the existing FME space to allow connection to the new addition. Demolish one facility (877 SM).  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Christa.LProctor@usace.army.mil no later than by 1000 hrs EST on 24 February 2015.  <br>

<DESC><p>You are cordially invited to participate in the Combat Air Force (CAF) Advanced Live Operational Training (ALOT) Industry Day and Discussion on 25 February 2015 at the Research Park facility located at 1900 Founders Drive, Dayton, OH 45420. You will gain insight about ACC/A5TR's CAF ALOT requirements, status and challenges. Briefings will be held in the theater room, located on the first floor of the building. It is suggested to park in the learning center parking lot and the room can be accessed near the door entrance. Attached is an area map to provide directions for parking.</p>
<p>As weapon systems have become increasingly complex, so have the environments in which they are expected to operate. The global development and proliferation of technologies that pose a credible threat to 5th Generation aircraft have created the desire to analyze ways in which aircrews can effectively train by engaging in Advanced Live Operational Training (ALOT). The ALOT capability will use constructive entities injected into airborne training participants to replicate the anticipated complex threat environment and maximize live training effectiveness.</p>
<p>Initially, ALOT will include Live aircraft and Constructive elements only. ALOT is anticipated to eventually evolve and integrate with other CAF weapon systems and virtual training opportunities in Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) to create a Live, Virtual and Constructive Operational Training environment (LVC OT). The ALOT system, or system of systems, is expected to include three major components: (1) a Source of Constructive Injects (e.g., Ground-based, Airborne, Lead Ship) capability to generate a Common Operating Environment (COE) and constructive entities in the training scenario (2) a waveform to pass COE information to all training participants, and (3) an aircraft capability that would translate the COE information into aircraft-specific useable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The CAF ALOT effort will investigate capabilities and concepts associated with:</p>
<p>&bull; Leveraging technical advancements to generate, transmit, and insert constructive entities into live operational training in the following range of complexity: <br />&bull; Non-integrated constructive injects: Constructive entities injected into the aircraft displays; this will be layered with live sensor information. <br />&bull; Integrated constructive injects: Constructive entities injected into the aircraft fusion systems.<br />&bull; Full integration of live and constructive injects: Fully integrated system fusion to blend live and constructive entities seamlessly, and includes onboard systems working collaboratively with the pilot for threat reaction and response. <br /><br />Technical concepts of interest are any modified commercial, government, or allied off-the-shelf systems and new technology developments assessed at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for operational employment in 2025.</p>
<p>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Attendance at this workshop is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. Please direct any questions regarding the CAF ALOT Industry Day and Discussion to Maj David Satterfield, ACC/A5TR, (757) 225-7068 or david.satterfield@us.af.mil.</p>

Therefore, to maintain compatibility with existing data collection systems, hardware mounting devices, and databases of historical pressure measurements, it is required that the same make and model transducers be purchased.  There are no known alternatives to the Kulite transducers that satisfy these requirements. <br>

<DESC>On 23 January 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District, Contracting Office issued an award for $2,760,267.49 to Vectrus Systems Corporation, 665 Space Center Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80915-3604 for the continuation of operations and maintenance (O&M) services for Afghan National Security Forces' (ANSF) facilities located in the provinces and districts throughout Northern Afghanistan under contract W912ER-15-P-0005. <br>  <br> Subject award was issued as a Bridge Purchase Order for 41 days to prevent a disruption in O&M services.  A competitively awarded follow-on contract, W912ER-15-D-0001, was awarded on 13 January 2015 to IDS International Government Services, LLC with a full performance start date of 14 March 2015.  Award of this contract action to any other source other than Vectrus would not only result in unacceptable delays in services, and substantial costs that would not be recovered through competition, but could also degrade the structural integrity and basic facility operating systems (power, water, and sewer) of the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) facilities.  Additionally, the de-lay would impede ANSF's ability to take full responsibility to sustain and operate its facilities as the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) prepares the ANA and ANP to provide competent and capable leadership for an effective defense force in Afghanistan. <br>  <br> This short-duration, interim, bridge contract requires the contractor to furnish all labor, services, supplies, supervision, materials, tools, equipment, spare parts, warehousing, inventory control, security, transportation, and other items necessary to perform O&M services and systems and infrastructure support at basic ANA and ANP standardized facilities such as ANA brigade camps, ANSF medical facilities, and ANP police stations, located in various sites in Afghanistan.  Routine, traditional O&M support consists of the following services:  operation, maintenance, repair and minor construction of real property facilities; ancillary engineering design services in support of the operation, maintenance, repair and minor construction of real property facilities; standard utility locater services; scheduled and unscheduled maintenance; minor pest control; equipment inventories, condition assessments; emergency services such as restoration of power, water and sanitation; preventative maintenance; O&M manuals; property accounting and control of real property; and environmental services.  The contractor is responsible for all planning, programming, administration, management, supervision and execution necessary to provide the O&M services. <br>  <br> The performance period for the continuation of O&M services is 01 February 2015 through 14 March 2015. <br>  <br> All services under this contract will continue to be performed at various sites in Afghanistan. <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br> Comments regarding this action are due by 4PM 27 February 2015, Eastern Standard Time (EST), by e-mail to DeEtra Warchola at the following e-mail address:  deetra.c.warchola@usace.army.mil.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The e-mail subject line shall state:  W912ER-15-P-0005, Notice of Sole Source Action. <br>

The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance and Price.   <br>  <br> The Technical element of the evaluation will be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation.  The Technical element of the evaluation shall be based solely on information furnished by the vendor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement.  If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to conform to the requirement of this solicitation, the offeror shall include a clear description of such proposed modifications and clearly mark any descriptive materials to show modifications.   <br>  <br> Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed product to industry or Government agencies.  Past performance will consider the ability of the offeror to meet technical specifications, delivery schedules (with warranty fulfillment and maintenance reputation included as applicable).  Offerors shall include three (3) relevant records of sales from the previous nine (9) months.

The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least *2 DAYS* days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the proscribed date may not be considered. <BR> <BR>Availability of Funds (Apr 1984) Funds are not presently available for this contract.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for rigid, CubeSat electric field booms accordingly: <P> Specifications:  Rigid Cubesat Electric Field Booms <P> The purpose of these booms is to deploy sensors from a three-axis stabilized small spacecraft (6U Cubesat form factor). The sensors will gather electric field measurements for use in studies of the Earths ionosphere. <P> Requirements: <P> 	Boom stowed volume: not to exceed 400 cm3, with no single dimension larger than 8 cm including sensor, for the stowed assembly. <P> 	Boom deployed length: at least 1.5 meters.  Longer preferred. 	Boom diameter: no larger than 1.27 cm. <P> 	Maximum mass including harness and sensor: 600 g.  Lower preferred. <P> 	Must support a small, electrically isolated sensor (nominal design shown in Figure 1) consisting of a sphere of minimum diameter 2 cm, with an inboard cylindrical stub (no shorter than 1.25 cm) and an outboard cylindrical stub (no shorter than 1.25 cm). GSFC will supply the sensor, and will develop it in collaboration with the vendor to ensure mechanical integration. <P> 	Must deploy an internal harness within the boom, with at least 5 conductors, each conductor suitable for carrying at least 10 mA in vacuum. This harness need not be a coaxial cable  can be a ribbon or flat cable. <P> 	Must have a resettable caging mechanism (Frangibolt or similar OK, although TiNi or other SMA preferred) to prevent boom deployment during launch. No pyrotechnic devices permitted. Caging mechanism must also retain sensor unit. <P> 	Boom must deploy and position sensor in a repeatable and stable fashion within a full cone angle of 0.5 degrees with respect to the nominal direction, under thermal effects consistent with solar illumination in a low earth orbit, and air drag pressure corresponding to nominal values at altitudes of 250 km or higher, at orbital velocities of 8 km/s, all in zero-g. Rotations of the sensor about the boom cylindrical (long) axis are OK  the requirement relates to the elevation and azimuth of the sensor from the deployer housing relative to the nominal deployment direction. <P> 	If motor-driven, must require no more than 2 W per unit, for no more than 5 minutes to deploy. Desirement: Deploy with 2W at +5V or +3.3V. 	 Deployed length and deployment status must be measured via microswitches, position encoders, or other appropriate devices. Positive indications of both caged / stowed and deployed / fully deployed status required in addition to deployed length, accurate to within 1 cm. <P> Must survive GEVS random vibration in fully stowed/caged state. <P> Deployed Resonant Frequency > 0.5 Hz. Higher preferred. <P> The bending stiffness (EI) of the deployed boom elements must be at least 5 x 103 lb-in2 <P> The surface of the outermost portion of the boom (length > 6 cm) must be conductive and have an attachment point for electrical connection to the internal wire harness. Conductive surface must be atomic oxygen resistant  gold, TiN, or AlTiN. This can be a surface treatment, need not be a bulk conductor. <P> Outgassing of materials shall have a total mass loss (TML) of < 1% and a collected volatile condensable mass (CVCM) of < 0.10%. <P> Seeking quotes with line items for cost to deliver 1, 2, or 4 units: Delivery of at least one unit within 6 months of award; 		Optional second unit delivered no later than 9 months after award.

<p><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:<br />52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical Acceptability_______________________<br />Past Performance ___________________________</p>
<p>Price______________________________________ <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS.<br />Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its contents. A proposal that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements. Such proposals may be determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>After review of initial proposals by the contracting officer, the Source Selection Evaluation Board will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the offeror's technical proposal. Prior to being considered for award, an offeror shall fully demonstrate that it possesses the capabilities which the Government has determined essential to the reliable, efficient and timely accomplishment of the required products and/or services.</p>
<p>Award will be made using the Lowest-Price, Technically-Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process. Award will be made to the offeror which submits the lowest price, technically acceptable product and has an acceptable record of past performance.</p>
<p>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors. The following factors will be evaluated:</p>
<p>PART I: Technical Capability - Technical Capability reflects the Government's confidence in each offeror's ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements as stated in this Combined Solicitation-Synposis. No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments/equipment will be considered. The Government will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets all minimum requirements with the solicited Brand Name item, or an item "EQUAL" to the Brand Name item. Proposals that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, the Government will determine that it does not.</p>
<p><br />The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating each offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION<br />RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: Any offeror receiving a rating of "Unacceptable" for Technical Capability will no longer be considered for award.</p>
<p>PART II: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that in conducting present and past performance evaluations, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal, any other source available to the Government and data obtained from other sources to include, but not limited, to data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. <br /><br />After the Government has evaluated Offerors' past performance for recency and relevancy, the Government will evaluate Quality of Performance (how well the contractor has performed on contracts).</p>
<p>The Government will assign an Unknown /Neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably, to Offerors with no recent/relevant past performance record or the offeror's performance record is not available or the information is inadequate such that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>In this context:</p>
<p>"Recency" - To be recent, some portion of the performance effort must have occurred within 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.</p>
<p>"Relevancy" - Relevant performance includes products or services that are the same or similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to the effort described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in evaluating each offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION<br />RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has a reasonable expectation that<br />the offeror will successfully perform the<br />required effort, or the offeror's performance<br />record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has no reasonable expectation that<br />the offeror will be able to successfully perform<br />the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have "unknown" past performance. In the context acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>PART III: PRICE Price will be evaluated separately from the technical and past performance factors and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability in terms of the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>Price analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offeror's proposal, but will not be scored. The Government is interested in proposals that meet the requirements with acceptable risk, at a fair and reasonable price. Offerors are cautioned that an unrealistically low price, unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially, or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal, either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an imprudent offer.</p>
<p>Paragraph (b) is hereby supplemented with the following: Options is not applicable to this procurement and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum to FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p><br />Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an Open-Market Combined Synopsis / Solicitation for equipment as defined herein. Offers will be reviewed exclusively based upon information submitted. If the information submitted does not address all the requirements as required in this combined solicitation-synopsis, the offer will be rejected. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation that will include the terms and conditions that are set forth herein. In order to facilitate the award process, ALL proposals shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a proposal based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the proposed price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the proposal. Due to the difficulties in receipt of mail through normal postal services, it is required that proposals be sent via E-mail to the POC for this requirement, at ivan.jones@nih.gov the Offeror is responsible for ensuring receipt by the POC.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Any questions received after the above mentioned date and time will not be considered. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before April 2, 2015.<br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD: The government intends to award a fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the below described evaluation criteria. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned about obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical and management quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations. These factors are listed in their relative order of importance: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Factor I, Technical Capabilities: a. Contract Requirements: Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, food and beverage, AV equipment, Business Center, and comply with the reporting requirements. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities. b. Location: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of quoter to provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, and a metro station within a ten (10) minute walking distance. Additionally, restaurants must be within a short walking distance (10 minutes or less) of the proposed facility. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area. c. Availability of Dates: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference, (i.e., 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, 3rd choice date, etc.).</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide references for a minimum of three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of government agency and other non-government client;<br />2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting officer or other point of contact;<br />3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable;<br />4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and<br />5. Description of services provided. List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary).</p>
<p>A quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available; the quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided.</p>
<p>Site Visit: The EEOC will conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Supplemental Agreements: If any hotel submitting a quotation has any supplemental agreements, those agreements must be submitted with their quotation. If the hotel requires signature of a supplemental agreement that was not submitted with the quotation, the quotation will be rejected.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award.</p>
<p>Applicable Provisions and Clauses: The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote.

A. Background:

The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) located at 3601 S. 6th Ave,, Tucson, AZ 85723, has a requirement to replace the current feeding tube real time tip tracking system. Due to advances in technology the current operational system is being upgraded by the Corpak Medsystems, Inc. and the disposable supplies and older equipment will no longer be available. The upgraded operational systems affords SAVAHCS the ability to provide a safer placement, with real-time bedside confirmation of correct placement and reduced patient exposure to X-ray and potential infection if transported to X-ray. Additionally, these newer upgraded systems are proven to be more economical for hospitals with dramatically reduced need for X-rays, fewer complications or adverse events.

B. Requirements:

"	An electromagnetic transmitting stylet and feeding tube real time tip tracking system that generates a real-time signal as the feeding tube is inserted and advanced to the desired placement.
"	A Smart Receiver Unit (SRU) that receives the signal from the transmitting stylet as it is tracked through the placement procedure.
"	All -in-one monitor with integrated visual display terminal (VDT) that is touch screen and embedded computing system. The all-in-one monitor triangulates the signal from the SRU and displays a real-time representation of the feeding tubes tip's passage as it proceeds down the esophagus and into the preferred placement position.
"	Disposable Enteral Access System Electromagnetic Transmitting Stylet and Ultra-Lite Feeding Tube.

CORTRAK 2 EAS (CORTRAK 2 Enteral Access System):
CORTRAK 2 EAS Monitor - CORTRAK 2 EAS Receiver Unit - Stylet Interconnect Cable
Operator's Guide - USB Flash Drive - External Power Supply - Receiver Unit Stabilizer
Calibration Stylus - 2.5mm Allen Wrench - Warranty

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute to be resolved IAW FAR 52.233-1, Disputes Clause, which is incorporated by reference in 52.212-4(d) of this CSA.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This CSA authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on <br />CSA# FA8773-09-C-0059.<br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area. The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract. Contractor?s shall adhere to the following process. A list of foreign national employees shall be provided to the DPG Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security Offices at least five (5) working days prior to arrival on post. A copy of the list shall also be submitted to the Contracting Officer or an appointed Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR). The list will contain name, nationality, green card and social security number, date of birth, drivers license number and state where issued. The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post. If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place. Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete. Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact. The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least *2 DAYS* days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the proscribed date may not be considered. <BR> <BR>Availability of Funds (Apr 1984) Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 202-372-8447<br />Phone: 202-475-5786<br /><br />More information about the Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/business/ombudsman.asp<br /><br />Alternative Point of Contact: <br />Crystal Taber, Contracting Officer<br />USCG, ALC<br />Email: crystal.g.taber@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 252-334-5242<br />Phone: 252-335-6895</p>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909  NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program  It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).   Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.   Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).   Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.   The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for an airbag system that is capable of meeting the basic requirements described below.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.    <br>    <br> DESCRIPTION:  <br>    <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is seeking a domestic source for energy dissipating airbags, to be used with a specific cargo aerial delivery platform, for test and evaluation.   <br>    <br> The U.S. Army has recently proven the concept of modifying the United Kingdom's Medium Stressed Platform (MSP) to function with U.S. C-130J aircraft.  The platform uses airbags integrated into the structure to dissipate impact energy upon touchdown in lieu of energy dissipating material (EDM, aka honeycomb) currently used by the U.S.  The concept of using airbags instead of honeycomb is believed to benefit the U.S. Army by reducing impact forces to cargo, thus improving cargo survivability.  <br>    <br> REQUIREMENTS:  <br>    <br> The desired airbag design should consist of a cylinder made of impermeable fabric, sandwiched between two mattress boards, with a one-way valve on the bottom and an orifice on the top.  See the attached file 'Airbag Assembly.pdf'  for a picture representing the desired airbag configuration.  The impermeable fabric cylinder shall be collapsible for storage and expandable during deployment.  The cylinder will most likely be reinforced with wire or flexible rod to improve the hoop strength.  The mattress boards shall be made from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch plywood or similar and are attached to the cylinder with ties or other type of replaceable fasteners.  The bottom board shall be furnished with a one-way valve through which the airbag is inflated by ram air during descent, much the same way a parachute is inflated.  The top board shall be furnished with a sacrificial patch that covers the orifice.  Upon platform touchdown, the airbag is compressed, increasing the air pressure, causing the sacrificial patch to burst.  During compression the orifice controls the air flow exiting the cylinder, slowing down the load to the ground.    <br>    <br> The platform to which the airbags will interface is the United Kingdom's (UK) Medium Stressed Platform (MSP).  See the attached file 'MSP Assembly.pdf' for an illustration of the platform. The MSP is constructed of three longitudinal channels (one channel on each side and one center channel) and twenty-three (23) transverse channels.  The top of the transverse channels provide the surface to which the cargo load is secured.  The airbags are located beneath the transverse channels, between the longitudinal channels.  The top mattress boards of the airbags run along the ledges of the longitudinal channels and are tied in place.  The bottom mattress boards are held in place by the platform's skid doors.  Between the two side channels and the center channel are two slots that accept the airbag assemblies.  Each slot holds up to six (6) airbags, for a total availability of twelve (12) airbags.    <br>    <br> OTHER REQUIREMENTS:  <br>  - Textile materials used for airbag construction must meet the requirements of the Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2533a.   <br>  - The MSP has an all up weight (AUW) range of 6,000 to 18,000 lbs.    <br>  - See the attached file 'Airbags Deployed Live Drop.jpg' for a photo of the MSP, under canopy, descending towards the ground with airbags fully deployed.  <br>  - It is anticipated an Industry Day will be held at Fort Bragg, NC during 18-19 Mar 2015, to examine and document the airbag system.  Invites to this event will be based on responses received from this RFI.  Vendors are asked to keep that date available should this event occur.  A submission to this RFI does not guarantee an invitation to the event.    <br>    <br> REQUESTED INFORMATION:  <br>    <br> Vendors who believe they have the ability to develop product(s) capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than five (5) pages total) summary, including description of the vendor's ability to develop a custom airbag, source materials intended to be used, and prototype delivery estimates, as well as pictures, website, and test report(s), as applicable.  The five (5) page summary must include Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, Cage Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999 - All other miscellaneous textile product mills and the small business size is 500 employees.  <br>    <br> Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such information. Responses to this notice are to be sent to the RFI POC below. This notice is for market survey only. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement.   <br>    <br> POINT OF CONTACT (POC)  <br>    <br> Interested parties shall submit responses to this RFI to:  <br>    <br>  Jean Greenwood   <br>  Phone:  (508) 233-6101   <br>  Email: jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br> Questions concerning this RFI may be addressed by contacting:   <br>    <br>  Jean Greenwood   <br>  Phone:  (508) 233-6101   <br>  Email: jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br> Responses shall be received no later than 4:00PM EDT 9 March 2015. Responses shall be e-mailed to the address above.  No telephonic or hardcopy responses to this RFI will be considered.    <br>    <br> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  <br>    <br> All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers for contract and will not be used by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<p>The government intends to solicit this requirement subject to full and open competition following Best Value source selection procedures. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) contract type with a Performance Incentive Fee schedule is anticipated. The performance period will span five (5) years and include a one (1) year base, two (2) one-year options, and two (2) one-year award term options totaling 60 months, if all options are exercised.</p>
<p>An Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause (OCI) as defined by FAR 9.505 will be included in the resultant solicitation and contract whereas Third Party Advanced Planning prime contractors must be a separate entity from the prime maintenance activity executing the planned work. Execution work includes current Multi-Ship Multi-Option (MSMO) primes and primes competing for evolution strategy prime opportunities for a given ship class. Separate corporate entity could be achieved by separate business units or organizationally separate parts of the same parent company that are separate profit centers. Any subcontracting opportunities may remain available but subject to OCI and proper mitigation plans. The contractor shall certify compliance with the OCI clause or present an acceptable plan to neutralize any potential OCI. <br /><br />The places of performance under this contract include, but are not limited to, the following Fleet Concentration Areas (FCAs): South East Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC), Mayport, FL; North West RMC (NWRMC), Everett, Washington; South West RMC (SWRMC), San Diego, CA; Norfolk Ship Support Activity (NSSA) RMC, Norfolk, VA; Hawaii RMC (HRMC), Pearl Harbor, HI; and NSSA Detachment Mediterranean, Naples, Italy which consists of NSSA Detachment Bahrain, Manama Bahrain and Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) Rota, Spain. The contract size is estimated by total planned product (or depot level work item) development volume. This volume is defined by work items that typically support Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) type availability planning, and work items that support Continuous Maintenance (CM) planning.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 3 is issued to provide answers to industry questions:<br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong> NAVSEA distributed a presentation for an Industry Day for surface ship modernization, maintenance and repair contracting strategy. One slide in the Industry Day presentation indicates that the execution strategy for DDG/CGs will be different for availabilities under 6 months than it will be for drydocking availabilities and availabilities over 6 months. Will this strategy affect the size and scope of the soon to be released RFP for FY15-FY19 Third Party Advanced Planning support for DDG 51 and CG 47 Class Ships with regards to the number and types of availabilities that the awardee will conduct planning for? If so, what is the impact?
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> At this time, the Government does not anticipate any changes to the scope of the DDG/CG Third Party Advanced Planning contract as a result of the upcoming Industry Day to be held on 22 August 2014 in Washington DC. The types and number of availabilities that the Third Party Planning contract will cover is based on the CNO schedule and the actual award date.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Will release of the 3rd Party Planning RFP for CG/DDGs, slated for late August 2014, be affected by the 22 August 2014 Industry Day which seeks input for this family of contracts?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> At this time, the Government does not anticipate any impact to the solicitation release date as a result of the Industry Day. The solicitation is undergoing DASN (AP) Peer Review and will be released as soon as approval is received.</p>

1. Who would be installing the artwork? The Contractor will be responsible for installing the artwork. 2. During the 2 year lease who would be liable for the artwork? EPA will assume liability for any damages of the art work while it?s in the possession of EPA. 3. Who would be responsible for removing original artwork from frames and putting into new frames? The Contractor will be responsible for all preparation necessary, including reframing if required. 4. Would the EPA be open to donated artwork along with leased artwork? EPA will accept work that has been donated to the   Contractor, however, the Government is unable to accept donations. 5. Is this reserved for Indian owned businesses? The EPA is not currently anticipating setting this aside for tribally owned businesses, however, we reserve the right to later decide to set this aside if deemed appropriate.

<DESC>The following questions were received and answers are being provided.
<p>Q1: Can an offeror install additional infrastructure components and/or reference additional Virtual Machines in the virtual sandbox?</p>
<p>A1: Potential offerors are directed to KPP K4, which states in part &lsquo;All data (accessed, modified, derived, manipulated, etc.) shall remain stored in the SOF data layer only.' The Government understands that some minor additions to the API could be made in order for the proposed ASAE software tool to function correctly. If an offeror chooses to add something, then that will be evaluated. If an offeror chooses to propose a capability based on their business model and if it does not meet any KPP or too many other requirements in the FRD as described in the solicitation attachments, they will receive a score accordingly.</p>
<p>Q2: Will the Ad Hoc training support (Train a third party maintainer...) take place at more than one location or at a single location? If it is more than one location, are they in more than one geographical location? Will the training of the new equipment vendor (computer-based training) be concurrent with the third-party maintainer's training or will it require a separate trip?</p>
<p>A2: The ad hoc training support will take place at a single location, MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida. The training of the new equipment vendor and the training of the third-party maintainer will be two separate training events as the trainings are different and the new equipment vendor and third-party maintainer are two different companies. The number of trips taken to complete the two trainings is up to each offeror.</p>
<p>Q3: As part of the integration into the DCGS-SOF environment the contractor is required to comply with all DISA STIG and SOF Group Policy requirements and it appears that the software will be installed on more than one network, will both networks be using the same set of STIGs? Can an offeror assume that once the software goes through the DCGS-SOF Development Test Environment and the Staging Environment it can get installed on any other DCGS-SOF networks?</p>
<p>A3: Yes, the same set of STIGs are used for each network. Yes, once the software goes through the DCGS-SOF Development Test Environment and the Staging Environment, it can get installed on any other network.</p>
<p>Q4: For pricing purposes, does each of the networks have its own test and staging environment or is that a one-time process and then just install the software on the other networks?</p>
<p>A4: The test and staging process will occur once and then the software can be installed on the other networks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Approval has been granted by GSA to allow BLM to enter into a short term sole source lease extension with the incumbent landlord without full and open competition for continued occupancy.&nbsp; The BLM has a continuing need for 10,633 rsf/ 9,246 usf of quality office space and 52 surface parking spaces located at <span style="background: black; mso-highlight: black;">200 South 10 East Highway 27, Burley, Idaho</span>, under BLM&rsquo;s delegated lease authority, lease number <span style="background: black; mso-highlight: black;">L99PL00011</span>.&nbsp; Delegated authority was requested by BLM and subsequently granted by GSA to allow BLM to acquire a short term lease extension of a three (3) years term ending <span style="background: black; mso-highlight: black;">October 30, 2017</span>. </span></p>
