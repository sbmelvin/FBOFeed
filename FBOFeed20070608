<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) Submission. This is a notice of contract action. The 667 Aeronautical Systems Squadron  (667 AESS) is contemplating the issuance of a Sole Source Contract with  Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Company, Orlando, Florida. No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be  construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or  ultimately award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or  indirect costs or charges to the government will arise as a result of a  response to this notice. Authority:  The statutory authority, which permits other than full and  open competition for this acquisition, is 10 United States Code (USC)  2304(c)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This authority is  supported by an approved J&A. The program office plans to issue the RFP 15 days from this publication  and award this contract by 31 December 2007. The Government anticipates awarding a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract  for thirteen (13) Production Units of the GMS2 System.  The contract is  planned for these systems, readiness spares (turrets and essential Line  Replaceable Units), aircraft wiring, associated data, and three years of  Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  This effort to modify the last 13  AC-130U aircraft in the fleet is virtually identical to the previous  effort procuring four GMS2 systems.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design-Build Construction Services for the new Tuttle Annex Building, Atlanta, Georgia.  

The Design-Build Contractor will be competitively chosen using the Advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202) and Design/Build Selection Process (FAR 36.303).    

PROJECT SUMMARY:  The project is located in the Fairlie Poplar Historic District in downtown Atlanta Georgia,  adjacent to the Tuttle Building which houses the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The properties consist of two existing 5 story office buildings (96 Poplar Street and 70 Fairlie Street) and a vacant lot fronting Poplar Street and Cone Street. These properties occupy approximately 75% of a city block in the city of Atlanta bordered by Fairlie Street, Poplar Street, Cone Street, and Walden Street. The two existing buildings to be rehabilitated are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and both are contributing structures to the Fairlie Poplar Historic District.  The project site itself is highly constrained and is located in a dense urban area of Atlanta. 

The objectives of the project are to provide administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta, Georgia. The administrative office space will be physically linked with the court facilities through  a cut-and-cover tunnel, under Fairlie Street.  The office space will be provided by  connecting the new annex and Tuttle building, rehabilitation and adaptive use of two existing five story office buildings containing approximately 134,000 gross square feet with approximately 24 basement parking spaces, and a new one story loading dock - building entrance over basement parking on a vacant lot adjacent to the two buildings. A portion of the basement parking area will be developed under one of the existing buildings.  The project will also provide innovative technologies and features which will support improved occupant productivity, energy conservation, space flexibility, reliable systems operation, sustainability, and low maintenance. To enhance security, vulnerable portions of the exterior envelopes of the existing buildings will be reinforced and the heavy wood frame structures of the existing buildings will be modified to address blast uplift and floor alignment issues and the mitigation of progressive collapse.  All design and construction work must comply with local, state and Federal government codes and standards.

The General Services Administration is using the ?Bridging? Design Build method to deliver this project. The Bridging contract drawings and specifications have been completed by the bridging architect, Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow and their consultants. These documents and other documents, constituting the Bridging contract documents, will be available to the firms submiting in Phase II. The Architect and Engineers of record will be members of the selected Design Build Contractor?s team. Construction will not commence until final construction documents are reviewed by GSA and a Notice to Proceed with construction is issued.  

The Bridging contract documents will define all of the GSA requirements for critical design elements of the project and will include final space plans, interior finishes, performance criteria for major building systems and other design information.

The project includes: Replace and install new windows. Roof replacement. complete new space build-out including new interior partitions and finishes, new mechanical systems, new electrical systems, and new plumbing systems. The Bridging Contract documents anticipate that the first floor heavy timber floor structure of the 96 Popular building will be demolished and replaced with a new floor that aligns with the first floor of the 70 Fairlie Building. The new floor height will allow enough ceiling height for vehicular parking spaces under the 96 Poplar Street building. The basement area of the 96 Poplar Street building will be modified to accommodate vehicle parking and the tunnel under Fairlie Street to the Tuttle Building. A one story covered loading dock and building entrance will be constructed on the existing vacant surface parking lot. The loading dock will include an enclosed area for service vehicles, area for waste containers, enclosed storage, and vehicle entrance to the ramp that provides the only access to the basement parking area. The employee entrance will contain an entrance lobby, a security check-in area, and mail room. The basement of the one story covered loading dock will contain below grade vehicle parking and a ramp. A pedestrian tunnel will be constructed under Fairlie Street connecting the new annex to the existing Tuttle Building. The area of the two existing historic buildings to be rehabilitated is approximately 123,000 gsf while the area of new construction - one story loading dock and building entrance totals approximately 11,000 gsf for a total project area of approximately 134,000 gsf.  

The design of the interiors of the project represents ?state of the art,? twenty-first century office environment. The new loading dock and building entrance located in the surface parking is designed to be aesthetically compatible with existing adjacent buildings and the urban context of the site. The exterior of the existing historic buildings are intended to be models of successful preservation and rehabilitation. The project will be designed and constructed so that a LEEDS silver certification can be obtained.

The total design and construction cost for this project is estimated between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure Machinery Control System (MCS) upgrades on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis as part of the DDG-51 Ship Class DDG Modernization program.   The MCS upgrades will consist of Universal Control Consoles (UCCs) and Data Interface Units DIUs. The MCS consoles to be upgraded include the Propulsion and Auxiliary Control Console (PACC), Electric Plant Control Console (EPCC), Shaft Control Unit #1 (SCU1) console and Shaft Control Unit #2 (SCU2) console.  The upgrade shall include all specified hardware necessary to integrate with the legacy engineering space equipment onboard in-service DDGs.  A competitive solicitation is expected to be issued shortly.  The MCS upgrades shall be designed to allow the Government to leverage the basic existing Government computer programs from the DDG-51 new construction program.  The MCS hardware shall be designed to limit the impact to the existing in service ship cable plant, power and cooling sy!  stems and limit the duration of ship down time for the installation.  The MCS hardware design shall avoid the requirement for hull cutting during the installation and maximize the utilization of existing cabinetry already on the ship.  All hardware proposals will be considered, including proposals to provide upgrade kits for the existing consoles as well as alternate proposals to completely replace the existing consoles.  The hardware design, merged with the computer programs, shall allow the Navy to achieve a single watchstander in the Central Control Station (CCS) spaces during Condition III watch by leveraging the automated functions built into the computer programs. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitiations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Some technical specifications (including Attachments A and B) to this solicitation include a Distribution Statement D marking, meaning access is restricted to DoD and DoD contractors only.  In order to control access to these documents, they can only be accessed through Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  Access to this system will require a username and password and should be obtained by any interested parties by completing the registration process on the FedTeDS website.  A FedTeDS Ve!  ndor User Guide is available on the FedTeDS homepage.   This procurement will include a basic requirement for a first article test unit, two shipsets, data, and engineering services with options to procure up to sixteen (16) FFP units and three (3) training site sets that may be exercised over the five year contract period.   	No industry day is planned for this procurement.  A draft solicitation is being released with this announcement in FBO for industry review and comment.  Available technical specifications will be posted on FedTeDS.  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a trade off analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final solicitation.  Industry is also requested to comment on the requested warranty provisions.  Comments should be provided within 21 days of the posting of this announcement.  A competitive solicitation will be issued after comments have been evaluated.   All inquiries should be emailed to tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

The Sole Nature of this Award: The Sly Fox Rapid Prototyping (SLY FOX) Mission 9 will be involved in the rapid development of !  an unmanned Wing in Ground (WIG) effect hovercraft systems to help combat the asymmetric terrorist threat. The vessel will consist of a combined hovercraft and wing-in-ground effect (WIG) vessel with the capability to carry various payload types. In order to meet the rapid development schedule, the WIG effect hovercraft system kit will need to be procured and delivered by July 15, 2007 to NSWCDD or within 45 days from date of the award. The rapid development nature of the SLY FOX project does not allow for time to design, build and integrate the many different components required for the frame, engine, and wing; so they must be available commercially in kit form. The items to be procured are components of a remotely controlled WIG effect hovercraft system.  Essentially the items to be procured are the actual vessel itself, which consists of the hull, propulsion, hover, wing, and control systems.  Other items will be integrated into the vessel including motor controls, servo!  s, autopilots, various sensors, turret, and turret controls. Currently , there are several companies who manufacture hovercraft or separately WIG vessels capable of meeting some of the requirements. However, only the UHT-19XRW Hoverwing, by Universal Hovercraft Technologies meets the required capabilities.  The primary distinction of this manufacturers design is the combination of hovercraft and WIG capabilities into one vessel.  The Government requires this Hoverwing combination to meet its mission requirements.  Additionally, UHT holds the patents and license for this type of vehicle. The equipment and services will be acquired utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The closing date will be 12 June 2007 with an anticipated award date of 15 June 2007.  The NAICS Code associated with this procurement is 336612.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology: PNNL researchers have developed a sensor that can characterize a particle or fiber suspension, which may be of particular interest to those in the papermaking industry. When refining wood pulp for paper, the mechanical action of the rotation and grooved circular refiner plates produces a pulp-fiber slurry. The sensor monitors the slurry settling process using transducers on each side of the settling vessel. One transducer acts as a transmitter and other acts as a receiver. The signal in the receive transducer is affected by the pulp passing in front of it and essentially measures the pulp concentration. A peak in the signal occurs at a specific time, called the "peak time." The results show that the peak time is dependent upon the degree of refining, or the amount of time in the refiner. Consequently, the ultrasonic sensor can determine the degree of refining, making the refining process more efficient. While this method was developed for wood pulp, it is applicable to many other mixtures where determining the appropriate size or morphology of fairly large particles is desired. Advantages include (1) increased efficiency of the refining process and (2) real time monitoring of particle or fiber characteristics during the settling process. A detailed description of the technology is provided in U.S. Patent No. 7,140,239. Note:THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology. Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations. Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

This design effort includes the design engineering, stress analysis, and the update of associated drawings (kit and manufacturing) to reflect the new configuration.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Ridley Park, PA for an estimated period of performance of eight months after the date of contract award.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<CONTACT>Jeffrey C Ginsberg Contract Specialist 718-741-4243
<DESC>Statement of Work Histotechnologist Services VA New Jersey Health Care System East Orange Campus Introduction and Scope of Work  VA New Jersey Health Care System is committed to providing quality care to our Veteran population.  The mission of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service is to provide timely test services to the clinicians for the diagnosis and treatment of all veterans.  The services provided are comprehensive and reflect a national standard of practice.  In order to meet the clinical needs of our patients, the East Orange Campus is seeking contract services for one (1) Histotechnologist. This requirement is needed due to the retirement of one Histotechnologist and the imminent departure of a second one. This will leave the Anatomic and Pathology Department with only one Histotechnician and one Cytotechnologist.  We have been given permission to hire one Histotechnologist and are in the process of recruiting.  However, due to the scarcity of Histotechnology programs and thus Histotechnologists, we anticipate that it will take long time to find a qualified candidate.  We will soon be in desperate need of immediate help.  An agency Histotechnologist would be of great help during this time. The Scope of Work involves processing, embedding, cutting, routine and special stains, immunohistochemistry, frozen sections, and collecting surgical and cytology specimens.  It also involves monitoring control slides, using and maintaining equipment and troubleshooting when necessary.  It also entails logging in all surgical pathology and cytology material accurately into the computer and preparing specimens for shipment for outside consultations. 2.  Requirements   The Contract Histotechnologist will be full time and work from 7:30am to 4:00pm, Monday through Friday. The Contractor will report to the Anatomic Pathology section of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service. The contractor will be responsible for performing a variety of procedures such as processing, cutting, embedding, routine and special stains, immunohistochemistry, and frozen sections including MOHS biopsies, cytology preps and monitoring control slides. The contractor will also clean, maintain, troubleshoot and utilize all equipment safely, including the cytoprep, autocyte, cytospin, tissue processors, paraffin baths, cryostat, microtomes, automatic stainers, and cover slipper.  The contractor is also responsible for maintaining and running controls with special procedures to check any discrepancies which could cause false results and take necessary action to correct false positive results. The contractor will also log all surgical pathology and cytology materials accurately into the computer, set up and monitor quality control, prepare reagents, controls, and standard solutions, verify correct instrument operation, and calibrate instrumentation when necessary.  Workload, quality control, and quality assurance data will be recorded in the appropriate logs. The Contract Histotechnologist must adhere to all training requirements specified as "Mandatory" for the laboratory staff, including but not limited to HIPAA, Information Security, etc. within the timeframes required by the VA Medical Center Director. Timeliness Requirements Surgical specimens from the previous day are to be finished (embedding through staining) by 11:00 am the following day. Frozen sections are to be finished within 15 minutes. Re-cuts and special stains are to be completed within 24 hours of the pathologist's request. Cytology preps are to be done within 24 hours of receipt of specimen. B.  Reporting Requirements The Contract Histotechnologist will log all surgical pathology and cytology material accurately into the computer using VISTA for record keeping and physician information.  All workload will be recorded in the computer and Quality Control will be documented in the appropriate logs. C.  Documentation Requirements:  The Contractor will enter workload into VISTA. The Contractor will identify the patient specimen from receipt through slide labeling. D. Workload Data:  Historical data demonstrates approximately 5200 surgical, 40 autopsy and 2400 cytology (GYN and NON-GYN) accessions per year. No significant increase or decrease in workload is anticipated. E. Facility Data:  All services rendered by the Contract Histotechnologist are to be performed at the VA New Jersey Health Care System East Orange Campus, using Government-owned space, utilities, materials, and equipment. The Contract Histotechnologist is prohibited from bringing contractor-owned equipment and materials on Government-owned premises, unless specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.       F. Place of Performance:  The contractor shall provide services at the VA New Jersey Health Care System East Orange Campus, 385 Tremont Avenue, East Orange, NJ 07018. G. Procedure for Referral and Scheduling:  Specimens for Anatomic Pathology are brought to the lab accompanied by a Tissue Examination Form SF 515.  This form is used for both cytology and surgical pathology specimens. Requests for re-cuts and special stains are requested by the Pathologists in the Special Stain Log Book. H. Transfer of Patients:  Not applicable. I. Patient Safety:  The Contract Histotechnologist will adhere to VHA, VISN 3, Facility Handbooks and departmental procedures regarding patient safety and the policies for reporting adverse events. J. Exchange of Data:  Clinical information will be exchanged using Vista and CPRS. K. Billing:  The contractor will submit a weekly signed time sheet of hours worked indicating date, hours worked less lunch period, and total hours. This time sheet will be verified by the Administrative Officer, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service or designee.  On-Call/Holiday Coverage:  There will be no on-call or holiday coverage or overtime payment. No additional payment will be made for this coverage.  L. Payments:  Reimbursement will be based on documentation of on-site hours worked on condition that compliance with all other contract requirements is demonstrated by the monitoring methods as described herein.  M. Penalty for non-Performance:  If services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no additional cost to the Government, if appropriate.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:   Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and/or Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. Non-performance with the terms of the SOW may result in replacement of contract personnel and/or termination of services. N. Reimbursement Method:  Reimbursement will be FTE based. O. Educational and Research Activities:  No educational or research activities are required or permitted under this contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment # 1
1)To inform that Middlesex-Essex, MA was removed from Form A on this solicitation.

The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification  and specific project of design/build firms. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify design/build on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified firms by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested design/build firms must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: Design/Build (3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 20 million, $20 to $40 million. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified design/build firms in each of the defined geographical areas. 

Note: Contractors who are now prequalified for a given area or dollar amount(s) are not required to submit or resubmit a qualification package.  Contractors who wish to prequalify or contractors who wish to add new areas or dollar amounts must submit a qualification package.

The Postal Service will select the most qualified design/build firms utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Design/build firms that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.     A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $20 million, and $20 million to $40 million.

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $20 million, and $20 million to $40 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution.  New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the design builder are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.

Prequalified design/build firms will be automatically notified for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. The solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its. Sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Firms shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firm?s prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness. 

A preproposal meeting will be held at 9:00 am on May 31, 2007 at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Conference Room first floor, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

Qualification packages are available now and may be obtained by email request to Jose L. Carrasquillo at jose.l.carrasquillo@usps.gov or Bill Powell at bill.powell@usps.gov or written request to either at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

Amendment 1 issued to add the following statement: Hand-carried proposals (or proposals sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Submittals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Qualified Vendors List 2007, Attn: Connie Houpt; due 2:00 p.m. CST, June 21, 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, is re-establishing its Qualified Vendors List (QVL) used for FAA procurements for the manufacture of modification kits.  These modification kits are used primarily in navigational aids, communications, radar, weather, and environmental areas in support of the National Airspace System (NAS) equipment to improve the safety and system/equipment reliability and supportability.  To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  Existing QVL vendors must respond to this announcement by providing all required information for evaluation. (A) The QVL is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  The FAA Acquisition Management System defines a small business as, "... a business, including it's affiliates, that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing the products or performing the services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the Federal Government's criteria and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards."  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 334511 (750 employees).  Vendors shall complete and submit the Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1) with required documentation. (B) Vendors must have a manufacturing facility located within a 200-mile radius of MMAC at time of this announcement.  The address of the manufacturing facility shall be provided at time of submission of documentation.  This requirement is for the purpose of providing technical guidance, monitoring manufacturing processes, witnessing factory tests, monitoring packaging procedures, and identifying potential problem areas in a timely manner. (C) Vendors shall submit a description of their capability to meet the following seven criteria:     1. Technical Documentation - supplier catalogs and/or Internet access for research and acquisition of supplies and materials;     2. Manufacturing Capabilities - fabrication and manufacturing capabilities;     3. Test Capabilities - equipment needed to provide power to circuit inputs and measure resultant outputs of fabricated mechanical, electrical, and electronic items;     4. Packaging and Labeling Capabilities - equipment and materials needed to meet FAA packaging and labeling requirements as found in ASTM-D-3951, ASTM-D-4169, and MIL-STD-129 (Attachment 2);     5. Quality Control - quality control system that complies with FAA-STD-013d, Quality Control Program Requirements (Attachment 3);     6. Logistics and Inventory - sufficient space for receiving, assembly, storage, and shipping of modification kit parts and supplies; and     7. Software and Firmware - capability in-house or have sources for software and firmware needs.   This documentation is limited to a maximum of ten pages for all seven criteria.  To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be provided, along with a name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the following address:  FAA/MMAC, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125, Attn: Connie Houpt, AMQ-210, with reference made to Qualified Vendors List 2007, by 2:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, June 21, 2007.  If required, a subsequent SIR will provide further qualification criteria to enable the FAA to evaluate and then down-select vendors for the QVL.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of vendors selected for the QVL.  Data submitted that is found to be false will result in permanent removal from consideration for this QVL.  The contracting officer will dispose of incomplete packages without further action unless an inadequate number of responses are received. The FAA reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey with companies interested in this requirement.  Special consideration may be given to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses for participation in the QVL. All vendors being considered for inclusion on the QVL must meet the criteria for determination of responsibility as defined in the FAA's Acquisition Management System.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must:    1. Have adequate resources (financial, technical, etc.) to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them;    2. Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, considering all existing business commitments;    3. Have a satisfactory performance record;    4. Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and    5. Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. The FAA reserves the right to request business and financial references to aid in the determination of responsibility. Re-establishment of this QVL will be a unilateral decision of the FAA and will be reviewed annually.  The FAA reserves the right to include additional vendors on the QVL.  The decision to remove a vendor from this QVL will be based on performance and the ability to be competitive.

This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days.

The Act authorizes the conduct of studies in areas or regions of sales to determine the "environmental impacts on the marine and coastal environments of the OCS and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas development."  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is the administrative agency responsible for leasing submerged Federal lands. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires use of the natural and social sciences in any planning and decision making that may have an effect on the human environment.  To this end the MMS develops and participates in Environmental Impact Statements (EIS), environmental assessments (EA), and other decision documents.  To support these efforts the Environmental Studies Program (ESP) conducts needed studies in the range of relevant disciplines including physical oceanography, fate and effects, biology, protected species, social science, and economics.  The studies may be on marine environment data acquisition and data analysis, literature survey, monitoring, and socioeconomic analysis.  The ESP also holds information transfer meetings periodically and workshops on special selected topics as needed. The MMS Scientific Committee reviews the MMS ESP annually and the National Research Council reviews it periodically. The MMS ESP continually attempts to maintain the highest scientific standards by working with and responding to their recommendations.  MMS released the Proposed Program Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 in August 2006.  It proposes eleven lease sales, in which six (6) in the Central Planning area and five (5) in the Western Planning area.  Information from this study will be used in the preparation of EIS's, post sale EA's for these sales and EIS's and EA's for Development and Production Plans in the leased areas.  This study, Analysis of the Oil Services Contract Industry in the Gulf of Mexico Region, will help MMS meet the requirements of the OCS Lands Act and NEPA.  Examination of the oil services contract industry in the Gulf Of Mexico Region (GOMR) will provide a basis for future economic analysis in MMS NEPA documents.  In particular this study will provide information and data that will update the MAG-PLAN economic model.  MAG-PLAN (MMS Alaska-GOM Using IMPLAN).  MAG-PLAN is a Microsoft Access-based, 2-stage model that uses OCS-specific "cost functions" to estimate the industry expenditures required (by industry sector and onshore incidence of spending) to complete a given activity, such as drilling an exploration well or operating a production facility.  The second stage uses general economic multipliers of the commercial economic modeling system IMPLAN to forecast employment, personal income, and other variables resulting from the initial industry expenditures.  IMPLAN is a commercial input-out-put software and data package widely used to estimate the effects of new spending on the economy.  Contractors for MMS created MAG-PLAN in 2005 which is used to forecast employment and other variables.  MAG-PLAN uses Exploration and Development scenario inputs which are primarily infrastructure components, such as miles of pipeline, number of wells, and so forth.  The oil service industry is distinct from the integrated and independent oil companies. Contractors perform a wide variety of tasks such as drilling, processing drilling mud, well service and work over. They engage in rig, pipeline, and platform construction. Oil service industry contractor's account for roughly 60 percent of all offshore employment resulting from first-round industry spending in the Gulf of Mexico, yet the Agency has only a limited understanding of this very important industry group. In recent years, this group has become even more important as more and more functions are contracted out - a trend that is likely to continue in the future. PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for a study that will develop an understanding of oil services contract industry in the Gulf of Mexico Region (GOMR).  Specific objectives of this study are to:  1) identify and describe industry expenditures and employment in the oil services contract industry, including how they are distributed throughout communities in the GOMR; 2) identify the types of functions that are being contracted out, the characteristics of the firms that are contracting out the functions (i.e. discuss differences between majors and independents in using contract labor); and the characteristics of the service contractors; 3) examine differences by sectors, size and other appropriate characteristics; and 4) examine how the role of contract labor in performing the different functions has changed over the past decade and examine functions by sector. STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS: Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise and knowledge of economics of GOMR, oil and gas industry economics, labor economics of GOMR, and economic modeling.     This expertise and knowledge must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable in scope and size to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications. SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a response with approximately 20-page or less that provides information about the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES:  Your response must be delivered as: one (1) original plus three (3) hard copies and two (2) electronic/diskette copies (CD MS/Word/PDF), total of four (4) hard copies and two (2) CDs.  Response due date:    not later than close of business (COB), 5 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), 9 July 2007 at the address below: One (1) Paper copy, One (1) original signed copy and one (1) electronic diskette copy (CD MS/Word/PDF) to: Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service Procurement Operations Branch MS 2500, 381 Elden Street Herndon, VA 20170 Attn: Ms Olivia F.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR INSIDER THREAT DETECT SOLUTION TO DETECT AUTHORIZED USERS WHO CONDUCT MALICIOUS ACTIVITY WITHIN A NETWORK OR ON A SYSTEM.

SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for an Insider Threat Detection solution that can be deployed on hosts and networks enterprise-wide across the DOD.  Traditional efforts to secure networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security.  While such defenses as network firewalls and Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, there is an equally damaging threat posed by those who have access to information systems and networks that operate from within.  The activity of the ?insiders? would not normally be detected by the security measures in place.  The Insider Threat Detect solution will provide the functional capabilities for more aggressive insider data gathering by detection technology not normally a part of network management or security within a computing environment.

For the purpose of this RFI, an ?insider? is defined as anyone who uses authorized credentials to access a DOD computer and/or network; regardless of whether or not those credentials were acquired through legal channels.

The types of insider ?unauthorized? activities include, but not limited to: exceeding permissions through host policy violations, conducting malicious activities, providing unapproved access, circumventing security controls, unintentionally damaging resources, and accessing or removing data without authorization or in an inappropriate manner (also referred to as exfiltration or extrusion).

A potential Insider Threat Detect solution can be any combinations of security products collecting activity data (i.e. correlator) from host agents installed directly on network end-points (e.g. local host workstations, servers, routers, etc.) and from Network Sensor feeds.   In order to be effective across enterprise networks, a proposed solution utilizing host-based deployment capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, data collection, updating, and configuration using the Host Based Security System (HBSS) Central Manager.  For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used:  

Host Agent:  This portion of the solution is a light-weight host agent that collects user and system activity such as user profiling and policy violations.  These actions, when taken together, may be classified as normal activity, bad behavior, accidental actions, or potentially an insider with malicious intent.  The local host agent communicates through the HBSS central manager to the Correlator.
Correlator Console:  This portion of the solution correlates data from the host and network data feeds, log files, and other available sources.  The Correlator Console is specifically designed to enable the identification of variations in authorized user behavior profiles as well as potentially suspicious insider activities on either the host or network.  
Network Detector: The network detection portion of the solution identifies when user?s activities depart from normal user activities.  In addition to being useful in detecting anomalous insider activity, the detector is also useful in detecting outsiders who have successfully penetrated the network and are acting as an authorized user.  Network detection capabilities may be software only using existing sensor collected data.
HBSS Central Manager:  The HBSS Central Manager (ePolicy Orchestrator from McAfee) is an established DOD Enterprise tool that is designed to provide centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based IA capabilities.  An Insider Threat Detect solution that utilizes a host agent security product is envisioned to be managed by the HBSS Central Manager.   

Solutions to this RFI can have any combination of the above security products.   For an example, a solution can have just a network detector and a correlator that are capable of meeting any combinations of the System Capabilities, while another solution may contain all of the three security products listed above.   Other potential solutions can have a totally innovative design and security products offering while still meeting some or if not all of the system requirements.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):

HQ Scott AFB/A7KQB is in the process of determining acquisition strategy for a follow-on contract for the sustainment of 42 Civil Reserve Air Fleet Aeromedical Evacuation Shipsets (CRAF AESS).  The team is soliciting responses from interested sources to determine capabilities to perform the follow-on contract.  We would appreciate any feedback industry has to offer.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The CRAF is a group of B-767 aircraft owned and operated as commercial aircraft by large air carriers such as TWA, Delta, and USAir.  These aircraft form an integral and extremely important element in the aeromedical evacuation plans during a national emergency or conflict.  These aircraft can be activated by the Secretary of Defense any time it is deemed to be in the national interest.  When activated the aircraft are given a short period of time to be configured and delivered, and be at the full disposal of the Air Force.  While the aircraft are still owned and operated by the air carriers and crews, they are assigned to perform military missions.  The aircraft are operated under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations and the aircraft captain has the authority to determine whether or not the aircraft meets the FAA specifications at any time.  Since the aircraft will always be operated according to FAA rules and regulations, all equipment and procedures used aboard the aircraft must also be in compliance with FAA rules and regulations.  

The AESS was designed for use on the B-767 aircraft as a conversion kit which allows the aircraft to be used as an aeromedical evacuation platform during times of conflict or peacetime disasters.  The CRAF AESS consists of three major subsystems: 

     a.  The patient transport subsystem ? freestanding litter stanchions that accommodate 3 patients per stanchion (87 patients total) which are independently attached to existing aircraft seat tracks.  NOTE:  The baseline configuration for the aircraft includes accommodations for 10 medical personnel, 6 flight attendants, and up to 40 ambulatory patients (in seats).
     b.  The medical oxygen subsystem ? consists of six 75-liter oxygen dewars (450 liters total) and a heat exchanger installed on a single pallet in the forward cargo bay using existing cargo fittings for tie-down.  This subsystem provides therapeutic oxygen to support a 12-hour mission with 60% of the patients using oxygen.  The converted oxygen is routed to a management panel in the main cabin via oxygen hoses routed through existing vent openings on the left side of the aircraft.  The oxygen is then routed along the aircraft main deck at 300psi via oxygen hoses attached to the litter stanchions.  Oxygen manifolds attached to the litter stanchions reduce the pressure to 50psi for use by the patients.  Emergency oxygen will be provided by standard dixie cup masks that are on oxygen lines extended to reach the lower litter tier.
     c.  The aeromedical operations subsystem ? consists of 2 nurse workstations, a regulated 60Hz electrical power supply, and storage facilities.  Electrical power from the 400Hz aircraft power bus is converted through six 5kW 400-to-60Hz converters and routed through the right side of the aircraft.

Each shipset weighs approximately 20,000 lbs. and is stored in 21 large, individual crates in an environmentally controlled government warehouse currently located in Ft. Worth Texas.  Each shipset has a 20? W X 16? L X 16? H footprint and contains components that require periodic inspection and preventive maintenance to assure that operational readiness is maintained.  

The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  

The shipsets have been designated war readiness material and are critical in nature.

Contract Requirements: 

1.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the CRAF AESS in a constant state of operational readiness and will provide technical and logistical assistance in support of shipset deployments.  As FAA certified equipment, the CRAF AESS must be under the control of an entity known as a Designated Alteration Station (DAS).

2.  The successful contractor shall provide all direct material in support of storage, inventory, inspection, preventive maintenance, repairs, STC maintenance, hardware modifications, shipment, installation/de-installation, refurbishment, unpacking/repackaging of shipsets, and other tasks necessary for sustainment of the system.  All materials shall conform to FAA approved data including any inspection and certificates applicable to the materials furnished by the contractor.

3. The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the CRAF AESS Installation/Instruction Manual to keep it current.

4.  Activation of the shipsets is possible at any time.  The successful contractor?s installation team will be required to install shipsets into B-767 aircraft, given an arrival rate of two aircraft per 24-hour period.  A range of 1 to 40 shipsets could be activated, depending on Government need and the urgency of the situation.  Upon activation, the contractor will be responsible for transporting shipsets from the storage location (currently in Fort Worth, Texas) to the contractor's installation facility.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.
 
5.  It is anticipated that a training exercise of the CRAF AESS will be conducted once every 2-3 years.  In addition to transporting and installing a shipset from the storage location to the contractor?s installation facility, the contractor will be required to transport a Government-owned patient loading system to support the exercise.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.

6.  The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the STC sealed drawing package.  The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under STC control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  The successful contractor shall also update or supplement the STC documentation as necessary and ensure the STC is not compromised through changes to the CRAF AESS or to the assigned B-767 aircraft.  The successful contractor shall follow the Systems Engineering guidance as found in ASC/EN Systems Engineering Guide, 5 April 1996 and FAA Advisory Circular AC 21-40, May 6, 1998.  

7.  The CRAF AESS is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system because the oxygen used for the patients on board the aircraft must be medically safe to use.  Therefore contractors must follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  The GMP regulation covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging, storage, and installation of all devices.  The GMP regulation is codified in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820 contains general quality assurance (QA) or quality system requirements in areas of concern to all manufactured devices.   

8.  Preventive Maintenance Inspections (PMI) will occur under a varying schedule depending on the asset and FAA rules.  For planning purposes, the PMI schedule ranges from every 6 months to once every 5 years.


CONTRACTOR CAPABILITIES NECESSARY TO PERFORM CRAF AESS SUSTAINMENT:

1.  Be licensed by the FAA as a DAS and be licensed to perform work on B-767 aircraft.  As FAA certified equipment the CRAF AESS must be under the control of a DAS.  DAS designation and FAA licensing are a major requirement of the successful contractor.  Please discuss whether or not your company is DAS qualified or if your company has the potential to become DAS qualified in order to perform AESS maintenance.  If FAA licensing will have to be acquired, how long do you anticipate the licensing process to take?  What are the anticipated costs, if any, to the Government for obtaining the required licensing?

2.  Ability to obtain a station license modification, which adds CRAF AESS sustainment and installation/de-installation.  Obtaining a station license modification may require the successful contractor to provide a B-767 for an installation demonstration for the FAA.  Discuss your capability in meeting this requirement.  

3.  STC maintenance.  See contract requirement above for maintaining the STC configuration.  Discuss the feasibility of obtaining the STC and the timeframe/cost associated with initiating this process in order to perform as the successful contractor for the follow-on CRAF contract.  

4.  Expertise in handling/operating/servicing large liquid oxygen systems.  The Liquid Oxygen Storage Subsystem (LOSS) is a major component of the CRAF AESS system and requires specific expertise to ensure it is maintained in accordance with contract requirements.  Please discuss whether or not your company has expertise in handling large LOSS systems.  Discuss your experience in adhering to GMP as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  See contract requirement listed above.    

5.  Facilities.  The successful contractor must be able to provide a hangar and a runway capable of accepting B-767 aircraft at any time as well as sufficient space to park up to three B-767 aircraft while two aircraft are undergoing modification.  Please discuss whether or not your company has sufficient facilities and/or capabilities for accommodating the required numbers of B-767 aircraft in order to perform CRAF maintenance/modification.  If you do not currently possess the facilities, how will you obtain facilities in order to meet contract requirements?

6.  AESS activation.  The successful contractor must have the capability (during a national emergency) to provide the facilities, equipment and personnel to transport and install shipsets at the rate of 2 aircraft every 24 hours beginning not later than 48 hours after activation notice.  If these facilities differ from those described above, provide a description of your facilities but also explain how you will accomplish this task with the proposed facilities.  Since the AESS is currently stored in a government warehouse in Ft Worth Texas it is preferable that the contractor?s facilities be within the contiguous United States.  However, the government is interested in entertaining other ideas with respect to AESS storage, location of contractor?s facilities, while still meeting all contract requirements. 

7. Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA).  Describe your ability to obtain parts manufacturer approval for the CRAF AESS components.

OTHER:

1.  The rough order of magnitude for CRAF AESS sustainment (contractor logistics support) follow-on contract is estimated to be between $7 - $9 million, assuming no aircraft are activated.  Activation and exercises are to be pre-priced, preferably at a firm-fixed price, subject to Government need and availability of funds.  The follow-on contract would either be a basic year plus four 1-year options or a multi-year contract for 5 years.  

2.  L3 Communications Integrated Systems (formerly Raytheon E-Systems) is the developer, manufacturer, and current maintainer of the CRAF AESS. 

3.  It is requested that interested/potential sources respond to the capabilities outlined above in sufficient detail within 20 days from the date this notice is published in Fed Biz Ops.  Please submit your responses to Ms.  Kelly Wavering, kelly.wavering@scott.af.mil, Contract Specialist, HQ AMC/A7KQB, 507 Symington Dr., Rm. W202, Scott AFB, IL   62225-5022.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  The NAICS Code is 311611.  The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is seeking information from commercial sources regarding fresh beef products.  Specifically, DeCA is looking for industry input regarding the identity of beef products that are readily available to be priced and put into the meat cases without further processing required (market ready).  DeCA wants to ensure that its current specifications and required core lists are conducive with the production capabilities and availability of most commercial beef suppliers prior to the issuance of any future solicitations.  DeCA currently procures fresh beef products for its 250 military commissaries from commercial beef suppliers through a competitive process.  The requirements for a core and optional fresh beef products are compiled as a program buy on a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The proposals received in response to the RFP are evaluated and a determination is made regarding the proposal(s) that represents the best value to the Government are awarded a contract.  The contract will be the primary source of fresh beef for the commissaries specified within the contract.  Contract performance is normally for a period of three (3) to five (5) years.  Any new beef items or requirements may be added to the fresh beef program buy non-competitively.  This long term arrangement allows both the commissaries and the beef supplier the opportunity to not only obtain and receive fresh beef products at competitive prices but work together with promotional events that enhances sales.  DeCA has changed its beef specifications regarding fat trim from  inch, with no more than  inch at any one point to  inch maximum.  Also, DeCA requires blocked cuts for certain cuts of beef.   DeCA views these changes as labor savings initiatives that reduces the amount of labor required to process the fresh beef products obtained from the supplier to preparing the tray wrapped products in the meat case for the commissary patrons (authorized individuals that shop in the commissaries).  To ensure DeCA's requirements provides the broadest opportunity for participation in the competitive process additional information is necessary for consideration in or adjustment to DeCA's beef specifications.  The following is a list of items core beef items currently being sold to DeCA commissaries: Beef Chuck Shoulder Clod (1 pc), Beef Shoulder Clod (2 pc), Beef Chuck Shoulder Clod (Top Roast), Beef Brisket (Deckle-off),  Beef Brisket (Flat cut), Beef Plate (Inside Skirt), Beef Plate (Outside Skirt), Beef Short Plate (Short Ribs), Beef Back Ribs, Beef Hindshank, Beef Bones, Beef Round (Heel and Shank-Without Knuckle, Boneless), Beef Round (Top Inside), Beef Round (Top Inside Denuded), Beef Round (Outside Round), Beef Loin (Top Sirloin Butt Boneless), Beef Loin (Top Sirloin Butt, Center Cut), Beef Loin (Bottom Sirloin Butt Flap), Beef Loin (Bottom Sirloin Butt Ball Tip), Beef Loin (Bottom Sirloin Butt Tri-Tip), Beef Loin (Tenderloin, Full Side Muscle On, Defatted), Beef Loin (Tenderloin Butt, Defatted), Beef Flank Steak, Beef for Stewing, Beef Coarse Ground (73%, 81%, 85%, 93%, 96% Lean), Beef Coarse Ground Blend (73%, 81%, 85%, 93%, 96% Lean), Beef Fine Grind Chubs (One, Three & Five LB Units, Ground Beef, Chuck, Round, & Sirloin).  The following is a list of Block Cut Items currently being sold to DeCA commissaries: Eye of Round, Beef Chuck Tenders, Beef Rib Eye Roll (Lip on - Boneless), Choice Beef Knuckle Peeled, Choice Beef Rib Eye (Lip-on, Bone In), Choice Beef Short Loin, Choice Beef Strip Loin, Choice Beef Flat Iron, Select Beef Rib Eye (Lip-on, Boneless), Select Beef Rib Eye (Lip-on, Bone-In), Select Beef Short Loin, Select Beef Strip Loin, Angus Beef Rib Eye (Lip-on, Boneless), Angus Beef Short Loin, Angus Beef Strip Loin.  DeCA is interested in receiving information from the beef industry's commercial sources that would be interested in participating in future beef acquisitions.  The following information is requested: Scenario:  DeCA is looking for labor savings initiatives within the meat operations.  In keeping with current trends, some sources have expressed concerns that the  inch maximum fat trim specification and blocked cuts is somewhat restrictive when applied to a full beef line of products.  However, other sources indicate no problems with compliance with the specification.  DeCA is looking to determine what are the industry standards and current trends for fresh beef.  DeCA is also looking to determine what alternatives may be available that would achieve the same or similar labor savings.   
1. What specifications are currently being used for beef products in commercial supermarkets? Identify any "block cuts" you are currently supplying to commercial customers.  2.  What changes can you recommend to DeCA's current specifications that could meet industry standards? Identify all beef cuts that are required by DeCA's specifications that are not readily available in your production facilities as industry standards?  3.  What labor cost saving alternatives would you recommend to help support DeCA's meat operations? Examples may include substitution of one major muscle cut versus several cuts of the same item; pre-priced market ready products, vendor stocking, etc.  4.  Provide your view of the acceptability of market ready products with its increased costs with customers in commercial supermarkets.  
5.  Provide a list of current core (never out) beef products being offered by your company to commercial supermarkets. Discuss whether these items are primals, subprimals, or market ready beef products, etc. Discuss the types of packaging, and shelf life being used for these products. 6.  What is the average shelf life for beef market ready products? If the shelf life differs by location please annotate accordingly. 7.  Provide your recommendation on how DeCA can accomplish maintaining a comprehensive offering of main stream beef products while reducing labor resources. Also, provide comments on how DeCA can maintain the overall beef specifications if limited tolerances were allowed?  Responses to the requested information shall be submitted in writing by July 9, 2007.  In addition to the requested information above, the responses shall contain the following:  solicitation/reference number, requestor's name and address, business size, telephone number, facsimile number, and email address.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile or email.  The facsimile number is (804) 734-8090, Email address: rhonda.mcdougal@deca.mil.

<DESC>BWXT Pantex (Pantex), a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Amarillo, TX, for the Department of Energy?s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is preparing a solicitation to provide construction services to upgrade Pantex?s electrical distribution system.    
The Pantex Plant electrical distribution system is an electrical network that supplies electricity throughout the plant and in outlying areas of the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas.  Electricity is a required utility as the Pantex Plant relies on electrical power to perform the essential functions of the Plant.  The objective of the EDSU project is to replace approximately 19 miles of overhead power lines (includes the removal of 704 existing poles and installation of 549 new poles) and 1 mile of underground conductors; replace 9 generators and 4 UPS with 4 new generators and 2 UPS; and to replace 12 panel boards and 2 air conditioning units.
This project shall provide turnkey Contractor services for Pantex. These services shall be for the equipment / material procurements, construction, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing ?mark-ups?) for the EDSU project.
The scope of this project consists of two major tasks:  (1.) Generator /UPS /Panel board /HVAC Replacement (GUPHR), and (2.) Overhead-Electrical-Power-Line-Replacement (OEPLR).  The OEPLR task shall upgrade most of the Plant?s aging overhead electrical power poles. In addition to power poles, lighting poles will also be replaced in several locations.   The scope of both tasks includes disconnecting operating facilities and reconnecting power.
The successful contractor will be required to submit a cutover strategy plan that identifies how electrical power will be provided to facilities during construction activities and how electrical power will be cut over from the existing system to the new.  The new lines shall be installed such that both systems (new & existing) can remain operational independently &/or connected together. The maximum duration for facility outage to perform the actual cutover is limited and will complicate the execution.

EXPECTED RFP DATE IS JUNE 18, 2007
EXPECTED AWARD AND START DATE IS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007

ALL QUESTIONS, WHETHER TECHNICAL OR CONTRACTUAL, MUST BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO MIKE ALBERS, JALBERS@PANTEX.COM     IF YOU WILL BE RESPONDING TO THIS SOLICITATION, YOU MUST SUBMIT AN EMAIL TO JALBERS@PANTEX.COM ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS SOLICITATION.

<DESC>Responses to questions received for Solicitation VA-241-07-IF-0075 1.	It appears that the architect did not list the drawing scaling on each plan.  On many of the plans there is no indication of what the drawing scales he is using sizes are. What are the drawing scales? Response:  This will be added to the documents by addendum. 3. On drawing 6 of 39 there is a problem with the information on the plan it does not seem to match the scope in the notes.  Specifically there is an area that states that it is general notes.  In it they talk about the work on drawing.  And the note states that all work on this plan shall be done as deduct alternate 9.  While the rest of the plan indicates that the plan is labeled and called deduct alternate 3. Can we clarify what plan is with the alternates?  There is other work mentioned on the plan but it does not match the description or the plan as far as specific. Is the plan bid alternate #3 or #9? Response:  This will be changed to alternate #3 in the addendum. 4. On Plan 6 its call for casework to be installed, but plans don't show any casework.  Response:  Plans indicate modifications to existing casework and the note applies as well to this work. 5.  There is no site plan in the plans so we can't find out where the condensing unit would be located. And where we would be pouring of slabs and so on.  Response:  Part plan F8 on drawing 31-M-401 indicates the location of the condensing unit pad. 6.  Are we allowed to use individual sureties on this project rather then just corporate surety? Response:  Yes, so long as the conform to Federal Acquisition Regulations. 7.   NAICS Code - Why NAICS listed as 238990 and not 238220 as described in description section of synopsis. Response:  Use NAICS Code 238220. 8.   We are considering a Joint Venture with a local mechanical contractor to bid this project. Does CCR registration of the JV required prior to bid date or our notice of intent is acceptable for evaluation? Response:  CCR Registration is required for all awards; it should be not that registration with VET BIZ for SDVOSB is also required. 9.   If we decide to bid as prime and performance bond is likely required, can our mechanical subcontractor provide the bond for the portion of their work and we bond the portion our work (i.e. 80/20)? Response:  Bonds for the project are the responsibility of the prime contractor. 10.  Intends to bid as a Prime Contractor (Joint venture) under the SDVOSB program.  To that end, we have several brief questions: 11.	The solicitation states the contract performance period is 120 days.  We wish to ask if we either could have a "delayed start" in order to submit on all major equipment and have on site or close to being released before our construction time actually starts.  If this is not possible, can the contract performance time be extended to 300 days?  Response:  The contract performance is being extended to state 300 days from the Notice to Proceed. 12.	Can you tell us the when you expect the owner furnished equipment (AC 3 and MSUs) to be delivered to the site?  Response:  We are tentatively looking at the MSU's to be on site NLT November 15, 2007. 13.	Is it possible to get a copy (PDF) of the Ground Floor plan so we can better understand where some of the rooms are located that are referenced in the solicitation as tie in points for the MSUs? Response:  Supplemental drawings are being provided. 14.	We could not make the first site visit.  In the event we feel we need to see the building in order to move forward, would that still be possible?  Response:  Not at the present time. 15.  According to spec section 01150.3.2.A, foundations, several pads, or footings are required, in addition to some small slabs.  According to the manufacture's Site Preparation Requirements, a concrete slab or asphalt slab is required that covers the entire area 40' x 50'.  Please advise. Response:  The installation of the MSU's is a design/build effort which requires coordination with the MSU manufacturer and the VA for connections and locations.  Installation detailing is the responsibility of the contractor. 16.  My understanding from the walk thru was that the VA was going to hire the crane to load the units in and out.  The spec now calls for the contractor to make those arrangements.  Please confirm. Response:  At the present time it is the VA's intention to hire the crane service. 17.  There are no site plans included with the drawings that show utilities.  I understand that the contractor is required to hire an underground locating service; however, a site plan showing the VA utilities in the area would be most helpful.  Please provide a site utility plan of existing utilities.  A pdf file format of site utilities drawing could be electronically transmitted via email. Response:  We don't have a site plan showing utilities, thus the request for utilities locating service.   18.  What is the expected project start date and completion date? Response:  The proposed Notice to proceed will be June 29, 2007 with the completion date being 300 days after the notice to proceed. 19.  Is there any information specifically in reference to the Electrical Contractors Obligations with respect to installation of the Mobile Operating Rooms (MSU) located in (section 01150) as follows: a.	Electric Door Closures- .	Door operators for the connector hallway to the remote MSU buildings (typically 120 volt powered from a Life Safety Branch Circuit with low voltage control pads located on either side of entry). .	Control Relay or contacts Interlocked with Fire Alarm System to release door mechanism (either internally or with magnetic door holders) in the event of a fire (typically 24 volt DC or 120 volt AC).  b.	Medical Gasses- .	Med-Gas Alarm Monitoring on MSU stations. Does this require a 120 Volt Source on a Life Safety branch circuit?  .	Tank-farm Monitoring of Med-Gas distribution. Panel monitoring equipment requiring a 120 Volt source and intrinsically safe low voltage monitoring equipment.  c.	Mobile Operating Room Connector- .	Design specifications on size and location for (2) MSU's. Single connector for both MSU's will increase minimum count of fixtures in reference to lighting (5 ft-candles) required as per specifications. Location of Critical Branch Circuit distribution panel to supply lighting in connector.  d.	Sewer Ejection Pumps- .	Ejection pumps for waste removal due to proximity and location of MSU's (may need addition electrical power for (120/208/480) volt single or 3-phase requirements).  e.	Room B-24-(request for preliminary approval) .	Potential location for 150 KVA dry type transformer mounted indoor with a 200-Amp/600-Volt non-fusible safety service switch. .	Secondary service to be installed to (2)-200 Amp 250-Volt (3-Phase 4-wire) fusible disconnects located on the exterior of Building 31.Disconnects to service individually each MSU hard wired to the power cords supplied by manufacturer.  f.	Additional conduits- .	Underground conduits for the following: i)	Equipotential Ground Loop for MSU grounding and bonding of any associated electrical panels feeding circuits in designated area from separately derived systems. ii)	Telecommunications for CAT5 cable installation to a location yet to be determined. iii)	Fire Alarm for on-board systems to be integrated with main Fire Alarm system of adjacent building. Specifications on system compatibility are required for MSU terminations.  iv)	Nurse Call locations to be connected to an existing system (Hill-Rom or other comparable system). Response:  The MSU's are to be made operational by the contractor through coordination with the MSU supplier and the VA facilities infrastructure in place.  As indicated in specification section 01010, the MSU's are being installed in a design/build format. 20.  In reference to the walk through on May 31st there was some confusion in the scope of work based on drawings Richard Electric received. A pull box exists between building 31 and 32 for the future wiring of ATS31A-6 (a new transfer switch located in building 32), EM31 (an existing emergency panel located in building 32), and EQDP31B (a new panel board installed in the penthouse of building 31). An undetermined number and size conduits need to be known in order to have a feed and load from the transfer switch to be installed in building 32. If only one 3  "or 4" conduit exists then the transfer switch cannot be installed in the designated location utilizing the pull box as a route for both line and load wiring. A remote location (installed in the main electrical room in building 31) may be an alternative thereby only utilizing only one conduit in the pull box.  Please advise to which options the VA would like to pursue. If the transfer switch cannot be relocated or the spare conduits are minimal then an alternate route needs to be addressed.  Response: Notes being revised on the drawings. 21.  Clarification on the classification (as per NFPA-70) of the following areas: Basement .	SPD Contaminated Room (B-14F) .	SPD Decontaminated Room (B-14C) Equipment located in these rooms may need to be classified as hazardous locations. Exhaust fan (EF-2) shows being listed as explosion proof on Drawing # 31-M-601. Panel B14-A, a transformer, and Panel B14-B are located in this same area. Please elaborate on the material located within the room and advise if the equipment needs to be intrinsically safe.  Exhaust Fan (EF-2) also shows being located at the basement level on drawing # 31-EP100A and on the rooftop of drawing # 31-M-601 under the mechanical listing. Is it possible to relocate the exhaust fan outside of the ground floor room? Response:  The explosion proof motor is included due to the motor being in the exhaust air stream. Drawings have been revised to indicate that the fan is mounted on the roof. 22.  Section 15902 Controls and Instrumentation (DDC) refers to the control contractor's responsibility for all work including labor, and materials. Under Specifications [Part (3)/ (3.1) - Installation/ (B)-(1-7)-Electrical Wiring Installation] a reference is made to 16111, Conduit Systems and 16127, Cables for the installation of DDC. Is it the responsibility of the Electrical Contractor to provide pathways or penetrations for the Control Contractor or is this a reference to installation only? Are there any 120 Volt Electrical Dampers requiring a licensed electrician to install them? This area always seems to get overlooked on contract jobs and a clarification is necessary in order to include some labor and material for any areas that may be within our scope of work.  SMRT Response: This is the responsibility of the controls contractor and their electrician. 23.  I am requesting updated Electrical drawings and/or As-Builds for the following areas: .	1st Floor Building 31 .	2nd Floor Building 31 Drawings (# 31-MH102-Note 6) and (#31-M-404-Note 2-Detail (3&5)) require conduits to be relocated. In order to estimate the time and material needed and the extent of the relocation drawings are needed. A verbal explanation may help project the work involved.  Response: These locations and work will require field verification of the scope.  Suggest that an allowance of $2,000 be included for this work.  The second referenced drawing should be #31-M-402 24.  Included in the Basic Methods and Requirements (Mechanical 2.3-Electric Motors-C.) specifications, providing a time-delay relay for poly-phase motors has not been addressed. Are there any motors that require a soft start application and if so are they to be provided by the Mechanical or Electrical Contractor? Response: There are no motors that require soft starters. 25.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This requirement is set-aside for small business only.  The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 333314, Size Standard 500 employees Solicitation / Purchase Request number F2KBAD7134A002 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16 effective 22 Mar 2007.  The Government intends to award 3(three) contract line item numbers (CLINs) as follows:

CLIN 0001: 1 EA, LASCAD Basic Program with ABCD Matrix Code or equivalent.

ABCD matrix algorithm computes spot size and wavefront curvature of Gaussian modes along the optical axis both inside and outside the cavity.
Shows transverse profiles of fundamental and higher order Gaussian modes at individual positions along the optical axis.
Takes into account astigmatism of optical elements in two directions perpendicular to the optical axis to compute the mode shape in the x-z and y-z planes.
Computes important beam parameters, such as: Size and position of beam waist and far field beam divergence.
Shows stability diagrams for modes in x-z and y-z planes for different cavity configurations.
Computes beam quality M2 and higher order transverse modes based on inserted apertures.
Easy-to-use graphical interface for inserting and defining optical elements, such as: mirrors, dielectric interfaces lenses and crystals.  Graphical slider for intuitive adjustment of laser cavity parameters.
Interfaces with Finite Element Analysis FEA program module to insert thermal lens in resonator.
Software must work with Windows XP 64 bit operating system.  Software must be industry standard for interface with research partners.  Software must work seamlessly with other line items.

CLIN 0002: 1 EA, LASCAD with Finite Element Analysis or equivalent.

Computes temperature distribution, deformation and stress in laser crystal, using 3D data of the absorbed pump power density and user-defined boundary conditions.
Interactive 3D graphic display of heat load distribution, temperature, thermally induced deformation and stress.
User ?definable parameters include: laser and pump light configurations, cooling geometry, dimensions, FEA mesh size, boundary conditions and temperature-dependence of material parameters.
Computes temperature-dependent refractive index distribution.
Analyzes thermal effects in composite crystals having doped and un-doped sections or different materials 
FEA results are used with the ABCD matrix code by multiplying the temperature distribution by the derivative of the refractive index versus temperature.
The computed thermally induced refractive index distribution is fitted parabolically at right angles to the optical axis, using the finite element analysis mesh subdivisions.  For the deformed crystal end faces, a parabolic fit is computed.  The calculated parabolic parameters are used to compute the full round trip ABCD matrix and the mode structure. 
Shows overlap of transverse mode profile with the absorbed pump power density.
Computes laser output power dependent on the Gaussian mode shape and pump light distribution.  To do this the rate equations are solved by iterative integration over the crystal volume. 
Interfaces with ZEMAX-EE and TracePro to allow user-defined pump light configurations beyond those included in LASCAD.
Output of FEA can be used as input for ABCD matrix code or Beam Propagation Method. 
Software must work Windows XP 64 bit operating system.  Software must be industry standard for interface with research partners.  Software must work seamlessly with other line items. 

CLIN 0003:  1 EA, LASCAD with Beam Propagation Method or equivalent.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This acquisition will be made as a Brand Name or Equal purchase.  Each quote must meet the requirements defined in FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal, see attached documents.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Solicitation number FA7000-07-T-0173, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16, effective 22 Mar 2007 and Class Deviation 2005-000001.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 334516 and the business size is 500 employees.  The proposed acquisition is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  This Notice of Proposed Contract Action is the only solicitation submitted for this requirement.  No formal solicitation will be issued prior to award.

10 MSG/LGCB has a requirement for an X-Ray Diffraction Unit as follows:

The Government has a requirement to purchase one (1) MPD Theta / Theta Powder X-ray Diffraction System.   The Powder X-ray Diffraction System will be used in  Advanced Laboratory Techniques and Independent Research courses.   A suitable EQUAL must be able to meet all of the following criteria:

a. The Powder X-ray Diffraction System must have a complete radiation enclosure which prevents exposure from either the direct or scattered x-ray beam.  The enclosure must meet all local, state, and federal x-ray radiation safety requirements.  

b. Key lock to prevent unauthorized use of the system.
  
c. Manual adjustment of generator settings available on the exterior of the enclosure.  Generator settings must be restricted and password protected, software selectable, and computer control.

d. Enclosure with front sliding doors for convenient access to the goniometer, optics and sample stage. These doors must lock automatically when the x-ray shutter is open, so that it is physically impossible to open them.

e. Enclosure with safety interlocked hinged rear doors for easy access to the goniometer.

f. An X-ray tube of the long fine focus design (0.4 x 12 mm filament size) with a maximum loading of 2.2 kW.  The tube shall have a copper anode and shall have ceramic insulation that provides superior focal stability over glass tubes.  The tube must be of the high stability variety for the more demanding requirements of a x-ray mirror.  

g. An X-ray  tube and tube shield design which allows for fast and easy changeover between line and point focus operation as required for different analytical techniques in less than 10 minutes, by individuals who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics, without the need for realignment of the tube, optics or goniometer.  The changeover must be accomplished by loosening a locking ring at the base of the x-ray tube, rotating the tube 90a and locking the ring.  Disconnecting water lines as part of this procedure is not acceptable.

h.  An x-ray tube that is constructed with a solid state device that allows the diffractometer/generator control electronics to automatically recognize the model number of the tube when the tube is installed in the system.

i.  An X-ray tube stand which contains an electro-magnetic shutter mechanism with fail-safe interlocks.

j.	Must include an x-ray generator that is capable of 3.0 kW output power and the use of ultra-sonic frequency solid state technology with remote computer control and tube recognition through the diffractometer/generator control electronics.  It must allow pre-set kV and mA values to be used for different analytical programs and also allow the user to program a standby setting (minimal kV and mA) for when the diffractometer is not being used.  Automatic control of all important operation parameters must also be included. 

k.	Generator must have a adjustable kV setting to 60 kV maximum output in 1 kV steps at a stability of less than 0.01% at mains variation of +/- 10%.  The mA setting must be adjustable to 60 mA output in 1 mA steps at a stability of less than +/- 0.01% at mains variation of +/- 10%. 

l.	The diffractometer/generator control electronics must be able to automatically identify the model number of the tube currently installed.  Based on the model number of the tube, the generator will establish and restrict the maximum kV, mA and power settings that can be applied to the tube.  The control electronics must maintain a running log of the usage of all tubes installed on the system.  Each tube will have a separate log file, organized by tube serial number.  Log files will track the hours each tube is used at different power levels, based on a combination of kV and mA.  

m.	Diffractometer must consist of a very stable vertical theta / theta goniometer with a measuring circle radius that  is variable from 170 to 240 mm.

n.	The diffractometer must have independent operation of the drive axes for the tube (omega) and detector (theta) arms.  The angular range of the goniometer must be from -40 to +200 degrees in omega, and from -15 to +165 degrees in theta, depending on accessories. 

o.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System?s goniometer must employ direct optical positioning technology using DC drive motors for the omega and theta axes, 360 degree optical discs bonded directly to the moving axes (tube arm/omega and detector arm/theta) and LED readout banks mounted on the goniometer chassis.  The DC motors and optical positioning technology must be under continuous operation to avoid any possibility of angular drift.  

p.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System should be capable of correcting inadvertent operator induced movements of the tube arm (omega) or detector arm (theta), momentarily pushing it out of its original angular position, the system must immediately detect this and automatically move the tube or detector to its original angular position, with no operator intervention.   The use of an optical encoding system that is not positioned directly on the tube and detector arms, such as optical encoders placed on the gear train or on the drive motor shafts, is not acceptable.

q.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System must use a pre-aligned, fast interchange optics modules for the incident x-ray beam, with each module attached to identical incident beam sub frames (individual).  The optics mounting frames must be made of hardened steel and remounting of optics must be reproducible to < 3 microns.  Interchange of each optics assembly must occur in under 2 minutes by persons who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics and without the need for realignment of the goniometer or optics modules.  The exchange of the modules must be accomplished by the loosening and tightening of no more than one screw, using no more than one tool that is provided with the diffractometer.  

r.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System  must use pre-aligned, fast interchange optics modules for the diffracted beam arm, with each module attached to identical diffracted beam sub frames (individual).  The optics mounting frames must be made of hardened steel and be reproducible to <3 microns.   The Powder X-ray Diffraction System?s interchange of each optic must occur in under 2 minutes by persons who have no knowledge or experience in the alignment of x-ray diffraction optics and without the need for realignment of the goniometer or optics module.  The exchange of the modules must be accomplished by the loosening and tightening of no more than one screw using no more than one tool that is provided with the diffractometer.  

s. The Powder X-ray Diffraction System  must have a programmable anti scatter slit module, for use with the X?Celerator solid state linear array position sensitive detector.  This assembly must have a fixed slit mode with software controlled settings of 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, ?, ?, 1, 2 and 4 degrees and a continuously variable mode with software controlled settings of the irradiated area on the sample from 0.5 mm to 20 mm sample irradiation in 0.5 mm increments.  Each jaw must be under independent control to allow asymmetric illumination and extremely low angle work (less than 0.5 degrees 2theta).  It must be possible to install this programmable anti scatter slit module on the detector arm, along with a parallel plate collimator module, so that the operator can switch between para focusing slit optics and parallel beam optics through software, without the need to physically switch out any optics modules.

t.	The Powder X-ray Diffraction System  must have a Video camera module.  Real time viewing of the sample from the diffractometer host PC during movement must be possible.  Frame grabber software must be included to save pictures of samples being measured.  It must be possible to install this camera on the diffractometer's detector arm, along with a complete set of receiving optics and detector, so that samples can be aligned with the camera and then data collected without having to switch out any optics modules.  To avoid restriction in the angular range of the detector arm, mounting the video camera on the goniometer chassis, positioned above the sample stage, is not acceptable.

u.  Must have a dual detector arm assembly.  

v. The System  must have a rotation stage which utilizes front reference sample holder mounting.  This stage must be operable in both reflection and transmission geometry.  

w.  The System?s operational, data collection, and analytical software must be written and supplied by the diffractometer vendor in order to maximize long term support and enhancement in future versions, and compatibility with potential hardware upgrades to the specific unit that is purchased.  The software must be licensed for installation on 10 computers within a single department at the purchaser's site.  The requirement to use vendor supplied dongles in order to run the software is not acceptable.  

x.  The System  must have the capability to do Hierarchial Cluster Analysis.  

y. The System  must have a controlling computer for the diffractometer system which must be equivalent to, or better than the following configuration.  The use of XRD vendor proprietary boards or interface electronics is not acceptable.  The need to use XRD vendor supplied dongles in order to run the diffractometer or the software supplied with the diffractometer is unacceptable.  It must be acceptable for the USAFA to supply the control PC locally, without the need to ship the PC to the XRD vendor for system integration.  Dell Precision 470 desktop, 2.80GHz XEON processor, with 2MB L2 Cache, 1GB DDR2 ECC SDRAM 400 MHz Memory, entry level USB Dell keyboard, Dell UltraSharp 19" flat panel monitor with height adjustable stand, nVidia Quadro FX 540 128MB dual VGA or DVI+VGA capable graphics card, dual 160GB serial ATA 7200RPM hard drives with DataBurst Cache for RAID, 3.5inch 1.44MB floppy drive, MS Windows XP Pro operating system SP2, Dell USB 2-button optical mouse with scroll, 48X CDRW & 16X DVD+/-RW with Sonic Digital Media and CyberLink Power DVD, Dell AS501 Sound Bar UltraSharp flat panel display, MS Office 2003 Professional, Norton Internet Security 2005 90 day, and Dell 3 year next business day parts & labor on site service contract.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

ENCLOSURE 2; PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR 39 MEGAPIXEL DIGITAL CAMERA KITS 1.0  INTRODUCTION
The objective of the performance work statement (PWS) is to procure four (4) 39 ?megapixel digital (millions of pixels) digital cameras kits, including camera body, digital back, lens, software and accessories for the Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) needs to expand capabilities for the digitization of photographic records in NARA?s holdings by procuring the following.
2.0   BASIC REQUIREMENTS
General Specifications
The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of photographic records in NARA?s holdings. Currently, the Special Media Preservation Laboratory performs preservation reformatting historic photographic prints and negatives by photographically copying and duplicating the originals. Copy photography is done using 4in x5in copy cameras. The primary duplication of negatives is done on 70mm rollfilm using four Maron duplicating cameras. The NWTS Labs are purchasing additional equipment to expand digitization, including to replace copy stands and older Maron 70mm cameras. Currently, the NWTS labs consider the minimum pixel array to replace the 70mm duplication work would be a 6,000 line file (6,000 rows of pixels across the long dimension of the image), as per NARA Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access. To achieve this size image file, the NWTS labs need four 39 megapixel (millions of pixels) digital cameras -including camera body, digital back, lens, software and accessories. The 39-megapixel digital cameras will be used on copy stands for both reflection copy work (of photo prints, documents, maps, illustrations, etc.) and for digitizing transmissive originals (negatives, transparencies, slides, etc.) using a subsurface illuminator.
2.1 EQUIPMENT TO BE PURCHASED
Qty	Equipment and Services
4	39-megapixel Digital Camera Kits, camera body, lens, digital back, software, and accessories (1GB CF card, FireWire cable, battery, & charger)
LOT    On-site Set-up/Configuration, On-site Training, and Support for the above in accordance with Paragraph 2.0 requirements.
2.2 Offerors shall propose equipment to meet the National Archives' requirements and specifications. The selected vendor shall provide all equipment and services to the final approved list and specifications.  The vendor shall ship all equipment to the National Archives at College Park, Metzerott Rd., College Park, MD, 20740. The vendor shall provide on-site set-up of digital cameras and on-site training for NARA lab staff on the operation of the equipment.
General Requirements:
NARA needs four digital camera kits, each with 39-megapixel (million pixels) digital back, with single-shot and 4-shot modes, on an auto-focus, auto-exposure, medium-format camera body with standard 80mm lens for digital copy and studio photography. The camera body shall have interchangeable lens, prism/viewfinder, and back capabilities. The 39-megapixel back shall be usable on other cameras as well (not dedicated to a single make or type of camera).

For best digital image quality for critical copy and laboratory photography applications and quick image capture, NARA needs area-array digital camera backs with 39-megapixels and 4-shot mode. The 4-shot mode produces un-interpolated pixels by shifting the CCD/CMOS array so the same scene location is sampled through the separate filtered photo-diodes (typically red, green, blue, and green filtered); compared to single-shot mode where the CCD/CMOS array is fixed a single pixel is produced via interpolation from four separate filtered photo-diodes sampling the scene from adjacent, but separate, locations on the array. 4-shot mode produces the highest color fidelity and saturation, the lowest image noise level, and the highest possible resolutions as measured by spatial frequency response since there is no interpolation. Scanning or line-array digital backs do not produce digital images with the same low-level of image noise and scan times are too long (ranging upwards of 10 minutes).

I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Police Liaison Officer (PLO) reports to the Department of State?s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and United States Office in Pristina (USOP) to assist in the development, implementation, and management of U.S. foreign policy regarding the continued successful deployment of U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) assigned to the police component of United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and the training, equipping, and continued development of the newly established Kosovo Police Service (KPS).  If and when the mission transfers to the European Union (EU), the PLO will serve the same functions with respect to that mission.  The PLO frequently meets with members of the international community, including police and non-police assigned to UNMIK, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), EU, KFOR (the NATO military force in Kosovo), and various non-governmental organizations (NGO?s) for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to CIVPOL, KPS, and the overall international effort directed at Kosovo law enforcement development.  The PLO is frequently required to attend emergency action committee meetings at USOP and render opinions of overall mission security based on sources such as reporting by relevant UNMIK police authorities.  

Background

Since 1999, INL has managed CIVPOL and local police development programs in Kosovo.  The program currently costs approximately $30 million a year.  The primary program elements include 1) U.S. contribution of American police (currently approximately 220 officers) to the civilian police component of the United Nations Mission (UNMIK).  UNMIK Police are responsible for law enforcement functions in Kosovo until the new police force is established and prepared to assume responsibility for law enforcement throughout Kosovo; 2) logistical, medical and administrative support for U.S. CIVPOL is provided by the Department of State contractor, Civilian Police International (CPI), from building complexes in Pristina and the four outlying regions ; 3) U.S. contribution of trainers (approximately 7) and academy director to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) effort to train some 7,300 members of the new Kosovo Police Service (KPS) at the police academy; 4) U.S. donation of police equipment, supplies and materials via the contractor, CPI; 5) U.S. contribution of two American attorneys to provide advice, guidance and training in the specialized area of criminal codes and associated legal procedures; and 6) U.S. support to the UNMIK Police intelligence and investigative units.  After a possible transition to an EU mission, it is anticipated that only a small number of international civpol officers will retain executive powers, and the remainder will serve as mentors/advisors to the KPS.  It is expected to remain an armed mission.  The management of this complex program and its importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires a full-time person with significant police expertise to monitor and troubleshoot the day-to-day aspects of the program.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a four (4) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-03-D-0006 for husbanding services with Argentina in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional  husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a four (4 ) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-01-D-0299 for husbanding services with Ecuador in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.
	
The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional  husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
06/08/2007


QUESTION 1:  FLIGHT DAYS: By ?flight days? ? can we expect these flight days would be sequential for the entire program (smallest footprint 220 days - one pilot per day ? start at one base until that base complete then start at the next base and so on), sequential at each base only but potentially overlapping the three bases (smallest footprint 120 days with periods where flight days are occurring simultaneously at all three bases), or overlapping to any extent (even up to the ridiculous extreme of 220 pilots all flying on one day.)  The question boils down to ? what is the maximum number of pilots you would require on ANY given day during the period of performance?

ANSWER 1:  Our use of contract pilots is designed to cover extenuating circumstances that are brief in nature.  We may need a contract pilot to fill a vacant slot for only one day in one office during a given period of time.  We may need that same pilot for a series of days ? say 5days and then not again for some time, if ever.  These are not regularly filled positions.  The need is sporadic and temporary in nature.  The amount of duty time or days of involvement will be passed to you when a request for help is published.  Our minimum liability for contract pilots at any given moment will vary significantly from 0 to as many as 3 to 6 throughout the unit.

QUESTION 2:  SIC / PIC:  Would our pilot(s) be expected to be PIC all the time, occasionally, or never?  Since the solicitation allows for class I or II medical, I assume our pilot(s) will be SIC only, never PIC.  Will our pilots expect to land the aircraft all the time, occasionally, or never?

ANSWER 2:  Contract pilots are never given the responsibility of PIC.  They will forever participate as SIC.  As the SIC they will not be given a landing until, in the judgment of the PIC, a positive working rapport has been established and a familiarity with JPATS operating procedures has been gained.  In other words a confidence level has been achieved.

QUESTION 3:  PROCEDURES: I expect they would operate as JPATS crewmembers and abide by JPATS operating procedures ? there are likely many details of those operating procedures that could have significant impact on pricing, likewise, they would be extended the same considerations as the current full time pilots of the JPATS under these operating procedures (such as duty day and flight time limitations that would constitute one complete ?flight day?).  Is there any chance you could forward or make available to me (through a web link possibly) the operating procedures that our pilots would fall under?

ANSWER 3:  Generally we adhere to an 8 hour flight day and a 12 hour duty day.  Our limitations are 38 hours per week, 100 hours a month and 1000 hours a year.  Our flights average 6.5 in the aircraft which usually translates to a 10 to 12 hour duty day.
 

QUESTION 4:  RESOURCES & EQUIPPAGE: Will all flight planning be done at JPATS facilities using JPATS resources and publications?  Will our pilots have at their disposal JPATS in flight publications or will they be expected to bring their own for all eventualities?  Do the aircraft have their own headsets with boom mics OR will JPATS issue these OR will our pilot(s) be expected to have his or her own?  Will our pilots abide by JPATS dress code for flying or will you want them individually identifiable?

ANSWER 4:  JPATS will provide all maps and charts.  All aircraft have headsets, however it never hurts to bring one if it is available.  Our trips are usually four to five stop in duration.  Most are out and back from the point of origin.  We do have occasional over night stops.  The schedule will be made available to the contract pilot so he may know what is expected for a particular assignment.  A short sleeve polo type shirt in gray is what our pilots wear along with black slacks and black shoes or boots.  Ex-airline folks have shown up in a short sleeve airline shirt which is acceptable.  Polo shirts in subdued colors are acceptable (black, white, and blue).

QUESTION 5:  NORMAL FLIGHT PROFILE: The flight profile our pilot(s) would have to support at any given base could range from a ?turn? every day beginning and ending (or at least planning to) every day at the base to one long trip for the entire duration of the expected number of flight days contracted at that base.  What can be expected as the normal trip length or does it vary considerably?  Are there certain locations that you regularly have your crews overnight if they depart on trips or does it constantly vary?

ANSWER 5:  See Answer 1.

QUESTION 6:  TRAINING: In the interest of safety, it would be appropriate to expect some period of training to be provided for our pilot(s) in operating procedures and crew coordination on JPATS flights but there does not seem to be any provision for integration training.  At a minimum I would think a day or two of ground school taught by JPATS to include operating procedures, CRM standards, facilities orientation and a safety equipment and special equipment walk around would be necessary.  Would it be reasonable to assume that JPATS would make the facilities, personnel, and aircraft available to support this in advance of flights with contractors commencing at any given base?
 
ANSWER 6:  JPATS recognizes the liability attendant with the use of contract pilots and to the extent possible attempts to mitigate that liability are made.  We do not provide lengthy ground schools.  We expect to invite professional aviators who have considerable experience and have developed good habits associated with the professional disciplines required to operate in today?s air traffic environment.  The PIC will provide the contract pilot with a briefing which will entail an overview of our procedures, checklists and expectations.  That briefing may take place 2 hours prior to the flight or we may attempt to provide a more complete pre-flight briefing to the extent that all parties are available to participate.  We are quite busy and occasionally understaffed.  If we had pilots available for more extensive briefings, we would not find it necessary to occasionally contract for one. 
As a minimum we require all contract pilots to hold an FAA issued ATP Certificate.  They must be type rated in the aircraft they will be assigned to fly and must be able to show proof of having completed re-current training in the aircraft in question within the last 12 months.  Time in type is preferred.  Trainees (time in type) are an unwarranted liability.  We want to encourage the participation of experienced professional pilots.
 
Currently the majority of our contract requirements are found in Alexandria, LA (B737-300) and Phoenix, AZ (MD83).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability.  When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program.  A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire a Human Resources Specialist within OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The Human Resources Specialist reports directly to the Chief of OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The Human Resources Specialist supervises OTIs PSC human resources team, which supports OTI program-funded PSCs in the area of human resources and employee relations, training, personnel, and travel services.  The Human Resources Specialist manages the operations and administration of all human resource related activities in support of OTI program implementation.

This is a supervisory position.  The position may require occasional international travel and the successful individual must be available to fulfill this duty as required.

The position is being solicited as a tandem/ladder position.  Applicants may submit for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each.  Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level).  If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level.  Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 24 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for this position is to build dedicated capacity for executing human resources tasks in support of OTI's cadre of PSCs worldwide.  A secondary objective is to provide additional backstop supervision capabilities within the OTI Operations and Management Division.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Human Resource Specialist shall manage human resources support and guidance for approximately 70 Washington and field-based USPSC staff, in addition to a number of field-based Foreign National PSC (FNPSC) staff in the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance/Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI).  While 95% of support is for program funded PSCs who implement OTIs programs, up to 5% may also include DCHA/OTI Direct Hire staff.

This position will be based in Washington and report to the Chief of DCHA/OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The incumbent must provide a high level of customer service, and is expected to exercise considerable independent judgment in planning, overseeing and reviewing PSC human resources functional areas of DCHA/OTI.   The Human Resources Specialist will serve as OTIs functional expert on USPSC and FNPSC human resources management, providing advice, interpretation and timely service to all levels of DCHA/OTI, helping to ensure that staff morale is maintained and that staff and implementing partners are trained in OTI program implementation/operations.

The successful applicant must demonstrate an aptitude for a broad range of human resources activities including training support, a strong interest in international development, excellent interpersonal skills, and the potential to assume progressively greater responsibility.  He or she must have a strong customer service ethic, and should be a good communicator responsive, approachable, open-minded, a good listener, and a team player who fosters a team environment and encourages staff to share ideas, information and feedback.  He or she must be willing to take on a variety of tasks, large and small, to ensure overall program success.

For full-time PSC employees supervised, the incumbent will prepare annual work plans and annual performance evaluations, and provide mentoring and training in the areas related to general human resources, general administrative support, and personnel management; 

* Provide oversight of OTIs operations and program implementation orientation and training activities; ensure that staff are aware of office, bureau, and agency training requirements as well as options, and maintain a DCHA/OTI staff training database;

* Develop and maintain a human resources system for program-funded staff that meets senior management information needs;

* Establish and maintain good working relationships with other USAID offices and bureaus in relation to human resources and PSC issues;

* When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTIs program goals;

* Draft and/or review personal service contract scopes of work;

* Coordinate preparation, review, and submission of personnel approval memos for program funded staff;

* Ensure completion of budgeting and contracting action needs within the human resources team;

* When required by the Chief of the Operations and Management Division, provide administrative program implementation support to field offices by assisting OTIs USPSC Senior Management Advisors in training for FNPSC staff, inputting FNPSC scopes of work into the Agency required format (CAJE), working with OTI staff on field training programs which involve OTI and implementing partner staff, and performing other field support tasks.  The incumbent will perform other duties and activities as required to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI programs, such as administrative, travel, information and technology, records management, other personnel and contractual support;

* Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of OTI country programs.

GS-13 duties and responsibilities:

Include all of the above duties, as well as:  

* Identify legal requirements and government reporting regulations affecting USPSC and FNPSC human resources functions and ensure that OTI policies, procedures and reporting are in compliance;

* Perform complex HR-related projects as assigned by the supervisor;

* When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, such as serving in the capacity of acting Division Chief, for example.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Human Resources Specialist will take direction from and will report to the Chief - OTI Operations and Management Division or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 003 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LIQUID OXYGEN TO STENNIS SPACE CENTER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that have been raised in response to the solicitation.  No further written inquiries will be accepted once this amendment is posted. QUESTION 1: C5.3 Unforecasted Destinations - Do you anticipate many within the 12 month period of this contract?  RESPONSE: The Government does not anticipate an unforecasted destination.  The purpose of this clause is to support the Government in situations where an installation in close proximity requires small amounts of liquid oxygen or nitrogen.  These cases are very rare, and occur on a one-time or limited basis.  QUESTION 2: C6.2 FAR 52.247-66 Returnable Cylinders (May 1994) - Do you anticipate cylinders to be used and or left at your facility?  It is our anticipation to deliver from our tankers then leave immediately without leaving equipment at your site. RESPONSE: This clause has been removed.  See Amendment 002. QUESTION 3: C6.5 1852.223-70 Safety & Health [paragraph] (d) and (e) - Does this article apply to activity at the Government site activity only?  RESPONSE: The key concept of NFS 1852.223-70 Safety and Health is embodied in the words that may be of immediate interest to NASA, arising out of work performed under this contract, listed in paragraph (d) of the clause. The requirements of paragraph (d) and (e) of NFS 1852.223-70 are applicable to the Government site as well as any other site where work under this contract is performed, where an incident or accident may be of the immediate interest to NASA [e.g., accident at the delivery point, injury to Government personnel (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts) during a quality audit at the contractors facility, etc.]. An incident or accident at the contractors facility DOES NOT necessarily constitute an occurrence that warrants notification to the Government.  However, in accordance with C5.1-Flash Reports, the contractor shall provide notification of any accident or incident which may have an adverse impact on the contractors ability to deliver requirements to the Government. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.
