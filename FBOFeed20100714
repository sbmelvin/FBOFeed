(approx. 7150 SF) and sheathing.  The building is 5 years old and exhibiting moisture related failures of the roof system.

Work includes furring up the roof, re-sheathing with plywood, enhancing ventilation; re-flashing roof, installing baffled ridge vents, replacing fascia, reroofing with standing seam metal roof and humidistat controlled fans in gable end walls. There also will be a bid alternate for reroofing with composition roofing. Contract performance time is 60 days.  Work will need to be done in phases so building is not exposed to the elements.  The job site is located on the Republic Ranger District compound in Republic, Washington, Ferry County.  Solicitations will be available on or about May 14, 2010.  Engineering point of contact is Lou Janke, Facilities Engineer, Colville National Forest, telephone:  (509) 684-7230.  A site visit is tentatively set for April 6, 2010 at 10 am meeting at the Gillette Campground.   Estimated project value $25,000 to $100,000 NAICS 238160 with size $14.0 mil.

<CONTACT>Mona M. Ash, Contract Specialist, Phone 206-526-6384, Fax 206-527-6025, Email mona.m.ash@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has a requirement to conduct two research cruises for Pacific Cod using a single chartered fishing vessel in September 2010 and February 2011 to tag and release cod and to collect catch data and biological data on cod and incidental species in the eastern Bering Sea. In lieu of compensation, the Pacific cod catch shall be retained by the charter vessel.
<p>The purpose of the first cruise is to tag and release Pacific cod. This cruise will be called the "Release Cruise". The Release Cruise will occur at approximately the same time as the 2010 B-Season for Pacific cod longline fishing in the Bering Sea. The cruise will begin on or about September 1, 2010. The cruise will start and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The cruise will consist of five (5) or fewer days in port at the beginning to mobilize the scientific operations aboard the vessel, thirty-five to forty-five (35 to 45) fishing days in the eastern Bering Sea, as necessary to meet sample size requirements, one (1) port day (to be scheduled during the fishing period), and three (3) or fewer days in port at the end to demobilize the vessel. The cruise will be broken into two legs, with a port day to occur on or about October 15, 2010 for purposes of exchanging scientific personnel and off-loading the catch (if necessary). The port of exchange will be on St. Paul Island in the Priblof Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of the second cruise is to provide fisheries independent data on tag recovery rates. This cruise will be called the "Recovery Cruise". The Recovery Cruise will begin on or about February 15, 2011. The Recovery Cruise will start and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The cruise will consist of five (5) or fewer days in port at the beginning to mobilize the vessel, forty to fifty (40 - 50) fishing days in the eastern Bering Sea, as necessary to meet sample size requirements, one (1) port day (to be scheduled during the fishing period), and three (3) or fewer days in port at the end to demobilize the vessel. The cruise will be broken into two legs, with a port day to occur on or about April 15, 2011 for purposes of exchanging scientific personnel and off-loading the catch (if necessary). The port of exchange will be on St. Paul Island in the Priblof Islands.</p>
<p>Note that the mobilization and demobilization periods stated above are maximum time periods. Mobilization and demobilization can be accomplished in less time.</p>
<p>In both cruises, fishing will occur every day unless it is a scheduled port day or fishing is cancelled due to weather conditions. Each fishing day the vessel shall set as much of its own longline gear as possible, given time and research fishing constraints. The vessel crew shall determine the attributes of an ideal unit of fishing gear, that is called the "standard gear" or the "standard gear unit". The scientific party will monitor all the units of gear for consistency and adherence to standards, ensuring that each unit of gear is as consistent as possible for research needs.</p>
<p>In both cruises, there will be two modes of research fishing. In both modes, Pacific cod are to be tagged and released with the greatest possible efficiency. However, in the first mode, the catches at each of thirty (30) stations will be used to estimate the geographic distribution cod. Consequently, the locations of the survey stations must be randomly selected and the vessel's fishing gear and fishing protocols must adhere closely to standards. The contractor shall determine the best fishing protocols, contingent upon approval by the Field Party Chief. Catch rate estimation and comparison will be only among strata and stations within a cruise. This mode of research fishing shall be called "Survey Fishing" or "Survey Mode".</p>
<p>The second mode of research fishing is for maximizing the number of tagged cod that are released as well as assuring that tagged fish are released near high concentrations of Pacific cod. In this mode, station location will be determined by the skipper of the vessel, in consultation with the Field Party Chief.</p>
<p>Total catch expectations are based on the number of cod that must be tagged and released (in the Release Cruise) and the number of cod that must be examined for tags independently of commercial fisheries (in the Recovery Cruise). In the Release Cruise we calculate that we must catch 500 metric tons (round weight) to achieve a more optimal number of tagged and released cod. In the Recovery Cruise we calculate that we must catch 1000 metric tons (round weight) to achieve a more optimal number of cod to be examined for tags.</p>
<p>VESSEL REQUIREMENTS for longline operations:</p>
<p>1. Minimum registered length 41.1 m (135 ft), although the preferred vessel registered length is 45.7 m (150 ft) or greater.</p>
<p>2. Minimum main engine continuous horsepower sufficient to permit a cruising speed of 18.5 km/hr (10 kts) in a moderate sea state.</p>
<p>3. Able to accommodate a field party of 8, including 4 contract scientists provided by the vessel.</p>
<p>4. The vessel must have an endurance capability for operating and fishing for a minimum of 45 consecutive days including running to and from stations.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall furnish cod longline gear that is completely rigged and ready to fish. Gear to be provided by the vessel shall include, but not be limited to the following: tackle and machinery necessary for setting and retrieving all components of the longline fishing system, flag-and-buoy arrays, buoy line, anchors, running line, and ground line with baited hooks. An auto baiting system is preferred. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. Hook size, hook spacing, and all other attributes of the tackle shall be determined by the contractor. Each unit of gear (e.g. magazine, rack, skate, etc) shall have the same ground line material and length, the same tackle fixing hooks to ground line, the same hook size, the same hook spacing, and the same number of hooks. Units of gear that vary by more than two percent (2%) from the number of hooks specified by the contractor shall not be deployed.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall furnish bait for each cruise. Each hook shall be baited with chopped squid in an amount per hook that is appropriate to the auto-baiting machinery. The bait shall be East Coast or North Atlantic squid (Illex illecebrosus), 2-3 count per lb or larger; Loligo or market squid is not acceptable. The general commercial designation is brown color, fit for human consumption (used as an index of freshness), and 100-200 grams per squid. The head and legs will not be used for bait, only the mantle and viscera. The mantle length should be 15-23 cm (6-9 in) long. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. At the beginning of each cruise, the vessel shall be supplied with a single lot of bait sufficient to last the duration of that cruise. Changes in bait characteristics during the course of the cruise will render catch rates incomparable from station to station. Calculation of the required amount of bait depends on the baiting characteristics of the vessel's fishing gear and the expected amount of fishing in a research cruise (see note below on the expected amount of fishing).</p>
<p>7. The vessel shall provide freezer storage, exclusive of that for ship stores, sufficient to store at least 272 mt (600,000 lb) of dressed and frozen fish. If more cod are caught than can be carried in the vessel's freezer storage then a mid-cruise off-load can be negotiated between the Government and the contractor.</p>
<p>8. Contract Scientific Personnel <br />a. The Contractor shall provide at least four (4) trained biologists to conduct standard survey data collection operations that shall perform 1) catch tallying of individual hooks; 2) length and sex sampling of catch; 3) recording and editing data in appropriate forms and computer files.<br />b. Personnel must receive training in the above operations by Government survey scientists prior to participation in the survey. <br />c. Personnel shall be employed by a qualified scientific firm or institute engaged in marine fisheries research, or in providing scientific personnel.</p>
<p>9. The vessel and officer licensing requirements shall be sufficient to permit the chartered vessel to carry eight (8) personnel in the field party (both male and female).</p>
<p>EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FISHING</p>
<p>Total catch requirements have been determined based on the optimal numbers of cod required for mark-recapture estimation (given practical constraints such as vessel time, numbers of research scientists required, and windows of opportunity based on seasonality and fishing periods). For the Release Cruise, a minimum of 500 metric tons (round weight) of Pacific cod must be caught. For the Recovery Cruise, a minimum of 1000 metric tons (round weight) of Pacific cod must be caught. Because catch rates are uncertain under research fishing protocols, the number of days required to achieve these catches cannot be guaranteed. We calculate that the Release Cruise will require between 35 and 45 days of actual fishing, excluding days lost to poor weather or mechanical breakdown and excluding days required for mobilization and demobilization. We calculate that the Recovery Cruise (the winter cruise) will require between 40 and 50 days of actual fishing, excluding days lost to poor weather or mechanical breakdown and excluding days required for mobilization and demobilization. We have tried to make these conservative estimates and it may be that fewer fishing days will be required to achieve the catch goals.</p>
<p>In each cruise there will be two research modes, Survey Mode and Tagging Mode. If the catch goals for each stratum have not been met while fishing in Survey Mode, then the vessel will switch to Tagging Mode to assure a more optimal number of cod are tagged (in the Release Cruise) or examined for tags (in the Recovery Cruise).</p>
<p>During the Survey Mode, the vessel must visit each of 30 stations randomly selected across the eastern Bering Sea. One day of fishing will be done at each of the thirty survey stations. If foul weather prevents fishing at a particular survey station then fishing operations shall cease until conditions permit their resumption and that station can be sampled. Each survey station will be fished on a 24 hour cycle, including running time from the previous station, which may be as much as 10 hours for the 10 stations in the strata with lower sampling density. Based on these constraints the offeror can expect the chartered vessel to be able to run about half the gear that would be deployed during open access fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 40,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 20,000 hooks per day during the research fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 70,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 35,000 hooks per day during the Survey Mode. These are conservative estimates and a larger number of hooks may be fished per day in strata with higher station density, though this is not certain.</p>
<p>If the catch goal of a stratum has not been met or exceeded by catches made at the survey stations visited in Survey Mode, the vessel shall switch to Tagging Mode and fish until the sampling requirement has been met. In Tagging Mode, the stations shall be selected by the captain, in consultation with the Field Party Chief, the goal being to find the highest concentrations of cod in the research stratum. The vessel may remain at a Tagging Station for up to three days before moving to another. If the vessel needs to move to another Tagging Station, it too shall be selected by the vessel captain, in consultation with the Field Party Chief. There are three restrictions of the captain's choice of Tagging Stations: all Tagging Stations must be separated from other stations by at least 40 nautical miles, none of the Survey Stations may be repeated as Tagging Stations, and Tagging Stations must be at a distance of 15 nautical miles or greater from strata boundaries.</p>
<p>It is possible that in each area, the vessel may switch between Survey Mode and Tagging Mode as best suits vessel efficiency. However, we anticipate that the Survey Stations will have all been visited prior to switching to Tagging Mode. This is because if catch rates are high in Survey Stations then we may reach or exceed our minimum sampling requirement for a particular stratum.</p>
<p>In anticipating the expected amount of fishing, the expected catch, and the expected bait requirements, the contractor should exercise due caution. In particular, the contractor should take care to avoid underestimating the bait requirement.</p>
<p>The number of cod removed from the research catch for scientific purposes is expected to be about 300 per day in both Survey and Tagging Modes. The remainder of the catch shall be turned over to the vessel.</p>
<p>Period of performance shall begin on or about September 10, 2010 for the first cruise. The second cruise shall begin on or about February 15, 2011. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 532411 with a size standard of $7M. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about July 29, 2010 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. The estimated response due date is August 30, 2010; however, the actual date offers are due will be stated within the solicitation documents.

SYNOPSIS
Background
The National Park Service is responsible for avoiding, to the extent possible, impacts associated with floodplain modification. The scope of this project includes the monitoring and analysis of the Toklat River floodplain upstream of, through, and downstream of the areas used for annual gravel extraction, near the Toklat Road Camp, as required by the Gravel Acquisition Plan Analysis EA Statement of Findings (2003).  Cross-sections that were first established for this purpose in the late 1980s and early 1990s will be re-established and resurveyed, using the same local benchmarks as the original surveys.  
Project Activities
1. 2010 Topographic SurveyThe vendor will conduct a topographic survey of the cross-sections used to monitor the Toklat gravel scrape area.  These cross-sections extend laterally from a line extending from the East Toklat bridge downstream to the left bankrock outcrop just downstream of the Toklat Road Camp.  Minimum spacing between the cross-sections will be 300 feet.  Surveys will extend from the right bank to the left bank, and all significant breaks of slope that occur across the channel will be surveyed.  Important features to be measured include all active channels, floodplains, and the first floodplain terrace on each bank.  Cross-sections will have a minimum of 40 points and a maximum of 100 points for each cross-section.  Surveys will be on the same locations and vertical datum as historic surveys.
2. 2011 Topographic surveyThe vendor will conduct a topographic survey of the cross-sections used to monitor the Toklat gravel scrape area.  These cross-sections extend laterally from a line extending from the East Toklat bridge downstream to the left bankrock outcrop just downstream of the Toklat Road Camp.  Minimum spacing between the cross-sections will be 300 feet.  Surveys will extend from the right bank to the left bank, and all significant breaks of slope that occur across the channel will be surveyed.  Important features to be measured include all active channels, floodplains, and the first floodplain terrace on each bank.  Cross-sections will have a minimum of 40 points and a maximum of 100 points for each cross-section.  Surveys will be on the same locations and vertical datum as historic surveys.
3. Technical Analysis of Historic and Current DataAn analysis of the effects of gravel mining will be completed using all available cross-section data, aerial photographs, and scrape documentation. Individual analysis of all three data sources should be followed by a comprehensive analysis of the effects of gravel mining and assessment of success in meeting the goals of the related environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact. 
The vendor will process any and all historic data from previous years of cross-section surveys.  Historic data will be included in a spreadsheet, and graphed.  Analysis of any trends and recommendations for future park actions will be made. Additionally, the results from Denali shall be put into context with the observed effects of other gravel extraction efforts through a literature review.
Deliverable Products 
1.	Interim analysis: analysis of 2010 cross-section survey and comparison to historic survey. 2.	Graphical cross-sections and all cross-section data in numerical form (EXCEL file) for all years of available and useable data.  3.	AutoCAD map of the Toklat River project area, showing the approximate location of the surveyed cross-sections, permanent elevation benchmarks, and temporary benchmarks, and appropriate local features.  4.	Technical analysis of data regarding the trend in river conditions and geomorphological changes, both long- and short-term, where apparent.5.	Analysis of available aerial photographs. 6.	Analysis of available gravel extraction data. 7.	Discussion of the effects of gravel mining on the river, including an evaluation of park gravel scraping allotments as defined in the Gravel Acquisition Plan Environmental Assessment and related observations on the park's execution of gravel scrapes.8.	Recommendations for future monitoring and analysis of the Toklat River near the Toklat Road Camp. To include evaluation of scrape limit, with recommended revised limit and justification. 9.	Literature review on effects of in-stream gravel mining that are relevant to the situation at the Toklat River.
A final report will be prepared by the vendor and will be delivered to the National Park Service no later than 45 days after the completion of the fieldwork.  This document will include project photographs, surveyed cross-sections, as-surveyed cross-section graphs, AutoCAD map, and a narrative describing the methods used to survey the cross-sections, and a monitoring plan for future monitoring efforts (2 hardcopies, an electronic version and CD in Work and PDF), and a powerpoint presentation summarizing the results. Electronic versions in original file formats, and a comprehensive Adobe Acrobat file will be submitted on compact disk.

<DESC>Building 600 was constructed in 1937 and is a block, brick and concrete structure that encompasses approximately 71,590 SF. It is currently used as Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ). The first floor porches and associated breezeways all have concrete floors and ceilings. The outer wall consists of decorative brick arches and wooden railings. The back/side walls consist of the outer brick walls of the building. The lighting consists of ceiling hung and surface mounted lantern style lights. The concrete porch ceilings have deteriorated due to water intrusion and age. There are small to large areas of spalling caused by a build up of pressure from the expansion of rusting rebar. Several areas of exposed # 5 rebar cages were observed and the extent of the length and depth of damage could not be ascertained without the removal of additional concrete. There are also several areas of damage to the masonry wall where the concrete ceiling is joined to the masonry wall. The South entrance exterior masonry walls have approximately 160 SF of missing or damaged mortar joints. The North entry/breezeway exterior masonry walls have approximately 270 SF of missing or damaged mortar joints. The Southeast, Northeast, Northwest and Southwest porch exterior masonry walls have approximately 110 SF of missing or damaged mortar joints on each. These voids on the exterior of the masonry walls are contributing to the water intrusion and furthering the damage to the concrete and masonry damage.

Statement of Work:
Statement of Work:  Evaluation of the Behavior and Control of Selenium (Se) in Coal-fired Boilers
Background
EPA'S Office of Air Quality Procedures and Standards (OAQPS - Office of Air & Radiation), is preparing to develop a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) - based rule to control hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric utility boilers.  This "Utility MACT" may include the use of "surrogate" measurements - i.e., inferred control of a HAP (or HAPs) based on the measurement or control of another pollutant or other component.  To support this effort, EPA's Office of Research & Development (ORD) is conducting tests, using a range of coal-types and process configurations, in the Multipollutant Control Research Facility (MPCRF).
The MPCRF is a pilot-scale combustion research facility located in the High Bay Building (HBB) at EPA's Research Triangle Park, NC campus.  The combustor is rated at 4 MMBtu/hr (approximately 1.2 MWt).  It is capable of firing all types of pulverized coal, natural gas and No. 2 fuel oil.  The combustor is equipped with low NOX burners and a SCR unit (with Cormetech catalyst) for NOX control.  The system has an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and a fabric filter (FF) - positioned in parallel - for Particular Matter (PM) control.  The flue gas can be directed to either the ESP or the FF.  The facility also uses a wet lime-based flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber for control of SO2 emissions.  The system is equipped with continuous emissions monitors (CEMs) for on-line measurement of O2, CO2, NOX (NO and NO2), SO2, CO and Hg.  There are multiple sampling ports through out the gas flow path.  The facility is designed for ease of modification so that various control technologies and configurations can be tested.  The facility has a series of heat exchangers to remove heat such that the flow path of the flue gas has a similar temperature profile to that seen in a full-scale power plant.
One of the goals of the MPCRF tests (referred to as the "Surrogacy Tests") is to collect data to judge the viability on the use of surrogates for many of the HAPs.  The control of the non-mercury metal HAPs (e.g., arsenic, selenium, cadmium, lead, etc.) will be compared against the control of the bulk particulate matter (PM) in the primary PM control device (either the ESP or the FF).  Helble (2000) previously surveyed emissions of trace elements from many power plants compiled by EPRI in the PISCES field-sampling program.  With the exception of As, Se, and Hg, the emission rates of other trace elements could be modeled adequately using the rate of emissions of particulate matter from the ESP, because these elements are mostly found in the collected fly ash (i.e., they are controlled consistently along with the bulk PM).  Mercury can be controlled using a variety of options (or combinations of technologies), such as activated carbon injection (ACI), halogen injection, wet scrubbing, etc.  Selenium, in particular, seems to vary considerably and be much less predictable than the other non-Hg metal HAPs.  The behavior of selenium in coal-fired power plants is relevant to air emissions of this hazardous air pollutant, as well as to emissions of selenium in wastewater discharges (ash ponds, scrubber water treatment).  There is a need for a fundamentally based, predictive model for vapor-solid partitioning of selenium in coal-fired boilers and in downstream air pollution control equipment, in order to predict selenium concentrations in fly ash and vapor-phase selenium entering FGD scrubbers. 

Objective  
The objective of the proposed work is to advance the knowledge of selenium behavior in coal-fired boilers and to assess the potential for controlling emissions of selenium. In this project, pilot-scale data will be used to improve an existing model for selenium. The model will be used to carry out scoping studies to advance understand the effects of changing conditions and coal composition on selenium partitioning in coal-fired boilers and the potential for using sorbents to control selenium air emissions.
Statement of Work / Tasks
Task 1. Literature Review.  The objective is to provide background on the relevant chemistry of selenium, under the conditions of a coal-fired boiler. A better understanding of the speciation of selenium in the gas and solid phases in combustion systems will help to improve the model to predict selenium partitioning in coal-fired boilers. The contractor shall  provide a survey of the available literature on (a) gas-phase behavior of selenium in high temperature systems, (b) chemical reactions between selenium and common constituents in flue gas and ash, including unburned carbon and activated carbon, (c) full-scale data on selenium partitioning in coal-fired boilers, and (d) leaching of selenium from coal fly ash.  
Task 2. Modeling of Pilot-Scale Data.  The objective of this task is to use pilot-scale data generated in EPA's 4 MMBtu/hr (1.2 MWt) pulverized coal furnace, located in Research Triangle Park, as input for existing model(s) for metals partitioning in coal-fired boilers.  As part of surrogate evaluations for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), EPA ORD (with EPA OAR and EPA OAQPS) is conducting pilot-scale tests focused on HAPs, including selenium. Data from these tests will be provided to the contractor.  The contractor will analyze the data and use the data as input to existing  models of metals behavior in the pilot-scale combustor to create a Se-specific model (or, perhaps, to enhance an existing Se-specific model). The results from this effort will lead to improvements in the predictive capability of the selenium model.
Task 3. Model Scoping Studies.  The objective of this task is to use the model to better understand the effects of changing conditions and coal composition on selenium partitioning in coal-fired boilers in which a variety of coal types and temperature profiles can be found. Selenium partitioning (from coal to ESP outlet) will be predicted for coals of different compositions (ranks) and different air pollution control devices. In addition, calculations will be carried out to simulate the injection of calcium- and iron-containing sorbents at various locations in the boiler. The results of this task will be useful for better planning of measurement campaigns and evaluation of sorbents for removal of selenium.
Quality Assurance
The contractor shall prepare a quality assurance project plan for research model development and application projects in accordance with Attachment #1.  It shall be submitted to the EPA project manager and the EPA QA staff for review and approval.  Work involving the collection or use of environmental data shall not commence until the QAPP has received official approval from the EPA QA staff.
Deliverables and Schedule
The quality assurance project plan shall be delivered to EPA within 4 weeks of the award of this contract.  The contractor shall prepare brief monthly reports documenting the progress during the project. The contractor shall provide a final report, documenting the results of Tasks 1 through 3, plus recommendations for future work, shall be prepared. The final report shall be the final deliverable on this project.  The final report shall be provided to the EPA Project Officer within 9 months after award.
The Final Report Shall Contain:"	A thorough literature review and background on the Chemistry of Selenium under high temperature combustion conditions. "	A description of the Model for Tasks 2 and 3 from the aforementioned Statement of Work."	A description of the pilot-scale date used for the modeling work. "	A description and discussion of the modeling results. 
The contractor shall comply with all requirements as delineated on the "Quality Assurance Planning Requirements Form" included with the intramural action.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR SSC Pacific) intends to negotiate acommercial, sole-source, contract IAW FAR Part 13.5 for the development,production, and limited testing of a prototype circuit breaker/crowbar toDiversified Technologies, Bedford, MA 01730.
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements
The device is a solid-state combination circuit breaker/crowbar designed foroperation in the Fixed Submarine Broadcast System (FSBS) Very Low Frequency(VLF) and Low Frequency (LF) tube-type transmitters. SPAWAR SSC Pacific Code55320 supports the FSBS Transmitter VLF/LF In Service Engineering Agency(ISEA) at SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic, Code 5.5.3.5 that is responsible fordesign changes to the FSBS transmitters. In the tube-type transmitters thereexists a protective device for the delicate and expensive tubes called acrowbar.When this crowbar circuit operates it places large electromagnetic stresses onthe power system supplying the transmitter and also produces a significantdrop in voltage during its operation. These factors have impeded past effortsto connect FSBS transmitter sites to the commercial power grid due to thenegative impact this circuit will have on the customers connected to thegrid.The advent of high power electronics has made it possible to dissipate thelarge amount of energy stored in the transmitter tube circuits. Additionally,it ispossible with these same high power electronics to supply the necessary powerto the transmitter tube circuits. Combining these two functions into one deviceallows a combination device of a crowbar and circuit breaker to be devised.
A full literature and industry research was done to find sources that providecomponents such as those needed for this project.  In the United States, onlyDiversified Technologies manufactures components capable of withstanding thevoltages and currents used in the FSBS VLF/LF Transmitters. Specifically, thisprototype requires a circuit breaker/crowbar capable of switching between 15kVand 400amps.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirementor submit proposals. Information received will normally be considered solelyforthe purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Adetermination by the Government to compete the proposed contract basedupon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of theGovernment.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is335999, and the size standard is 500 employees. The estimated value of theeffort is $150,000 (FFP).
Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed toSpencer Sessions at spencer.sessions@navy.mil. Questions and/or responsesare due by COB 28 July 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: Adam Butryn, 732-427-1008<BR><BR>Repair and Maintenance of AN/PVS-10(V)1, 5855-01-410-8979, Sight, Night Vision, Sniper Scope (SNS) and AN/PVS-10(V)2, 5855-01-499-1239 Sight, Night Vision, Sniper Scope.<BR><BR><BR>     This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN/PVS-10(V)<BR>Family of integrated day and night scopes.  The AN/PVS-10 SNS system is an integrated day and night <BR>weapon sight providing both day and night firing capabilities in a single sight.  The SNS is used on<BR>the M24 rifle for the Army and the M40A3 rifle with the Marine Corps.  Typically, night sights are only <BR>used for operations at night and as such have only a night channel.  Operation in the daytime would <BR>require removal of the night sight and installation of a day scope.  This would require alignment each <BR>time a sight is removed and re-installed.  Alignment is critical to sniper weapon accuracy for both day<BR>and night operations.  The SNS is an integrated day and night sight and thus eliminates the need for<BR>changing sights between day and night operations.  <BR><BR>      The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/PVS-10(V) family of integrated day/night scopes.  The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a five-year period. Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the AN/PVS-10(V) system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit, and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days.  This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the repair cycle time.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.  <BR><BR><BR>Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 13 August 2010, to CECOM LCMC,  ATTN: RDER-PRA-CA (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

<DESC>The United States Military Academy is looking for vendors that have the capability to build, demonstrate, and deliver one prototype brushless motor tendon-muscle control system with two tuned brushless motor muscle/tendon actuators.  The bi-directional plantar flexion/extension control system must be capable of achieving a dorsi/plantar flexion sweep between 30 dorsi flexion and 37 plantar flexion (45/55mm actuator extension/contraction) within 30% of a single gait cycle executed at 100 steps per minute.  The control system must include a user interface that allows the amputee/operator to switch between a walk and run gait cycle.  The input may be semi-automatic or manual, but must allow the amputee to properly transition between a walk and run gait with less than one second delay.   The control system sensor array must be compatible with the existing control system developed by the USMA cadet design team, which relies solely on two analog sensor signals to properly determine the relative orientation of the foot with respect to the tibia, and the absolute orientation of the foot with respect to the ground reference frame, within 3% error, throughout the gait cycle.   Multiplexing signals is not a viable option as it will not support the USMA cadet capstone scope of work.  The control processor algorithms must be developed using MATLAB Simulink RTW to allow modification and testing by the USMA cadet capstone design team.  All developed supporting libraries and control blocksets must be delivered with the control system for use/modification by the USMA cadet design team.  The contract awardee must also collaborate directly with the USMA cadet design team to develop the integrated control box and harness/carrier; must approve the mounting, clearance, ventilation of the assembly prior to manufacture; and must assemble the control box upon receipt of the manufactured box/harness/carrier assembly.  The dimensional constraints of the control system are 75 cubic inches with a weight no greater than 7 lbs with battery system.  The contract awardee must redesign the motor control system to accommodate the Neumotor 1708-1Y brushless motor and integrated Rollvis satellite roller screw assembly.  The actuator assembly must accomplish the control objectives using a 90mm lever arm, .3mm pitch three-start (1mm effective pitch) thread roller screw assembly and 100 N/m tendon springs.   The contract awardee must deliver the control system within five months of the date of the contract.  Any source that can perform the above requirement must have validated their capabilities at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (system/subsystem prototype demonstration in a relevant environment) to facilitate the West Point Bionic Foot team design objective of performing TRL 6 walk over ground tests 1 February 2010 to 27 April 2010.  Any vendors that feel they have the capability and capacity to perform the above shall send their Company Name, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, e-mail address, as well as their capabilities to perform the above, to Pam.Jones1@us.army.mil within 5 business days of this notice.  This notice is not a solicitation of offers - it is a sources sought notice for informational purposes only.

Statement of Work

Background

QPix2 and QBot are a high-throughput robot handling system that is capable of many applications that includes high-speed colony picking, macroarraying (gridding), replicating, and re-arraying. The QPix2 is a versatile, automated colony picker in a space-saving bench-top format. Colonies are imaged by an on-board CCD camera and picked at a rate of up to 4,600 colonies per hour.  The fully enclosed system with UV sterilization ensures an ultra-clean environment, while the high-pressure wash station eliminates carry-over.  The intuitive software allows maximum flexibility over colony selection criteria, gridding patterns and library management. The QBot has extensive plate-stacking capacity which allows high-throughput operation, while automated plate-handling and lid-removal enable long unattended runs. The intuitive software allows maximum flexibility over colony selection criteria, gridding patterns and library management.

Purpose

The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />In 1991 the National Library of Medicine's Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division commenced a one-year pilot initiative referred to as TIOP (the Toxicology Information Outreach Project). Its modest but important mission was to strengthen the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to train health professionals to use NLM's Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program databases. Representatives of eight HBCUs attended the first TIOP meeting, held at NLM in August of that year. <br /><br />In the nineteen years since its inception, the project has strengthened the link between NLM and HBCUs to a point where by the year 2000 nearly 80 minority institutions have received training under the TIOP program. The initiative has also grown in breadth and scope as well as in size. In addition to its initial focus on toxicology and environmental health, other health disparities have been added representing a broader perspective of minority health. <br />Nine institutions were initially selected to participate in what was characterized at the time as a "pilot" Toxicology Information Outreach Project. These institutions were:<br /><br />&bull; Charles R. Drew University<br />&bull; Florida A&amp;M University <br />&bull; Howard University <br />&bull; Meharry Medical College<br />&bull; Morehouse School of Medicine<br />&bull; Texas Southern University<br />&bull; Tuskegee University <br />&bull; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff<br />&bull; Xavier University <br />
<p><br />Though considered extremely successful by NLM, TIOP members and beneficiaries, by 2002 the program had reached a point in its growth where new definition for future growth was being called for. In an assessment of the program in 2001 all panel members were of the opinion that they could "better respond to NLM's desire for increased awareness and increased use of NLM resources -- while at the same time better serving their own institutional missions -- if the TIOP program were strengthened and broadened in scope." At that time TIOP was renamed the Environmental Health Information Outreach Program and the scope modified to include health disparities and community health information outreach. The participation was also expanded to include additional minority serving institutions.<br /><br />Objectives<br /><br />More recently, the program was renamed as the Environmental Health Information Partnership (EnHIP) with twenty-one participating minority serving institutions. The group has developed a new strategic plan in alignment with NLM's Long Range Plan, Charting the Course for the 21st Century. The focus remains on building the capacity of these institutions to use health information and information technology and incorporate this into their curricula. However, it now also includes promoting and supporting research, community outreach, and increasing the number of minorities in biomedicine and biomedical informatics.<br /><br />Project Requirements <br /><br />The EnHIP Senior Science Advisor will:<br /><br />1) Provide guidance to NLM in the development of EnHIP projects and plans;<br />2) Attend EnHIP Executive Committee meetings and program meetings<br />3) Meet, as needed, with the EnHIP Executive Secretary and NLM staff<br />4) Coordinate up to two seminars focused on state-of-the art developments associated with minority health (e.g., gene-environment interaction)<br />5) Represent NLM, as requested, at minority health-related conferences and meetings.<br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br /><br />It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be September 15, 2010-September 14, 2011 plus the possibility of two option years.<br />&nbsp;<br />Other Important Considerations<br /><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br /><br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ is seeking information from potential sources for an airborne video recording system capable of satisfying the functions outlined below.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The proliferation of airborne EO/IR HD sensors has driven a need for increased speed and capacity in airborne video encoder/recorder/exploitation systems. Not only is high fidelity recording of all imaging channels desired, but associated NGA compliant metadata must also be recorded along with the imagery in such a fashion to allow later exploitation and easy retrieval and review during mission.</p>
<p>Desired capability/functionality:<br />The recording system will consist of three components: H.264 encoder, recorder, and exploitation software. The encoder should be capable of handling both NTSC and SMPTE 292M video streams and converting them to H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10 over MPEG 2-TS) video. In addition, NGA compliant metadata embedded in the SMPTE stream should be passed unaltered on a frame by frame basis. The goal is to encode the video with near lossless compression with a minimum of 20 Mbps throughput. There is a desire to have an encoder capable of outputting a single user selectable H.264 video stream to a downlink simultaneously at a lower fixed bit rate. Encoders tailored to handle airborne imagery with noisy and rapidly changing scenery with minimum artifacts are preferred. The recorder should input H.264 video and record to hard or solid state drives. The goal is to record 4 channels of H.264 streams in parallel for up to 8 hours with minimal maintenance (i.e. changing out hard drives). The video should be recorded in 1 minute clips with the associated unaltered metadata. Solutions using COTS hardware in 19" rack mounted format are desired for both encoder and recorder. In addition, search software is required to search the recorded video database by any metadata tag in near real time. Any additional exploitation capabilities, such as the ability to tag or annotate and disseminate clips or snapshots, are preferred.</p>
<p>Vendors providing all or part of the full solution are encouraged to reply.</p>
<p>All interested parties may provide catalogs, drawings/illustrations, technical manuals, training description/material, warranty, testing documentation, brochures and/or any other documentation that describes the capability to design, develop, manufacture and support an effort of the type described herein.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market interest, feasibility, and capability of sources and does not constitute a request for proposal. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the government. No reimbursement will be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunties (fedbizopps) announcement.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Each response must reference the "sources sought" title and reference N68335-10-RFI-0284. Responses should be sent to Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, Attn: Terrence Shearer, Code 25232, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. Mr. Terrence Shearer is the point of contact for this "sources sought" notice and can be reached at telephone (732) 323-2788 and e-mail address: terrence.shearer@navy.mil.

<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Historical Services<br />Currently, DOD OIG utilizes the Defense Audit Management Information System (DAMIS). DAMIS is a planning and tracking system that was originally designed to provide an automated tool for capturing and distributing audit project information. DAMIS subsequently became the automated tool used to record time and attendance and training information in other DOD OIG components. It has been determined that DAMIS has reached the end of its life cycle and no longer satisfies the needs of the DOD OIG Audit components. A new information management system is necessary to accommodate the current and future needs of DOD OIG to track and monitor audit project status, provide data for Congressional and other reporting, and track and forecast project costs and expenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE<br />The purpose of this request for information is to provide the DOD OIG with an automated information system to facilitate planning, managing and supporting its users throughout both the United States and world-wide. Users include executives, managers, project leaders, auditors, management analysts, management support personnel, evaluators, investigators, inspectors, and technical support personnel. The system should be able to provide tracking and reporting for audit activities, personnel assignments and timekeeping, and personnel training. The system will be used for day-to-day tracking of audit activities and personnel, and for producing reports that provide timely and accurate information about audit activities and personnel and the associated costs. The goal for this system is to provide personnel with a day-to-day means of recording their activities and accomplishments, and to provide management with a timely and precise view of this activity. The system should be able to accommodate the current and future needs of the DOD OIG to track and monitor audit project status; provide data for the Secretary of Defense, Congressional, and other reporting; and track and forecast project costs and expenses including training and travel. It is anticipated that contractor support will be used throughout the period of performance identified in the contract.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />The automated information system will be used to plan, track, monitor and report on DOD OIG work products and personnel assignments, training, and certifications and memberships. Work products include audits, assessments, evaluations, and inspections, but are not limited to these types of reports. Personnel assignments are associated with the work products, although individuals can be simultaneously associated with more than one work product. The DOD OIG has offices throughout the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) that obtain services and support from a primary site over an Intranet. Personnel must be able to track time spent on each project; account for training requests for both mandatory and non-mandatory training; and account for external professional certifications, internal certifications, and memberships they hold in professional organizations. Management personnel must be able to track availability of personnel by components and divisions. DOD OIG also serves as a focal point for audit-related reporting from other DOD agencies to other branches of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The operational concept is to have a beginning-to-end project management system for the DOD OIG that provides corporate management of projects and costs, mid-level management support of audit programs, and audit staff in their day-to-day responsibilities. The project management system must provide:</p>
<p>1) A "dashboard" that provides rolled-up data for the elements below.<br />2) Requesting and tracking of training using OPM Form SF182.<br />3) Project Management capability to:<br />a. Allows employees and mid-level supervisors to track audits, assessments, evaluations, inspections, and other work products.<br />b. Tracks and reports the number of work hours and employee resources assigned; calculates project costs based on employee hourly pay rates,; and calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) for DOD-OIG audits, assessments, evaluations, inspections, and other work products.<br />c. Tracks and reports the travel costs associated with both projects as well as training. System should interface with the Defense Travel System, used by the DOD-OIG to track travel costs.<br />4) A time and attendance system, that pulls data from an external database. <br />Additionally, the system should provide the following services:</p>
<p>1. Track, manage, and monitor the creation of reports to justify the performance of audit or audit-related projects and the development of the ODIG-AUD Annual Audit Plan.<br />2. Plan, track and report on personnel assignments, project status, and costs for DOD OIG projects including audits, assessments, evaluations and inspections of DOD programs and operations.<br />3. Track, monitor, and report on staff resource availability, travel dollars, calendar days, and work hours expended during the performance of audits, assessments, evaluations, and inspections of DOD programs and operations.<br />4. Track, manage, monitor, and report on personnel at the DOD OIG Component level.<br />5. Record, track, and report on time spent by DOD OIG personnel on DOD OIG projects and non-project related activities. <br />6. Track, monitor and report on actual project performance against approved milestones and budgets. <br />7. Provide an ad hoc capability for reports on planned, ongoing, and completed projects. <br />8. Perform trend analysis on projects issued, estimated and actual monetary benefits gained or recovered through completed DOD OIG work projects coverage of key strategic areas, and critical DOD issues from past audits across all of DOD. <br />9. Track and report on the status of findings, recommendations, and potential monetary benefits associated with DOD OIG audits, assessments, evaluations, and inspections; and GAO audits on DOD activities.<br />10. Track and report on DOD OIG management action items taken to resolve identified risks and weaknesses identified during audits, assessments, evaluations, and inspections of DOD programs and operations.<br />11. Monitor and report on the execution of the training and travel budgets. <br />12. Provide a means to plan, schedule, monitor, and report on personnel training requests and completion of the requests both individually and as an organization.<br />13. Track, monitor, and report on compliance with mandatory, Federal, and DOD OIG-initiated education requirements.<br />14. Facilitate the coordination and exchange of information among the Defense oversight organizations and their respective customers about planned, ongoing, and completed audits, evaluations, and inspections of DOD programs and operations to minimize duplication of efforts.<br />15. Facilitate the collection of data from the Defense oversight organizations about their activities completed during the 6-month reporting periods ending March 31 and September 30 for Semi-Annual Reporting to Congress as required by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.</p>
<p><br />Technical Requirements</p>
<p>The system must meet the following minimum technical requirements:</p>
<p>1. Prefer existing Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software, with an established product lifecycle of at least 5 years, and future versions available to ensure longevity of the system.<br />2. Provide a web-based interface and capability to integrate with Microsoft Office SharePoint. NOTE: Is this a MINIMUM requirement?<br />3. Web-based interface must be Common Access Card (CAC) enabled for user authentication.<br />4. The system must be Section 508 compliant, as well as meet all DoD Information Assurance (IA) and Information Security requirements.<br />5. The system must be able to operate efficiently over low-bandwidth connections. The typical connection currently provided to DoD OIG field offices is a T1 (1.544Mbps) connection, with some offices connecting over satellite links. NOTE: Is this expected to remain the same, or would we upgrade if something better is available?<br />6. The system must be capable of importing and exporting data to Oracle and SQL databases and in XML format.<br />7. The system must use DoD approved PKI certificates to authenticate users. <br />8. The system must be able to protect stored sensitive information using NIST-approved cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />SECURITY CLEARANCE: This effort involves the contractor having access to FOUO, Confidential and classified information/material. The contractor shall provide personnel with clearances up to the "TOP SECRET" level for some tasks which are identified and SECRET for all others.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: Responses to this RFI are to be submitted via email to willie.spivey@dodig.mil: no later than 23 July 2010, 3:00 pm, Central Time.</p>
<p>Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All government and contractor personal reviewing RFI responses will have signed non-disclosure agreements and understand their responsibility for proper use and protection from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described 41 USC 423.

Sources Sought Synopsis Diagnosing and Monitoring Alzheimer Disease (AD) in vivo using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy

Contracting Office Address:
VAMC Providence, Mailstop 650/90C, 623 Atwells Avenue, Providence, RI 02909-2472

 This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: the availability and present capability of qualified sources to fulfill the Government requirement.   Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. 
Background

The molecular bases of Alzheimer disease and related neuordegenerative disorders are becoming better understood, but the means for definitive diagnosis and monitoring in vivo remain lacking.  Near-infrared optical spectroscopy (NIR) offers a potential solution.   Transmission and reflectance spectra of thin brain tissue slabs have been used to calculate wavelength-dependent absorption and reduced scattering coefficients from 470-1000 nm.  The reduced scattering coefficients in the near-infrared clearly differentiated Alzheimer Disease from control specimens.  Diffuse reflectance spectra of gross brain tissue in vitro have confirmed this observation.  These results suggest a means for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer disease in vivo using near-infrared optical spectroscopy.

Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, terminal, neurodegenerative disorder.  The largest risk factor for AD is advanced age, and the public health impact of AD and related disorders is increasing in proportion to the senior population served by US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).    

Purpose and Objectives 
The VA seeks solutions for the early diagnosis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders by using non-invasive NIR in vivo to characterize the light-scattering signatures of dense protein aggregates.
Interested contractors should consult the following paper for additional purpose and objectives: Reference: E.B Hanlon, L. T. Perelman, E. I. Vitkin, F. A. Greco, A. C. McKee, N. W. Kowall, Optics Letters 33, 624 (March 15, 2008) (Scattering Differentiates Alzheimer disease in vitro).


The VA will assess the responses to this Sources Sought notice to determine the present existing ability and capacity in the contractor community to execute the tasks described in the requirements.

 Requirements
The contractor shall design, fabricate and test near-infrared (NIR) optical spectroscopy technology for the non-invasive detection, diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease and related neurodegenerative disorders (AD), including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to increase the original sole source contract (IAW FAR 6.302-1) with Prometheus Labs (Contract #N62645-09-D-5011) at 9410 Carroll Park Drive, San Diego, California 92121, as the only responsible source that can provide testing on patient specimens that are intended to diagnose and/or treat celiac diseases.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.
Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) has an increased need for a standard of care for testing by Prometheus which specializes in gastrointestinal disease serological and genetic testing using proprietary and patented markers with sophisticated pattern recognition technology to aid clinicians.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) has traditionally been a disease diagnosed (ruled in or out) by "process of elimination."  However, Prometheus has developed a blood-based biomarker test that can directly diagnose IBS; this is possible using the IBS Diagnostic Serology 7 test to differentiate the diagnosis of IBS from Celiac Disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-IBS.
There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 621511 with a Small Business Size Standard of $13.5.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Brian Miller at brian.miller4@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Brian Miller. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 28 July 2010. No phone calls accepted.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE FUNDED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA) PUBLIC LAW 111-5. <br /><br />This is a Special Notice for Information Purposes Only. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, in accordance with the guidance in FAR Subpart 13.501(a)(i) with Carl Zeiss Corporation of Peabody, MA for the purchase of a Helium Ion Microscope (HIM).<br /><br />The HIM (Orion-BU) has been demonstrated to be the only microscope that can achieve a resolution of &lt;5 Angstroms for a scanning microscope on bulk specimens. The use of Helium for imaging also offers some additional capabilities not available with other technologies. For one, the charging of the specimen by the He ions can easily be compensated with an electron flood gun. This allows imaging of insulating samples at the highest resolution allowing characterization of biological samples without coating in metal. Also, the reduced probe size in this microscope will allow advanced lithography capability for photonic crystals, micro-junction squids, and meta-materials. Finally, this microscope will capable of performing Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) on nanoscale areas. RBS is a powerful tool for material characterization that has been employed for many years. Until the advent of the HIM, RBS has been limited to beam-line sources and relatively large specimen areas. As a result, the HIM manufactured by Carl Zeiss is the only system that can meet the Government's minimum requirement.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), FOB destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, delivery and shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and /or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305-3328.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by July 29, 2010. A determination by the government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES), intends to negotiate with VAWD Engineering; Tucson, AZ, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the services described below.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Detection, Enforcement, and Inspection (DEI) program of OLES develops metrology to support the needs of the emergency response, law enforcement, and corrections communities. This includes through-barrier (walls, foliage, etc.) sensing and imaging. A through-barrier sensing system was previously purchased from VAWD Engineering to support our development of a long-range through-barrier system test and evaluation capability. This is a low-frequency application and may include tracking and surveillance of people behind walls, finding people (alive) buried in rubble, imaging people and objects through walls.</p>
<p>NIST intends to procure a software upgrade for this barrier sensing system which will allow NIST to implement our own analysis and simulation routines and to change acquisition-time control functions. Recent market research conducted by NIST shows that VAWD Engineering is the only authorized provider of this upgrade.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334511. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to VAWD for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by VAWD Engineering to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before July 21, 2010 at 12 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

The system (with cameras) is needed for scientific documentation of experimental data for publication or presentation by NHLBI investigators and for training in microsurgical procedures. This system will enable us to capture and edit video of microsurgical procedures done with the operating microscopes so the videos can be used as a permanent record of the procedures as well as for training and presentations by investigative staff. This high resolution system is necessary in order to capture the extremely fine detail of surgical procedures performed under operating microscopes.

Carl Zeiss is the manufacturer of our operating microscopes and this video camera system has been optimized for use with these operating microscopes. It is designed to mount directly to our existing microscopes so that the video camera is par focal with the oculars so the image displayed through the camera is identical to what the surgeons see through the microscope. This is critical for training and capturing high quality videos. This system from Carl Zeiss contains all the customized adapters and connectors to make it fully compatible with our existing equipment.

The MediLive MindStream package system shall include:
* (3) Medilive Mind Stream pkg. (15" touch screen monitor w/ 12v power supply, desk stand, cable set 2.0m).

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 16 is to obligate $22,000 in support of Work Assignment 2-100. The anticipated period of performance for this work assignment will be from July 9, 2010 though May 31, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-100, the contractor will provide support to EPA in its management and oversight of ARRA projects included in the interagency agreement between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) the contractor shall:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Develop a generic quality assurance project plan for water samples collected at completion of Drinking Water and Clean Water facility construction;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Develop draft and final meeting reports to assist the Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) and Office of Wastewater Management (OWM) with implementing the Protocols for Oversight of Tribal Projects Funded through an Interagency Agreement between EPA and IHS by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

The drawing states new pavement, however based upon pictures we have review which I have attached it appears there is existing pavement, so in light of that are we needing to demo the existing pavement and replace with new?  Please advise as to the intention.<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Yes, there is existing pavement, but it was damaged during IKE. There are several sink holes need to be fixed. The plan calls for a reinforced concrete pavement to replace the damaged asphalts pavement.<BR><BR>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 for full and open competition.</p>
<p>Background<br />The FDA has developed a non-specific viral detection method using degenerated PCR and high through-put sequencing. Our non-specific viral detection method has been successfully used to detect viral containments in vaccine related products including cell substrates and viral vaccines. Our laboratory will use this service contract to further update our non-specific viral detection method and perform testing on vaccine related products. In the past few years, one or both of these services have been provided by Cogenics, Macrogren, NCI/SAIC, Operon (now Eurofins) and Bioreliance. Cogenics was not cost-effective at last use, and there were issues with timeliness of deliverables, however the results were most favorable. It is our understanding these issues may have been resolved. NCI/SAIC (via IAA) offered the lowest price but due to lowered priority of FDA, the project timeline was delayed significantly resulting in an adverse effect on the overall project and mission requirement. Bioreliance offers deep sequencing but not the type of analysis required for 454 sequencing. Macrogen offers both methods/technologies, has provided excellent response time, customer service, and consistently reasonable pricing to our other labs.</p>
<p><br />The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for both Roche 454 pyrosequencing, and Illumina ultra deep sequencing service for viral vaccine analysis that meets or exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>Scope<br />&bull; The information will be used for discovery and quantification of viral contaminants in vaccine related products, including vaccines and cell substrates.<br />&bull; The main requirement is the maximum redundancy in sequencing, meaning that results for each sample must include tens of thousands of individual sequence determinations (reads)<br />&bull; Contractor shall utilize Roche's 454 instrument (also called pyrosequencing technology) AND<br />&bull; Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx.<br />&bull; Both should be used in the aforementioned project for its different aspects, as regulation of vaccines and relation products requires evaluation of various methodologies/technologies.<br />&bull; Process user furnished DNA libraries using user furnished protocols and primers (PCR products with specific 454 or Illumina primers) for both deep sequencing/454 methodologies and provide sequencing data.<br />&bull; No library construction is required.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />&bull; Analyze samples of amplicons or DNA libraries prepared from vaccine samples and vaccine derived viruses utilizing Roche's 454 instrument (also called pyrosequencing technology) 8/8 plate AND<br />&bull; Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx in both 1x36 bp and 2x101 bp format<br />&bull; Both deep sequencing methods shall be used concurrently in the aforementioned project for its different aspects, as both are required for regulatory evaluation of various methodologies/technologies used in vaccines/vaccine related products.<br />&bull; Process user furnished DNA libraries or amplicon with specific 454 or Illumina primers using user furnished protocols for both deep sequencing/454 methodologies and provide sequencing data.<br />&bull; Shall provide 5 runs of Roche 454 8/8 plate<br />&bull; Shall provide 3 LANES of Illumina 1x36 bp format (can be a single run)<br />&bull; Shall provide 1 run DNA sequencing 2x101 bp in Illumina format<br />&bull; Preferred overnight turn-around for delivery of data upon completion of runs/work, but not to exceed 48-72 turn around <br />&bull; Turnaround time from when FDA furnished samples are provided to furnishing of results should average approximately 4-6 weeks.<br />&bull; Vendor shall provide sequencing data results utilizing both methodologies/technologies via either secure web (FTP), CD and/or both. Deliver via secured web/internet connection (FTP) is preferred due to immediate access to results.<br />&bull; Entire project shall not exceed one year from date of award. (new sample sets may not be provided by user/FDA until results are provided from previous run)</p>
<p>Deliverables <br />Data results shall be provided by contractor via secure internet connection for immediate access upon completion of analysis may also be provided via CD/DVD</p>
<p>Period of performance<br />One year from date of contract award</p>
<p>FDA Provided Materials</p>
<p>FDA shall design and provide primers with MID (multiplex identifier)</p>
<p>FDA shall provide direct PCR products (amplicon with specific 454 or Illuminia primers) or DNA libraries for them to sequence</p>
<p>QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (george.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov) before 1:00 pm (1300) EST on 23 July 2010.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. <br /><br />Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," and 2) Price. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price. 3. Turn-around Time overnight, not to exceed 48-72 hours from each request. 4. Past Performance.</p>
<p>The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise an option line item.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the requirements provided in the quotation. Offerors shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.</p>

<p>Background checks as outlined below shall be accomplished prior to the first day of performance. Background checks shall be accomplished at no additional cost to the government.<br /><br /><strong>GENERAL<br /></strong><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.<br /><br /><strong>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION</strong><br /><br />DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS</strong><br /><br />Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contactor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:<br /><br />1. Standard Form 85P, "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions" Form will be submitted via e-QIP (electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing)<br />(2 copies)<br /><br />2. FD Form 258, "Fingerprint Card" (2 copies)<br /><br />3. Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement<br /><br />4.

Optional Form 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment" (applies to contractors as well)<br /><br />6. Authorization for Release of Medical Information<br /><br />Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of contract.<br />Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for the past three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.<br /><br />The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of, or maintenance to any DHS IT system.<br /><br /><strong>CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY</strong><br /><br />If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.<br />The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.<br /><br />The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.<br /><br />DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.<br /><br />The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.<br /><br />The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return, if issued, any expired DHS identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires.<br />(End of Clause)<br />52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.<br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />Economic Price Adjustment for Gasoline: The awarded prices for the option period line items, if exercised, shall be adjusted for increases/decreases in gasoline prices at time of exercise.<br /><br />(a) To the extent that contract cost increases/decreases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the vendor warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases (no increases for gasoline prices included in the option periods).<br /><br />(b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report, Current Price per Gallon for San Diego, California, unleaded regular, available at http://www.fuelgaugereport.com, as of July 14, 2010<br /><br />(1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be $3.11, the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation (rounded .5 and up, to the next higher number). This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.<br /><br />(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for San Diego, California Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.<br /><br />(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.<br /><br />(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.<br /><br />For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $3.50 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.65 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:<br /><br />Adjusting Index $3.65 per gallon<br />Minus the Base Index -$3.50 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index <br />$ .15 increase</p>
<p>Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00<br />Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00<br /><br />SEE ATTACHMENTS FOR PRICE SCHEDULE AND PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONAIRE</p>

****
Statement of Work for Support for Protecting the Magna Carta

1.	Background

The Magna Carta of October 12, 1297 was issued in the name of King Edward I of England.  The document is in Latin, written in brown ink on parchment in 68 lines of text.  A large fragment of the Great Seal of the King of England hangs from a doubled strip of parchment laced through a slit in the fold over at the bottom of the parchment sheet.  The document has repairs in several places along the horizontal folds and partial to complete loss of some text in small areas.   

The Magna Carta text is written on the recto of the parchment document.  There are minimal annotations on the reverse.  The document proper is ca. 15 inches wide by 18 inches high.  A pendant wax seal is suspended on a strip of parchment from the bottom of the document.  With seal and strip the total length of the document is approximately 27 inches.

After purchase in Great Britain, this Magna Carta came to the United States in 1983.  The only copy of the Magna Carta in the Americas, it has been on display at the National Archives Building for many of the years since 1983. Mr. David Rubenstein bought it at auction in December 2007. Mr. Rubenstein and the National Archives signed a loan agreement in 2008 returning the document to display at the National Archives. In accordance with the agreement the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides for the care and preservation of the Magna Carta while on exhibition at the National Archives. Work is underway to develop an agreement concerning a new encasement and display case for the Magna Carta, which will be the centerpiece of a new exhibit planned to showcase the Magna Carta. 

A new encasement for the Rubenstein Magna Carta will provide the primary preservation protection for the document.  A separate display case will provide physical security and other controls, and also will impact the preservation environment that will govern the encasement interior to which the document will be exposed.  The document will be stationary within its display case.  Lighting will be exterior to the encasement proper.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently designed and fabricated argon-filled encasements for high-profile documents for the Library of Congress’ Waldseemüller Map and NARA’s Charters of Freedom. This experience will be applied to the Magna Carta encasement.

2.	Parties

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent establishment in the executive branch of the United States Government.  NARA’s mission is to ensure, for the Citizen and the Public Servant, for the President and the Congress and the Courts, ready access to essential evidence.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

3.	Scope of Work

The contractor shall assist the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the design, assembly, testing, gas fill, and documentation of a new encasement for the Rubenstein Magna Carta. The primary design objective is to maintain a properly humidified anoxic (not to exceed 0.5% oxygen) environment for 10 years. The encasement body shall employ the aluminum solid-block design used for the Charters and Waldseemueller encasement, a glass top, twin seals between the glass and the encasement body with an intermediate helium-leak-detection space, and plumbing and instrumentation mounted on the outside wall of the encasement. The seal between the glass and the encasement body shall be elastomer O-rings. All plumbing shall be welded stainless steel and metallic seals. A pressure relief valve shall not be included in the encasement, but the gas inlet pressure during the gas flush shall be restricted to 12 mbar or less above ambient atmosphere. 

4.	Specific Task Requirements

The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, equipment and technical execution of this contract.  The Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities.  The Contractor shall:

a.	Encasement Design: Cooperate with the NIST design team to develop and test an improved clamping mechanism for the seal between the glass and the encasement body, and insure that the encasement design is compatible with the placement of plumbing, instrumentation, leak detection ports and the gas-flow requirements for the inert gas fill. Sketches with critical dimensions for plumbing and test fixtures shall be submitted to and discussed with the NIST design team, and used by NIST to generate proper shop drawings when needed (whether for fabrication or documentation purposes). 

b.	Instrument Selection: Provide for the NIST Technical Information Contact’s (TIC’s) approval suggested instrumentation specifications, including specific models and cost. NARA is expected to evaluate archival compatibility of all sensors. Instrumentation for attachment to the encasement will include sensors for humidity, temperature, oxygen, and pressure. 

These instruments shall include self-contained electronics and visual displays. After the TIC’s approval, full specification, cost and contact information shall be provided for NIST procurement use. 


c.	Gas Handling System: Design plumbing that accommodates the approved instrumentation, allows for inert-gas fill, and maintains a leak rate that will not compromise the anoxic lifetime. Provide a list of components with part numbers and cost for purchase by NIST. Provide sketches of modifications and purpose-built parts for NIST fabrication and welding. Clean and leak test components, assemble and leak test final assemblies.  

The Contractor shall ensure that purchased materials shall meet the following requirements:

•	The valves used with the Charters encasements are clean and have proven high reliability. 
•	A sample of each of these two valves shall be helium leak tested to determine long-term leak rates using a NIST-fabricated test fixture and either a NIST or NARA helium leak detector. 

d.	Encasement Assembly and Testing: In collaboration with NIST, assemble and test the completed encasement prior to delivery to NARA. The plumbing and its attachments to the encasement body will have been leak tested prior to assembly of the glass. The seal between the glass and the body will be helium leak tested after assembly. 

Pressure test the assembled, but empty, encasement to the limits determined by the prescribed range of ambient temperatures and pressures (-130 mbar to 170 mbar, assuming initial gas fill at 23oC and 1000 mbar). The helium leak rate through the seal will be monitored throughout this test. 

Note that no helium leak test of the entire fully-assembled encasement is proposed. The solid-block construction proposed for the Magna Carta has proven to be highly reliable (Charters and Waldseemueller encasements) and the substantial expense of a fully-assembled encasement helium leak test does not appear to be warranted. 

e.	Encasement Sealing and Flushing In collaboration with NARA and NIST, assemble the encasement with document in place, helium leak test the glass seal and flush the encasement with humidified argon, using the NARA helium leak detector, Licor humidifier, argon flow controllers, high-purity argon, pressure regulator, water U-tube, chilled-mirror hygrometer, and associated stainless-steel hose, fittings, and valves. During the flush the encasement exhaust gas shall be monitored with the onboard oxygen sensor and the external chilled-mirror hygrometer.

The water U-tube shall be used to limit the input pressure to the encasement to 12 mbar or 0.2 psi, less than one tenth of the previously tested pressure limits of the encasement. 
f.	Encasement Monitoring and Documentation Collaborate with NARA to analyze monitoring data for six months following final seal of the encasement. Prepare a document with details of the installed plumbing and instrumentation and data analysis procedures. Prepare a user guide for the gas flush apparatus and the oxygen monitoring of the exhaust gas. 
&#8195;
5.	Deliverables and Deliverable Due Dates

The contractor shall provide the following deliverables:

a.	Encasement design as CAD drawings is due no later than ten (10) months after award of this requirement.
b.	Instrumentation specifications, specific model, and cost are due no later than ten (10) months after award of this requirement.

<DESC>Project: Research Report on Hawaiian Monk Seals in Native Hawaiian Culture.
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />1. Background</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO), Protected Resources Division (PRD) is responsible for protecting and recovering endangered and threatened species of sea turtles, monk seals, and cetaceans as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Through management, conservation and recovery efforts, and public outreach and education, PRD strives to ensure the recovery and survival of the protected marine species of the Pacific Islands Region for future generations.<br /><br />Currently, recovery of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal is a high priority for NMFS. Although the overall population of Hawaiian monk seals is in decline, their numbers appear to be increasing in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). This increase is particularly important for monk seal recovery. In 2009, three monk seals were shot to death, in what appear to be intentional killings. It has been revealed in public meetings and other venues that a significant number of people in the MHI have unfavorable views about monk seals and consider the seals to be a threat to fishery-based livelihoods. Among some Native Hawaiians, a belief has been expressed that Hawaiian monk seals have never naturally occurred in the MHI. Accordingly, they believe monk seals have no part in their natural or cultural heritage. Some Hawaiians, therefore, believe they have no responsibility to protect monk seals. Some information, however, suggests that Hawaiian culture was once connected to monk seals. Evidence of this connection has not been thoroughly examined or compiled. If past presence of seals in the MHI and/or a meaningful cultural significance of monk seals in Hawaiian culture could be documented, Native Hawaiians who now consider monk seals to be an introduced species may change their views and the Native Hawaiian community at large would perhaps be more accepting and supportive of monk seal conservation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to produce a research report on the significance Hawaiian monk seals in Native Hawaiian culture. This project is considered by NMFS as a step towards facilitating an informed dialogue with Native Hawaiians regarding their most appropriate role in monk seal protection. The report will provide information that can be used to share with Native Hawaiians and others about Hawaiian monk seals in traditional Hawaiian culture. Such information could help lay a foundation for discussing the possibility of monk seal conservation as part of Native Hawaiian community activities and priorities. The report also will provide new information of historical importance for management documents such as recovery plans and public outreach materials.</p>
<p><br />2. Scope and Objectives</p>
<p>The goal of this study is to prepare a report summarizing information regarding the significance of Hawaiian monk seals in Native Hawaiian culture. The study will compile and describe references from various sources regarding the presence and history of Hawaiian monk seals in the MHI and/or the traditional Hawaiian value, use, or other significance of seals, if any.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this study are to compile, analyze, and report relevant information from:</p>
<p>&bull; A literature search of academic texts and other scholarly documents<br />&bull; A search for records in Hawaiian language newspapers <br />&bull; Traditional knowledge within the Native Hawaiian community, revealed via various sources including ethnographic interviews with Hawaiian elders and cultural experts</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, PRD requires a Contractor who is a widely recognized as an expert and scholar of Native Hawaiian culture, history, traditions, and practices. The scope of work includes conducting ethnographic research via gathering, compiling, and analyzing primary and secondary information from a variety of sources, and presenting the results of the research in a report that is thorough, academically rigorous, and understandable to a diverse range of readers. The research report delivered via this contract will be used by NMFS and its partners to enhance Hawaiian monk seal recovery program efforts.</p>

<DESC>Project: Ni&lsquo;ihau Hawaiian Monk Seal Population Assessment and Incident Response
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />1. Background</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO), Protected Resources Division (PRD) is dedicated to protecting and recovering endangered and threatened species of sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Through management, conservation and recovery efforts, and public outreach and education, PRD strives to ensure the recovery and survival of the protected marine species of the Pacific Islands Region for future generations.<br /><br />Currently, recovery of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal is a high priority for NMFS. Although the overall population of Hawaiian monk seals is in decline, their numbers appear to be increasing in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). This MHI population increase is particularly important for monk seal recovery, and scientifically monitoring and documenting this population increase throughout the MHI is a NMFS priority. Monk seals are known to use the waters and shoreline areas of the island of Ni&lsquo;ihau, and the island's owners and residents have offered information and reports regarding monk seals on numerous occasions over the past several years. However, detailed and long-term population assessment data regarding Ni&lsquo;ihau's monk seals are thus far extremely limited. Furthermore, an on-island monk seal incident response program for Ni&lsquo;ihau to effectively respond to injured and sick monk seals has not yet been fully developed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to implement a population assessment and incident response program for Hawaiian monk seals on and around the island of Ni&lsquo;ihau, in close collaboration with the island's owners and residents. This multi-year project will provide invaluable scientific data regarding the Hawaiian monk seal population and habitat use on and around Ni&lsquo;ihau, as well as support the timely and humane response to monk seals that are found injured, sick, or entangled.</p>
<p><br />2. Scope and Objectives</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to conduct Hawaiian monk seal population assessment surveys on as many beaches and accessible haul out areas on Ni&lsquo;ihau as practicable. The surveys will be conducted at least once per month, with emphasis on logging numbers and locations of individual seals, and photographically documenting individual seals for identification purposes. Responses to injured, sick, or entangled seals will be conducted as needed in close coordination with, and under the authority and oversight of, the NMFS marine mammal health and stranding response program.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>&bull; Collect, compile, and deliver Hawaiian monk seal sighting and distribution data for the island of Ni&lsquo;ihau on a consistent, long-term basis to support NMFS in the population assessment of Hawaiian monk seals in the MHI<br />&bull; Provide first responder support for injured, sick, or entangled monk seals in close coordination with NMFS</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, PRD requires a Contractor who has unrestricted access to the privately owned island of Ni&lsquo;ihau, and who is capable and willing to receive training from NMFS and thereafter conduct the population assessment and incident response support tasks described in this scope of work. The scope of this project includes residing for prolonged periods of time on the privately owned island of Ni&lsquo;ihau, conducting wildlife population field research for several days every month along the shorelines of Ni&lsquo;ihau, compiling and delivering wildlife population field research results, and supporting marine wildlife rescue and incident responses.</p>
<p><br />3. Tasks</p>

<p>Task 1. Conduct initial project inception meeting and maintain regular contact with PRD</p>
<p>Before initiating significant work on the project, the Contractor shall convene a meeting with the technical point-of-contact staff person(s) designated by PRD to discuss the overall strategy of the project and other aspects of the project. The Contractor shall also contact PRD regularly (at least once every month) via email or telephone to provide a brief update on the progress of the project.</p>
<p>Task 2. Participate in NMFS training</p>
<p>The Contractor shall attend and actively participate in a training session on population survey methods and first responder protocols. The training will be provided by NMFS on the island of O&lsquo;ahu and will require participation by the Contractor for approximately eight hours per day for five days. All associated travel costs shall be included in the Contractor's project budget.</p>
<p>Task 3. Conduct Hawaiian monk seal population assessment field research</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct field work necessary for the assessment of the Hawaiian monk seal population of Ni&lsquo;ihau in a manner consistent with the methods presented in the training discussed in Task 2 above. In general, all monk seals sighted around the accessible shoreline of Ni&lsquo;ihau shall be recorded on a paper log in the field and transcribed to computer spreadsheet using the format provided by NMFS during the training discussed above. The entire length of accessible shoreline shall be surveyed at least once every four weeks to the maximum extent practicable considering weather, surf heights, and other factors related to human safety and logistical feasibility. Information collected will be per individual seal as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Date, time, location (lat/long and beach name), NMFS flipper ID tag number and color (if any), photo numbers, and additional notes, such as seal body condition, behaviors, etc.<br />&bull; A map of Ni&lsquo;ihau shall also be included with the log specifying the areas surveyed and associated survey dates<br />&bull; Photos: A digital SLR with zoom lens and GPS geo-coding capability will be provided by NMFS for use by the Contractor in obtaining clear, close-up photos of individual seals for identification purposes. Photos shall be downloaded and organized on a computer in digital file folders organized by date and separated by individual seal.</p>

<SOLNBR>PIRO-10-0537
<RESPDATE>072910
<CONTACT>Denise Rogers, Phone 808-944-2208, Fax 808-973-2941, Email DENISE.ROGERS@NOAA.GOV
<DESC>National Marine Fisheries Service<br />Pacific Islands Regional Office<br />Sustainable Fisheries Division
<p>NEPA Support for Fisheries Management Measures in the Western Pacific</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>June 22, 2010</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act or MSA) contains provisions to ensure the nation's fisheries are sustainably managed. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries or NMFS) works in coordination with the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) to manage federal fisheries of the western Pacific region. New fishery management measures are subject to provisions of the MSA and other laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In the western Pacific region, NMFS Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD), at the direction of the Regional Administrator, Pacific Islands Region (PIR), is responsible for preparing fishery management proposals that comply with MSA, NEPA, and other laws and provide a sound legal basis for decision making.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Contract is to obtain assistance from a qualified contractor to assist SFD in preparing NEPA-related work. The services provided under this Contract will consist of reviewing drafts, developing scoping and working plans, drafting portions of Environmental Assessments (EAs), and drafting preliminary decision documents (Finding of No Significant Impact or FONSIs) based on the environmental impact analysis. The services may include extracting data from published literature and governmental sources, obtaining expert reviews, providing input on environmental impact analysis sections of environmental assessments, and developing detailed comments on documents to help ensure compliance with NEPA and the Office of Environmental Quality Control regulations implementing NEPA.</p>
<p>SFD seeks contractor assistance on reviewing five sustainable fishery management environmental assessments (EAs) of moderate complexity and drafting five FONSI statements based on the EA analyses. Initial documents will be drafted by the Council or SFD staff and provided to the contractor as drafts for review and recommendations on upgrading the analyses for compliance with NEPA and in accordance with sound fishery management practices. In accordance with NEPA, all documents are required to describe the existing fishery and baseline environmental impacts and describe potential impacts of proposed fishery management alternatives on specific target fisheries, non-target fisheries, bycatch issues, impacts on Essential Fish Habitat, Habitat Areas of Particular Concern, endangered species, and other direct, indirect, short-term, long-term, and cumulative impacts. The NEPA analysis work may also involve studies on the impacts of particular specifications, allocations, or other management measures on members of affected fishing communities.</p>
<p><br />2. Tasks, Deliverables, and Monitoring</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review and/or prepare portions of EA documents and draft FONSIs on fishery management measures for the pelagic, bottomfish and seamount, crustacean, precious coral, and coral reef ecosystem fisheries of the western Pacific region.</p>
<p>Contractor shall prepare and deliver to SFD written comments resulting from the reviews, or edits to draft documents. The reviews shall assess the extent to which the documents comply with NEPA, or, in the case of portions of NEPA documents, shall provide SFD with information that will contribute to the sound environmental impact analyses required by NEPA and agency requirements.</p>
<p>The output from review work, or document drafts shall be delivered electronically using Word program.</p>
<p>The Contractor will have three weeks from the request for review to delivery on EAs, and two weeks from the request for review to deliver draft FONSI documents.</p>
<p>The Contractor's performance shall be monitored and evaluated by SFD NEPA Specialist and approved by the SFD Assistant Regional Administrator (ARA). The performance evaluation will be prepared according to the guidelines provided in DAO-216-13, "Evaluation of the Results of Advisory and Assistance Contracts."</p>
<p>SFD is seeking assistance with reviewing a total of five EAs and development of five FONSIs during the period of performance.</p>
<p>Task 1. The first task is expected to be available in September 2010 and will consist of a Pelagics FEP amendment and EA covering a proposed adjustment to the bycatch retention limit for swordfish in the Hawaii deep-set fishery. The contractor will assist SFD by providing a NEPA compliance review which will include an evaluation of the purpose and need, the range of alternatives and their description, baseline impact analysis, and impacts to resources as listed in "1. Background" section, above. Direct, indirect, short-term, long-term, and cumulative impacts will be analyzed in the document. As part of the compliance review the Contractor will make recommendations and/or provide any additional information or analysis that is needed. The contractor will draft a FONSI based on the final EA.</p>
<p>Based on recent EAs and FONSIs developed for the western Pacific region, Task 1 will take approximately 40 hours (5 days).</p>
<p>Task 2. The second task is expected to be available in the Fall of 2010. As described for Task 1, Task 2 will consist of reviewing and improving the NEPA portion of an integrated Pelagics FEP amendment and EA covering a proposed adjustment to the limited entry permit system in the American Samoa-based longline fishery and developing a draft FONSI.</p>
<p>Based on recent EAs and FONSIs developed for the western Pacific region, Task 2 will take approximately 40 hours (5 days).</p>
<p>Details of the other three tasks are not yet developed. In general, SFD will have three additional combined FEP amendment/EA documents that will need NEPA compliance review and development of draft FONSI which SFD estimates will take approximately 40 hours (5 days) per task.</p>
<p>For this contract, the Contractor would not be writing the EA document; rather, the Contractor will be reviewing and providing recommendations for improving any missing fisheries information; fish and other resource impact information; and making suggestions for completing a sound NEPA analysis. The Contractor will be drafting FONSI documents as part of the contract.</p>
<p>To see a sample of a draft FMP/EA document of moderate complexity similar to the work requested in this scope of work, bidders can request a digital copy of "Draft Amendment 15 to the Pacific Pelagics FMP including an Environmental Assessment" by calling: (808) 944-2265; or obtain it through the internet at http://www.wpcouncil.org/ and then searching the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's website for "Pacific Pelagics Amendment 15".</p>
<p>SFD will provide the contractor with information regarding agency requirements specific to the content of a FONSI for a proposed fishery management action.</p>
<p>Bidders are asked to provide a quote based on reviewing and improving a total of five draft EAs and developing an associated draft FONSI document (5 total FONSI documents).</p>
<p>3. Contractor Qualifications</p>
<p>The Contractor or Contractor's assigned personnel must have a minimum of a Bachelors Degree in the natural sciences and be knowledgeable in fisheries management, general knowledge of fishery stock assessment methodologies and population dynamics of marine animals, preferably fish, or a minimum of 3 years of experience with developing impact analyses for fisheries resource management in the Pacific Islands region. The Contractor must have a minimum of 3 years developing and reviewing NEPA documents, preferably related to fishery projects in the western Pacific region.</p>
<p>Selection criteria: Because the work is specialized, applicants will be evaluated for expertise in pelagic, bottomfish, crustaceans precious corals, and coral reef fisheries management in the western Pacific region including fisheries of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Hawaii, and U.S. Pacific Remote Island Areas; and impacts of these fisheries to resources of the western Pacific region. The selected Contractor will also have specific fisheries-related NEPA experience.</p>
<p>Bidders should provide a summary statement of capabilities to help SFD evaluate these competencies and qualifications.</p>
<p>4. Schedule of Work</p>
<p>NMFS shall provide the Contractor with schedules for specific tasks. These schedules are subject to change. Completion of the services and deliverables for specific tasks is contingent on SFD providing documents for review to the Contractor in a timely manner. Delay in providing those materials to the Contractor may cause unavoidable delays in deliverables under this Contract. Adjustments in work schedule and project tasks may be made by mutual consent. The Contractor shall immediately advise the SFD NEPA Specialist of any conditions that are likely to cause problems in meeting any schedules.</p>
<p>5. Costs, Payment Rate, and Billing</p>

<p>Project title: Ecology and Oceanography of the toxigenic marine alga, Heterosigma akashiwo</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATIONS</strong><br />Recurring threats from Heterosigma akashiwo have caused extensive damage ($2-6 million per episode) to wild and net-penned fish of Puget Sound, Washington, and are believed to be increasing in scope and magnitude in this region, and elsewhere in the world over the past two decades. The mechanism of H. akashiwo toxicity is not well understood. This project fulfills the NOAA mission of sustaining important fisheries (including aquacultured fish) harvest in Puget Sound. This project will provide accurate and timely information on the toxicity of Heterosigma akashiwo.</p>
<p>Objective: To test Heterosigma akashiwo toxicity and to characterization the phytoplankton assemblage that persists with toxic Heterosigma akashiwo.</p>
<p>Period of performance:<br />Date of award to July 31, 2011 with the option of two additional years.</p>
<p>Option Year 1: August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012</p>
<p>Option Year 2: August 1, 2012 to July 31, 2013</p>
<p><br />Services to be provided:<br />From the period of date of award to July 31, 2011, detailed work outlined below will be performed by the contractor to support a NOAA NWFSC-led program to characterize Heterosigma akashiwo blooms and related toxicity in Puget Sound:</p>
<p>Task 1: Characterize microbial community structure<br />To assess microbial community structure using modern flow cytometry and flow-cam particle image analysis. Vendor will assist with sample acquisition and preservation. Vendor will provide results of fresh or preserved samples within 1 month of collection.</p>
<p>Task 2: Screen samples for toxicity using multiple methods<br />To perform time-sensitive toxicity screening methods: exoenzyme production, and hemolytic activity. Samples will be sent to Vendor's lab for immediate analysis of Heterosigma toxicity (within 2-3 days) due the unstable nature of these biological responses.<br /><br />Task 3: Perform calcium transport assays<br />To assess an experimental protocol for the assessment of cellular toxin levels using a flow cytometer-based Ca+ transport fluorochrome and specially modified cell lines.</p>
<p>Task 4: Training in Use of FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Flow Cam laser based imaging system<br />Vendor will train NWFSC staff in the use of this equipment for field research in Puget Sound. This will include vendor traveling to NWFSC to provide training and install equipment. Vendor will insure equipment is operational, calibrated, and repair, as necessary.</p>
<p>Task 5: Equipment to be furnished by vendor<br />Vendor will provide a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Flow Cam laser-based imaging system for rapid assessment of community structure and toxin levels in this project for use in Puget Sound. Vendor will have same equipment in their lab for conducting assessments.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />(1) Vendor must have past experience in the deconstruction of Heterosigma toxicity. Three years or more would be optimum.<br />(2) Vendor must have past experience in defining the size and activity of intracellular toxin using flow cytometry.<br />(3) Vendor must have previous experience conducting these assessments in the coastal waters of Washington State.<br />(4) Vendor must have experience using of FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Flow Cam laser based imaging system, to include installation, calibration, and troubleshooting equipment problems.<br />(5) Vendor must provide a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Flow Cam laser-based imaging system and train NWFSC staff scientist on operating these instruments in the Puget Sound area.<br />(6) Vendor must be able to travel to Seattle, Washington at a requested time the Point of Contact and vendor agrees on.</p>

(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 JULY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 23 JULY 2010.

This procurement is to obtain a contract for the purpose installing eyewash and deluge shower and mixing valves at the VA Omaha location.  The following is the Statement of Work we are requesting this contractor to complete for us.

Water tubing to be type L copper, soft soldered connections.  Waste piping to be no hub cast iron, and acid waste in the research facility.  Fusion welded connections.  Temperature and water pressure gauges and regulators required at each mixing valve outlet.  Wall penetration must be properly fire caulked, water piping to be installed and properly labeled with the respective to the pipe insulated.  Contractor will provide fire extinguisher and obtain burn hot work permits for each area work is performed.  No hot work shall be permitted without obtaining an all clear from safety as to smoke detectors and heat detectors as to not have false alarms.  Contractor will trace lines to find isolation valves and obtain permission from engineering before closing any water valves or cutting into any waste or drain lines.  Some work may have to be accomplished during weekend or night hours if water cannot be shut off during business hours.  This will need to be coordinated with engineering and respective departments affected in advance.  Work areas to be cleaned up at end of work day and kept clear of debris.  Dust and noise will be kept as low as possible.  HEPA filters may be required in certain areas.  Other areas may require special precautions to prevent disease spread and will be up to Department managers in some areas.  If the contractor can safely freeze some water lines to prevent widespread shut down of water this can be discussed as an option on this entire project on a case by case basis.  Check with engineering.  VA hospital plumbers will assist in locating valves as time permits, but contractor will need to trace lines as best as they can before asking for VA employee assistance.  If isolation valves arenâ€™t available or inoperable this will have to be discussed with engineering before any changes can be made.  Research building has all new isolation valves throughout the facility.  This should not be an issue in that building. 

Increases to this contract will only be authorized by the contracting officer. All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, July 19, 2010 will be considered by the Government.  Contractors will provide contract terms.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by email at lee.reiff@va.gov.

<DESC>The purposes of Amendment I to the solicitation are as follows:
<p>1. To provide responses to questions posed by potential Offerors.<br />2. To attach a Revised Minimum Specifications I&nbsp;document to reflect the changes noted in the responses to the questions.</p>
<p>Below are the questions posed with their respective responses from NIST:<br />Q: In section 6, Software, Maui is requested. Cluster Resources/Adaptive Computing explicitly precludes any hardware vendor from installing this software. Is NIST aware of this license restriction, and will NIST be able to download and install this software?<br />A: NIST was not aware of the licensing restrictions of the Maui scheduler which restrict the software distribution to be between Cluster Resources or its authorized distribution and services partners and end users. NIST can obtain and configure the Maui software from Cluster Resources without vendor assistance. The attached document entitled Revised Minimum Specifications I&nbsp;shows that Maui is no longer a requirement.</p>
<p>Q: Also in section 6, are both Portland Group and Intel compilers required? For an Intel based cluster, Intel is highly recommended over Portland Group. <br />A: Both types of compilers are required for this cluster.</p>
<p>Q: In section 7, you indicate available power consists of three L5-30 120V single-phase receptacles. Do you have the ability to any more of these, as we don't believe it will be enough to power this cluster?<br />A: We have examined the machine-room environment, and there is additional power available from several (up to four) NEMA 5-20R 120V outlets. Note that all power reaching the machines must be UPS-backed.</p>
<p>All Offerors shall use this amendment when composing and submitting proposals. Please see the attached document entitled revised Minimum Specifications I.</p>

<p><br />COAL MINING PROCESS TECHNICAL REVIEW SUPPORT</p>
<p><br />I. Introduction</p>
<p>On April 2, 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region III (EPA) published and sought public comment on a proposal under the Clean Water Act to restrict or prohibit discharges associated with mountain top mining at the Spruce No. 1 surface mine in Logan County, West Virginia. Additional information about the Spruce No. 1 mine and EPA's proposal can be found at http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/spruce1.html. Additional information about existing mining practices, policies, and regulations can be found at http://www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/guidance/mining.html.</p>
<p>II. Objective:</p>
<p>In order to support EPA's review of this project, EPA is seeking support in performing a technical assessment of potential alternative mining practices at the Spruce project site. The contractor shall assist in the analysis and/or evaluation of alternative designs that have the potential to minimize environmental impacts at the project site.</p>
<p>III. Task Descriptions:</p>
<p>Technical information and collaboration with EPA Region III and EPA Headquarters will be a vital part of the contract. All work on specific practices or policies must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Deliverables shall conform to EPA standards for double sided copying and shall be presented on electronic media to the extent practicable. The contractor shall track and report expenditures by task to allow accurate accounting of activities. All deliverable products under this contract are the property of EPA.</p>
<p>Task # 1 - Spruce No. 1 Project Scoping <br />1.1 An initial scoping conference call will be convened by the COR within seven (7) calendar days of contract award. <br />1.2 Contract review calls will occur weekly with the COR to confirm the status of tasks and discuss any scoping issues.<br />Estimated level of effort: 50 hours</p>
<p>Task #2: Review and Evaluation of Alternatives for Spruce <br />At the direction of the COR, the contractor shall review the authorized Spruce No. 1 mine design and construction method and provide a technical assessment. Review may include one or more of the following categories of project assessment related to potential alternatives and minimization techniques that would result in less environmental resource impacts at the project site:<br /><br />&bull; Alternative potential project locations within a given area defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential project site designs to meet needs defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential project construction sequence and/or methods defined by EPA.<br />&bull; Alternative potential waste and wastewater treatment methods defined by EPA.</p>
<p>All review of potential project alternatives shall include estimates of cost and level of extraction and/or extraction efficiency for the proposed alternatives. All review of potential project alternatives also shall include a review of each alternative's "practicability" as defined at 40 CFR Section 230.10(a)(2) "An alternative is practicable if it is as available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes." The term "cost" should be considered as including the cost of constructing the alternatives compared to the project as currently authorized under the issued Clean Water Act Section 404 permit and the impact of each alternative to the economic viability of the project as a coal extraction activity.</p>
<p>EPA will provide the background materials on the project and the alternatives to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Estimated level of effort: 500 hours</p>
<p>Task #3: Comment Review and Evaluation<br />At the direction of the COR, the contractor shall review EPA selected comments submitted by the public in response to EPA's Proposed Determination on Spruce No. 1 and provide EPA with a technical assessment of the comments as they relate to mine design and construction methods, including alternative potential project locations, site designs, construction sequence and/or methods, and/or waste and wastewater treatment methods. The technical assessment shall include evaluation and estimates of cost, level of extraction and/or extraction efficiency, and practicability of alternatives discussed and/or proposed in the comments.</p>
<p>Estimated level of effort: 200 hours</p>
<p>Task #4: Report <br />The contractor shall prepare a report including the review and analysis of the Spruce project, potential alternative designs, and comments on the Spruce Proposed Determination as discussed above detailing technical recommendations, cost estimates of alternatives, and the practicability of minimizing environmental impacts at the project site.<br />The contractor shall submit a draft report no later than fourteen days (14) before the final report is due. EPA comments on draft report shall identify whether additional information is needed. <br />Estimated level of effort: 400 hours</p>
<p>Task #5: Option for Continuing Review<br />The contractor shall be available to respond to questions and/or comments on any proposed alternative designs and costs from Task 2 and provide technical recommendations on potential project design changes as a result of this alternatives analysis. <br />Estimated level of effort: 1,000 hours</p>
<p>IV. Period of Performance</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this contract shall be through March 30, 2011. The Government reserves the right to extend the period through September 30, 2011 if the Task #5 option is exercised.</p>
<p>V. Estimated Level of Effort</p>
<p>The subsequent contract is estimated to include a level of effort of 1,150 hours for the base period. An option for up to an additional 1,000 hours of effort for Task #5 will be available as described in the FAR Clause 52.217-9.</p>
<p>VI. Other Direct Costs (ODC)</p>
<p>The Government estimates that there could be up to $15,000 in ODCs for each the base period and the option period. This amount will not be added to the contractor's quoted prices for evaluation purposes. ODCs are reimbursable not to exceed (NTE) amounts that will be available in both the base and option period. ODCs include travel, photocopying, and delivery services.</p>
<p>TRAVEL (If required). All travel shall be conducted in accordance with the Government Federal Travel Regulations (FTR). Travel shall only be in direct support of this purchase order. The contractor shall provide the following information to the COR for approval prior to incurring travel costs: destination, duration, arrangements, estimated costs, date, and time of travel. Any travel incurred without prior approval may be subject to non-reimbursement. Documentation and receipts for travel activities shall be sent to the COR at time of invoice submission for reimbursement.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to BAA 10-10 is to revise the Anticipated Schedule of Events listed on page 17 of BAA10-10 and to provide&nbsp;clarifications to all offerors submitting&nbsp;full proposals.<br /><br />The updated Anticipated Schedule of Events is as follows:<br /><br />Invitations to submit full proposals sent out -&nbsp;14 July 2010.<br />FULL PROPOSAL WEBSITE REGISTRATION DEADLINE&nbsp;- 29 July 2010.<br />FULL PROPOSAL DUE DATE&nbsp;- 4 August 2010<br />Notification of selection for award negotiations -&nbsp;30 August 2010.<br /><br />Instructions to all offerors submitting full proposals. <br /><br />As a clarification for all offerors submitting Full Proposals, please note the following items:<br /><br />A. The Government will, as part of this effort, request that offerors use a pre-determined image data set to perform preliminary data processing for demonstration purposes. Each offeror will be asked that its team members sign a non-competitive non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which will allow the Government to release these images. <br /><br />The implications on vendors and software developers are as follows:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. For vendors, where &lsquo;vendor' is defined as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for AIT hardware and coordinating software that is currently either on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)'s Qualified Products List (QPL) or in process to be tested for Qualification: a vendor will receive image data for the system it produces and will not be allowed any image data from other vendors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. For potential vendors, where &lsquo;potential vendor' is defined as those OEMs who produce AIT system hardware and coordinating software that have not yet entered the Qualification approval process: upon signing this agreement, the potential vendor agrees that it will not submit an AIT system for approval to the QPL for five years after contract award.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. For algorithm developers, where &lsquo;algorithm developer' is defined as those offerors who do not produce AIT hardware, but will produce algorithms that are intended to be integrated onto those systems on the TSA QPL: the offeror may receive any image data produced by S&amp;T for evaluation of this effort. However, if the algorithm developer forms a teaming agreement to team with any vendor (as defined above), then that algorithm developer waives its right to receive data from any vendor and may receive image data only from the system of the vendor it has teamed with. <br /><br />The offeror has the right to waive the offer for the image data, however the offeror must also present sufficient rationale as part of its proposal regarding how its algorithms will process relevant AIT images.
<p>B. The offeror will observe the Assertion of Data Rights detailed requirements of the BAA and the statement in paragraph 1.8.2 that the "Government also reserves the right to ownership of the ATR Algorithms (including source and executable code) after final delivery," with respect to the amount of intellectual property it puts forward in support of this effort. The offeror will state what components of its effort that it intends to retain as intellectual property as part of the proposal. <br /><br />C. The offeror must be able to handle Sensitive Security Information to perform this effort, and will include its capability to do so and other relevant clearance information for both the offeror's personnel and facility as part of this effort. <br /><br />D. The offeror will include as part of its proposal information on funding sought from other sources in support of this effort. Additionally, the offeror will explain how that funding will supplement the effort being proposed to this BAA.<br /><br /><br />PLEASE BE SURE TO ADHERE TO ALL INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED IN BAA10-10. IN ADDITION BE SURE TO READ ALL AMEMDMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS ISSUED REGARDING BAA 10-10. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS PLEASE CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER EMILY GRAHAM VIA E-MAIL&nbsp;ON (Emily.Graham@dhs.gov) OR VIA TELEPHONE ON 202-254-5611.</p>

<DESC>Clarification #1 to Request For Information (RFI) #3
<p>Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1. A communication from a company that plans to respond to RFI#3 informed us that the company does not fully understand the requirements for a response to this RFI. The company stated it will respond to the "second part" of the RFI but did not demonstrate correct awareness of what comprises the "second part". The company thought the RFI questions were to address either one of the two factors mentioned in I(2)(a) of RFI#3.</p>
<p>SMC's response: A respondent to RFI#3 has the option of providing the information requested in II(3) and II(5) (aka Question 1, or "Section A" per the RFI), or to answer II(6) (aka Question 2, or "Section B" per the RFI), or to answer both questions. For each question, a respondent must address the factors in listed in II(4) as directed in II(4) and II(6)(a). The two requirements listed in I(2)(a), must both be addressed as part of an answer to Question 1. The factors listed in II(4) drill down on those requirements and provide you with an outline for your response.</p>
<p>2. A couple companies have asked whether they should or could include a revised response to RFI#2 as part of their response to RFI#3</p>
<p>SMC's response: No. Please provide two documents: (1) a revised RFI#2 (if you responded to that RFI and plan to revise your response) by July 26 and (2) a separate response to RFI#3. Companies that responded to RFI#2 have already been notified by e-mail of the option to revise their responses and the suspense for that revision (COB July 26). The revision to RFI#2 must adhere to the format and requirements of RFI#2; respondents are encouraged to use the templates they already prepared. RFI#3 requirements mandate use of a substantially different template (more complex outline, much more information requested and larger page limits). The documents may not be merged.</p>
<p>3. One company also asked whether subcontractors would have to certify their business size according to the size limit ($27M) imposed by the final NAICS code chosen for LISC - 541330 Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons).</p>
<p>SMC's response: In all cases, to qualify as a small business, subcontractors must meet the size standard (see 13 CFR 121) for the NAICS code of the subcontract. The prime contractor is required to assign a NAICS code to each subcontract, based on the nature of the work being subcontracted, using the 2007 North American Industrial Classification System coding manual and the footnotes in 13 CFR 121. Subcontracted work which is similar to the basic contract should use the same assigned NAICS (in this case 541330). While the prime is not bound to use the same NAICS code for all effort that is subcontracted which is similar in nature to the contract NAICS code assigned for the prime contract, deviations must clearly fit the NAICS description chosen. In other words, a company planning to bid as a prime can assign different NAICS codes to subcontracts but must be prepared to defend its use as appropriate in light of the work performed on the subcontract; a NAICS code cannot be picked for the sole reason to obtain a larger size limit than that imposed by NAICS code 541330.</p>
<p>Point of Contact: <br />Primary: Mr. George Sullivan, contract specialist, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil <br />or (310) 653-1772 <br />Alternate: Ms. Van Choat, Government Contracting Officer, at van.choat@losangeles.af.mil or (310) 653-2488</p>
<p>DECLARATION: All other aspects of RFI #3 (e.g. response due date, white paper content and form requirements, submission format, etc.) posted on FBO on 1 July 2010 remain unchanged. This posting is issued for clarification purposes only.</p>

<DESC>Please submit your quotes to the&nbsp;primary contact listed in the synopsis.&nbsp; Under the contemplated contract action, ViaSat, Inc. will provide RIMS spares equipment (items shown in the table below) needed to allow quick turn-around when outages occur . The RIMS is a principal part of the RSTN which consists of four solar radio observatory systems geographically positioned such that solar radio frequencies can be observed on a 24 hour-per-day basis. It automatically monitors, collects, quantifies and reports solar radio events on eight discrete frequencies using three parabolic dish antennas. Both standard reports and alerts are produced when appropriate. Data is processed on-site at each network location and summaries and alerts are forwarded to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). Processed data is transmitted continuously, within one minute of observation. The data is applied to meet Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and national program stated requirements for alerts and warnings when solar flares occur. This data is also applied to forecasts of near-earth space environmental conditions that adversely impact military satellite and surveillance systems, as well as High Frequency (HF) and satellite communications and power grids.
<p>This is a first time buy of these items.The quantity of these items is sufficient since they will only be used to replace failed items while those items are repaired.</p>
<p>This sparing action is expected to last at least 5 years or until another major modification or replacement of the RIMS system.</p>
<p>The specific spares equipment items required are:</p>
<p>Item Part Number Site(s) Qty<br />3415 Gear box 1040414 Palehua 1<br />3425 Gear Box 1040415 Palehua 1<br />3415 Ring Gear Bearing 724616-0001 Palehua 1<br />3425 Ring Gear Bearing 1011911 Palehua 1<br />Interlock Switches 446864 Learmonth/San Vito/Sag Hill/Palehua 8</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Amendment 1 changes the proposals&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DUE date to&nbsp;August 6, 2010, 2pm local time </span>from July 23, 2010.<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Testing of Seat and Restraint Combinations for Use in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.<br /><br /></span>Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have developed an SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. This proposed document has been approved for further development by SAE and is now in its final revision with a vote to approve and accept as final expected this spring. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, a request for proposal was developed and posted in January 2010 to complete this work. A total of four (4) side impact tests will be performed. The resulting dataset will be used to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (proposed). The testing is expected to be conducted in the spring of 2010, with the development of the proposed SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact Testing expected to be completed and approved by SAE in late fall 2010.</p>
<p>The project team is also now completing development of a new AMD standard, "AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST." This newly proposed AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all patient compartment designated seating positions, seat mounting systems, and associated occupant restraints when installed per seat and restraint manufacturer's information. This is expected to be performed as a type test.</p>
<p>The Contractor selected under this Request for Proposal will utilize the testing practices described in the two SAE Recommended Practices described in above, to conduct dynamic testing of Emergency Worker Seating Systems (any unique combination of a seat, seat mounting system, restraint system and seat adjusters which could be used as a designated seating position) in accordance with the proposed AMD Standard 026.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>This contract will evaluate seating and restraint systems, supplied by a variety of seat and restraint manufacturers. Seating systems will be single standalone seats (captain chair), as well as, bench seats, each using a variety of worker restraint types and styles. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Qualify the logic described in the proposed AMD 026 standard for the development of seated and restrained occupant head paths or "stay out zones" during dynamic events.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated the ability of seat and restraint manufacturers to construct a variety of seat and restraint options that allow a belted worker to meet all FMVSS biomechanical limits, as proposed in the draft AMD 026 standard, while undergoing "crash-like" loading defined in each of the SAE Recommended Practices (front and side impacts).</p>
<p>3. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to describe each seat and restraint combination and seat attitude - a function of "stay-out-zone" calculations and Anthropometric Test Device (ATD) response data (biomechanical data) - to perhaps reduce the number of dynamic tests required for the qualification of each seat and restraint combination. Example - does the data indicate AMD 026 should require seat and restraint manufacturers utilize only the higher frontal pulse for all designs regardless of seat attitude with respect to the impact direction?</p>
<p>4. Provide baseline data on current bench seats equipped with both Type 1 and Type 2 belts with wall and seat cushion included.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 14, 2010</span></strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 15, 2010</span></strong>. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions are due June 30, 2010.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Testing of Litter and Patient Restraint Combinations for Use in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.<br /></span><br />Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data.

<p>The project team is also now completing a revision of "AMD STANDARD 004 - Proposed Revision - LITTER RETENTION SYSTEM DYNAMIC TEST". This proposed revision of the AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all litter and patient restraint systems to be installed in an ambulance. This is expected to be performed as a type test once approved.</p>
<p>The Contractor will utilize the testing practices described in the two SAE Recommended Practices described above, to conduct dynamic testing of various combinations of litters, patient restraints, and litter retention hardware in accordance with the proposed revision to AMD Standard 004.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</p>
<p>This contract will dynamically test and evaluate litters, patient restraints, and litter retention hardware, hereafter referred to as "litter systems", as supplied by a several different litter manufacturers, to be identified under a separate solicitation. Litter systems may be mounted longitudinally or laterally, with the longitudinal axis assumed to be the fore/aft axis of the traditional ambulance patient compartment. Likewise, while mounted longitudinally, the litter system may be mounted with either the feet pointed toward hypothetical front of the vehicle or pointed aft as is required in the GSA Star-of-Life Ambulance Purchase Specification today. The overarching goal of this effort is to retain the litter system during crash loading while safely maintaining the patient on the gurney. This would correct two significant issues found during earlier testing.</p>
<p>At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate the ability to manufacture a litter system which will remain attached to the floor in frontal and side crash events as defined in the two SAE Recommended Practice documents.</p>
<p>2. Substantially reduce patient excursions (longitudinally and laterally) without driving biomechanical loading on the patient beyond published limits.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate the ability of litter manufacturers to construct a litter system that can be safely deployed in a side loading ambulance.</p>
<p>4. Validate the testing requirements and methodology described in the proposed revision to AMD 004.</p>
<p>5. Generate patient excursion envelopes for use in design of litter system to vehicle interface.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> on or about <strong>May 14, 2010</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>June 15, 2010</strong>.

<p style="text-align: left;"><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Testing of Seat Restraint and Seat Track System for Use in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.</span></p>
<p>Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have developed an SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. This proposed document has been approved for further development by SAE and is now in its final revision with a vote to approve and accept as final expected this spring. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely not required to meet this standard.</p>
<p>Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, a request for proposal was developed and posted in January 2010 to complete this work. A total of four (4) side impact tests will be performed. The resulting dataset will be used to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (proposed). The testing is expected to be conducted in the spring of 2010, with the development of the proposed SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact Testing expected to be completed and approved by SAE in late fall 2010.</p>
<p>The project team is also now completing development of a new AMD standard, "AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST." This newly proposed AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all patient compartment designated seating positions, seat mounting systems, and associated occupant restraints when installed per seat and restraint manufacturer's information. This is expected to be performed as a type test.<br />While significant improvements in worker safety are expected as a result of these new standards, seating and restraint industry partners have freely acknowledged they have been unable to locate suitable seat and floor tracks to accommodate the unique mobility needs of EMS workers found during patient care activities. Those mobility needs stem from the nature of the work tasks expected of the EMS worker. Specifically, the EMS worker is expected to be able to address patient needs from head to foot. Given the length of the average person when in a supine position on a gurney, this nearly impossible to do while remaining seated and restrained.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first objective is to investigate alternate floor track designs which would allow the worker to remain seated and restrained while accessing the full length of the patient, from head to toe, on a seat that is able to slide on a track along the length of the patient. The second objective of this contracting effort is to identify or design a seat track that will allow the patient to slide closer to or further from the patient while at a fixed location at the patient's side. The seat will need to lock and remain in place whether impact from the front or rear. Once both track systems have been identified, designed, and manufactured, the floor and seat tracks will be dynamically tested to the latest draft standards as part of a validation of both the test standards and the floor and seat track designs.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</p>
<p>The Contract will conduct a market search to identify viable floor and seat track systems for use in ground ambulances to safely increase EMS worker access to the patient. If viable solutions cannot be identified, the Contractor will propose a new design to meet the challenges of this unique environment. Once designed and manufactured, the Contractor will install two or three different seat and restraint system combinations, supplied by commercial vendors as identified under a separate solicitation. Seating systems utilized will be single standalone seats (captain's chair. At the completion of this design and testing program the Contractor will have:</p>
<p>1. Developed a pedestal mounted seat track that can be be positioned in either a forward facing or aft facing orientation while retaining its ability to lock in place in the event of either a frontal or rear impact.</p>
<p>2. Developed a floor track that allows the worker to travel the length of the patient (e.g., 6 ft) in a track that will lock the seat firmly in place and retain the seat and worker with measured biomechanical values falling below limits specified by AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST".</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong>May 13, 2010</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>June 14, 2010</strong>.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.   The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure.  Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide.  Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out.  The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise.  The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform.  In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism.  In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program.  The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012.  Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract.  In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).   In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs.  The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.)   The projected start date is January 2010.  Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas.   &bull;Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States;  &bull;Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities;  &bull;Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises;  &bull;Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials;   &bull;Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives;  &bull;Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance;  &bull;Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs;  &bull;Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms);  &bull;Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems;  &bull;Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure;   &bull;Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads;  &bull;Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders;  &bull;Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities;  &bull;Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations;  &bull;Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.  Establish and verify schedules and performance of transport services as well as establish and maintain key relationships associated with movement of WMD;  &bull;Provide Subject Matter Experts with expertise in the transportation infrastructure of CTR partner countries capable of detailed investigation into tariffs, regulations, certifications, ad hoc support requests or to attend project meetings between government agencies relating to the movement of weapons of WMD and/or associated components;  &bull;Provide ability to establish and manage contract(s) with transportation vehicle maintenance facilitie(s) to conduct and verify maintenance as required to maintain applicable certifications relating to WMD transport vehicles and;  &bull;If authorized, apply CTR resources to the elimination of conventional arms, munitions and their associated infrastructure.

(approx. 7150 SF) and sheathing.  The building is 5 years old and exhibiting moisture related failures of the roof system.  Excessive moisture intrusion combined with insufficient attic ventilation appears to be the cause of the roof system issues.   The current roof system has wings with gable ends and the main part of the building is vaulted roof system.  Work includes furring up the roof, re-sheathing with plywood, enhancing ventilation; re-flashing roof, installing baffled ridge vents, replacing fascia, reroofing with standing seam metal roof and humidistat controlled fans in gable end walls. There also will be a bid alternate for reroofing with composition roofing. Contract performance time is 60 days.  Work will need to be done in phases so building is not exposed to the elements.  The job site is located on the Republic Ranger District compound in Republic, Washington, Ferry County.  Solicitations will be available on or about May 25, 2010.  Engineering point of contact is Lou Janke, Facilities Engineer, Colville National Forest, telephone:  (509) 684-7230.  A site visit is tentatively set for June 8, 2010 at 10 am meeting at the Republic Ranger District Office.   Estimated project value $25,000 to $100,000 NAICS 238160 with size $14.0 mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), intends to award a limited sources contract using the Justification for Limited Sources and Approval procedure to Thermo Electron North America LLC. This contract is for a mass spectrometer subsystem. This contract will include software integration, installation, testing, and maintenance. The institute intends to procure this service contract pursuant to FAR 8.405-6, Limited Sources Justification and Approval. <br /><br />Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received before the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the items listed above and to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 334516/811219 with a size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br />Specifications:<br />The LTD-velos-Orbitrap instrument was acquired in 2009 and is the NIDDK's current "most sensitive" mass spectrometer. Advances in the ion optics in the part of the instrument which first sees the electrospray plume and conveys selected ions into the high vacuum of the instrument make this instrument on the order of 20 times more sensitive than NIDDK's previous (and still operational) "most sensitive" instrument the LTQ-FTultra-ECD/IRMPD. Electron transfer dissociation is similar to electron capture dissociation in that they each involve delivering an electron into a highly charged molecule (although fragmentation will occur for +1 ions charge neutralization occurs for most interesting potential fragments and charge is required for measurement) where it rapidly leads to bond cleavage without any relaxation of the cleavage potential to other parts of the molecule. Such "non-ergodic" fragmentation can be useful in a wide range projects as it provides better sequence coverage than the more sensitive CID methods customarily used for fragmentation and the fragmentation is orthogonal-creating&nbsp;a different kind ion series which acts as an important filter for false positive identifications obtained through CID methods. ECD/ETD when coupled with the CID/HCD fragmentation methods available on the institutes' mass spectrometers is critical for any experimental stance which approaches a problem through a "de novo" approach whether this is done because the actual possibilities are not known or if such a stance reinforces the integrity of the experimental result. This important acquisition will allow us to apply slow electron based dissociation at approximately 20 times the sensitivity as we are able to apply it using the ECD in the detection cell of the FT-ICR mass spectrometer. In addition this upgrade provides improved redundancy in the facility with any one of the instruments potentially able to perform any desired experiment at the threshold created by less sensitive instrument. Through a historical effort to create matched fluidics and instrumentation the instruments could also be more effectively deployed on single extreme priority projects with great effect. <br /><br /><br />POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:Company name, address, phone number, primary contact(s), e-mail address, NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large) and DUNS number.All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 10 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 10 pages, should include references. A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than close of business (4:30 pm local time at designated location) on July 28, 2010 Responses by fax or e-mail WILL BE ACCEPTED. This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received before the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency. <br /><br />The contract vehicle is a Firm Fixed price contract.

This contract is a mass spectrometer subsystem. This contract will include software integration, installation, testing, and maintenance. The institute intends to procure this service contract pursuant to FAR 8.405-6, Limited Sources Justification and Approval. <br /><br />Specification:<br /><br />The Clinical Core Mass Spectrometry laboratory runs all clinical stable isotope studies for NIDDK and collaborating NIH Institutes. We are concurrently working on multiple projects on a single GC-combustion-IRMS system. While the GC-combustion-IRMS is the best instrument for the optimum accuracy and precision of clinical study sample, it is very slow as a method development instrument. The alumina reactors used in the combustion are very fragile and are easily broken during method development. When broken or damaged, these reactors take 1-2 days to replace. The purchase of a GC-quad MS will enable the initial 80% of method development to be performed on a very durable system at the same time making the GC-combustion-IRMS available to run clinical study samples. The GC-squad MS will also expand our core labs capabilities by enabling the identification of peaks in question.<br /><br />The choice will be based on multiple factors including: capabilities, cost and compatibility with the existing GC-combustion-IRMS. The introduction of a newly designed 'ExtractaBrite' source allows the maintenance of the ion source without venting the system, thus minimizing downtime. The system can use multiple ionization sources including electron ionization, positive or negative chemical ionization, and direct sample probe. A new high -speed data acquisition system allows for rapid scanning of up to 11, 111 u/s. A GC-MS would be identical for method development and transferring methods to the GC-combustion-IRMS, thus allowing optimum method development as well as cost savings through the use of the same spare parts for both systems. The selection of a system would also enable grouping service contracts for maximum discounts.<br /><br />Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement.

<DESC>Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) Program
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p><br />Naval Air Warfare Systems, Orlando Training Systems Division, in support of Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) program, intends to issue a contract modification to Columbus Technologies and Services, Inc. (CTS), under contract N61339-05-D-0026, on a sole source basis to one known responsible source who can meet the immediate requirement within an acceptable timeframe until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively. This contract modification will temporarily extend the period of performance (POP) from 31 August 2010 until 31 March 2011. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short-term extension of services. In addition, award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay of work in fulfilling the agency's requirements. An acquisition strategy is simultaneously being developed to define the requirements for a competitive source selection. A Request for Proposals is anticipated to be issued on or about 15 September 2010.</p>
<p>This contract extension will extend the POP ensuring uninterrupted support to the AIM System Support Office (AIMSSO) for the scheduled AIM software release in August 2010, AIM Helpdesk support and AIM User Training, as well as future task orders and this will enable NAWCTSD sufficient time to recompete this requirement. Uninterrupted support to the AIM program and its user community is imperative until the recompete process is completed and transition to the newly awarded contractor occurs. The targeted award date for the recompeted contract is 4/1/2011 with a 30 day mobilization period for transition of software packages. The seven month extension of the POP will allow task orders addressing any emergent requirements to be written and will ensure proper support by the current contracted software team to the user community and AIMSSO. The ability to write task orders through 3/31/11 will also allow for planning a smooth transition to the awarded contractor as software configuration management will be a top priority in order to maintain the integrity of the AIM software code.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. While interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement or submit a proposal, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed and considered by the Government. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the contracting specialist, Christina Garcia, at christina.garcia@navy.mil, or call at (407) 380-4098. Alternate point of contact (POC), Rebeca Gonzalez, at rebeca.gonzalez@navy.mil, or call at 407-380-4524.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 03
Question - We would appreciate clarification on the Evaluation Factor 1 (Specialized Experience) as stated in the Selection Criteria. The statement is made that the Contractor is to provide "a maximum of six (6) projects substantially completed between June 2007 and June 2010."  Given this is a design-services contract, is this statement meant to imply completed designs? Or does is mean physically completed projects? If it does mean physically completed projects, does the term "substantially completed" mean fully useable by the Owner or would some completed portion of the overall project be acceptable (like a certain percentage)?
Answer - Evaluation Factor 1 states "The Contractor shall provide a maximum of six (6) projects substantially completed between June 2007 and June 2010, that best demonstrate specialized experience relevant to the work proposed under this contract; knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices in the contract area; and knowledge of and extent of experience applying sustainability concepts, including low impact development and DoD criteria."  
In this factor the following definitions shall apply:  ."Projects" are defined as design projects."substantially completed" is defined as 80% of the design project has been completed

<a href="mailto:Takashi.Horiuchi@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Japan</a>
<DESC>Synopsis is hereby revised to read as follows.<BR><BR>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION.  AE services are required for multiple Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC).  Each contract will have a maximum amount of $ 2.4 million for the basic contract with four (4) one-year option periods, each option period with a maximum amount of $2.4 million, for a total maximum contract amount of $12.0 million.  Services will be implemented through negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders that may be issued up to the maximum contract amount.  The basic contract period is one year from the contract award date and each option period extends the contract by an additional one-year period. Option periods may be exercised before one year expires if the basic contract or option periods previously awarded have been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  The Government is not obligated to exercise the option periods.  The contract will require the Government to order services priced at not less than two percent (2%) of the stated maximum contract amount for the basic contract, and if exercised, not less than one percent (1%) of the stated maximum contract amount for each of the option periods. Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are anticipated to be issued to qualified firm(s) within eight (8) months after selections are made. The government reserves the right to obtain updates to A-E Firms qualifications prior to issuance of RFP.  THE CONTRACTS WILL BE AWARDED ONLY TO UNITED STATES FIRMS OR TO JOINT VENTURES OF UNITED STATES AND HOST NATION FIRMS.  To be eligible for contract award, United States firms must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/ or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414. Multiple contracts will be awarded for the same services.  Each contractor will be afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order.  The Contracting Officer will consider the following factors when awarding a task order: specialized experience, performance and quality of previously submitted deliverables under the contract, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, equitable distribution of work among IDC holders and other relevant factors. The Government may issue a Letter of Identification to the contractor upon request after issuance of task orders.  The Letter of Identification entitles contractor personnel to enter into Japan to perform work on task orders issued under the contract.   <BR><BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION.  Each Indefinite Delivery Contract requires Architect-Engineer services for U.S. funded design work including repair, maintenance, new construction, planning, engineering studies, site investigations, construction phase services, and other general engineering activities.  It is anticipated that a significant portion of the work awarded under these contracts will be for design of new construction and/or renovation of Department of Defense Education Authority (DODEA) facilities in Japan.  PROJECTS ARE LOCATED ON U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THROUGHOUT JAPAN.  FREQUENT SITE VISITS AS WELL AS MEETINGS IN JAPAN MAY BE REQUIRED.  Design criteria will normally be based on U.S. and DOD requirements; however, design deliverables must address local construction methods and materials that meet the intent of U.S. criteria in order to facilitate the use of local methods and materials.  Work and deliverables may also include feasibility studies, facility assessments, engineering studies, environmental studies, cost analyses, formulation of facility sustainment programs, general investigation and design activities in support of DoDEA and regulatory compliance, surveying and mapping, topographic and boundary surveys, geotechnical services, GIS modeling, CADD/BIM produced plans (AutoDesk Suite of Softwares is required), specifications prepared utilizing Specsintact (Government furnished software), construction cost estimates prepared utilizing Excel Spreadsheets (government furnished), design analysis, weekly status reports, value engineering, submittal and shop drawing review, construction management support, and school standards development and maintenance using BIM. Design considerations may include master planning, landscaping, architectural evaluations, hardware, electronic and communications systems, AT/FP compliance, coordination for ordnance and/or explosives investigations, environmental and EPA regulatory considerations for storm water and site drainage pollution prevention plans, AHERA asbestos abatement, and construction site requirements. Electronic files are required to be provided on CD or DVD. Materials and sites to be investigated may contain Asbestos, Lead Based Paint, CFC's, PCB's, Radiological Waste, UST's, OE, or any other related HTRW/Environmental Material on potentially contaminated sites. Some work may require attending public meetings, and coordinating with Federal, State, and Local regulatory agencies.<BR><BR>3. SELECTION CRITERIA.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) awarded 5 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts under the  Prevention Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM-TAC) solicitation. The successful offerors for  these contract  awards were, HHSA-290-2010-00005I, American Institute for Research (A.I.R);  HHSA-290-2010-00004I, Abt Associates;  HHSA-290-2010-00001I, Booz Allen Hamilton; HHSA-290-2010-00003I, Research Triangle Institute (RTI); and HHSA-290-2010-00002I, Westat.  These contracts were awarded to   support AHRQ’s Prevention/Care Management Portfolio in its work to build evidence and facilitate improvements in primary care, clinical preventive services, and care of chronic conditions related to:  1) clinical decision making; and 2) the application of primary care transformation principles, including care coordination, patient activation/self management support, the integration of health information technology in support of the goals of the Portfolio, and linkages between clinical practices and community-based/public health interventions for prevention and care of chronic conditions.  

This project was competed on a cost reimbursement basis. There are many uncertainties involved in contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES<br />CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION<br />FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION<br />RELATIVE TO USE OF A LABOR HOUR CONTRACT<br />(IAW FAR 16.601(c))<br />RFP 2008-N-10241
<p>FINDINGS:</p>
<p>I. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), have a requirement for Management Consultants and Technical Assistance from the MASO Office.</p>
<p>A. Because the nature of the work for management consultants and technical assistance involves varied labor categories and support, it is not possible to project with certainty how long it will take to perform the required services and associated tasks. For this reason a fixed price contract is not a suitable contract type. The work is also not susceptible to a cost reimbursement contract for the same reason - the extent of support is not sufficiently definable to allow negotiation of an estimated cost and associated fixed fee.<br /><br />B. With respect to the Government surveillance for labor efficiency, CDC and ATSDR technical personnel are sufficiently familiar with the work to be able to judge how much time will be required for the various services and associated tasks. Also, the types of services required are of an on-going nature, where labor efficiency is of lesser importance than where the labor is geared toward delivery of an end product. There are no materials to be supplied by the contractor, and therefore effective cost control in the purchase of materials is not an issue in this procurement.<br /><br />C. Although there are no materials being supplied by the contract, reimbursement of other direct costs for items such as travel or employee training may be authorized from time to time.</p>
<p>I HEREBY DETERMINE THAT:</p>
<p>On the basis of the above finding of facts, no other contract type except the fixed price, labor hour contract is suitable for the acquisition of services as described above.</p>
<p>______/S/___________<br />Sandra D. Mack <br />Contracting Officer</p>

This action is a fixed-price contract to Wyle Laboratories, Inc.entitled Low Boom Community Response. The Supersonics Project is aligned with theAeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) principles of maintaining intellectualstewardship of aeronautical core competencies for the nation in supersonic flighttechnologies and research appropriate to NASAs unique capabilities.  The Projectsupports the Fundamental Aeronautics Program strategy of developing systems levelmultidisciplinary capabilities (e.g., airframe design, engine design, airspace modelingand simulation) for supersonic civilian and military applications.  The SupersonicsProject is a broad-based effort designed to develop knowledge, capabilities andtechnologies that support vehicles that fly supersonic by eliminating the efficiency,environmental and performance barriers to practical supersonic cruise vehicles. TheProject has identified a set of key Technical Challenges that are barriers to success forthis vehicle type.  The efforts described in this award address the Sonic Boom ModelingTechnical Challenge.In this effort, the Contractor shall design and execute an experiment to gather datarelating the impact to community residents resulting from sonic boom exposure consistingof multiple low-boom events generated by existing aircraft.  The Contractor shall acquiredata of sufficient quantity and quality to enable a thorough evaluation of the surveymethods used, data acquired, and analysis methods employed.  The effectiveness of thetest methodology for community response testing shall be demonstrated.	The Contractorshall identify and address issues related to conducting future experiments with a navecommunity not previously subjected to sonic booms, including the identification ofstrategies to minimize transient/adaptation effects associated with the introduction of anew noise source to a community.Components of the experimental design that shall be addressed include: noise exposure(levels and numbers of sonic booms), number of participants and their selection, subjectquestionnaire design, and data acquisition methods (both acoustical and meteorological).Questionnaire design shall enable comparisons to be made with results from previous sonicboom and community noise surveys. The questionnaire shall be pre-tested before the flighttests begin, and survey methodologies shall be developed in sufficient detail to providethe material necessary to secure OMB approval for data collection from the general publicin future experiments.	The Base Period ARRA funded portion of this effort is $298,702and there is also an additional 12 month Option Period for $415,791 to be funded withNon-ARRA funds if exercised.

The new generator shall be adequately sized to serve fire safety and critical operation systems. Remove the automatic transfer switch (ATS) that are no longer in use and evaluate the existing main switch gear to determine if it can be reused or needs to be replaced.  The emergency power system (generators, switchboard, and transfer switches) shall be modified to incorporate only one emergency generator and one emergency power circuit to feed egressligheing, vcertain mechanical loads (to be determined) to preserve the building in the event of an extended power outage, fire alarm and security panels, the emergency room, and the server room, the laboratory, and immunizations. No other loads are authoized and the generator and transfer equipment shall be sized to meet the required loads. Remove all unused equipment and raceways. The government intends to ship the existing generators to other bases.  As an option, prepare the two existing generators for shipment to other military bases.  Another alternate price will be proposed to reuse one of the existing 500kW generators, although we do not recommend this option because of the age of the existing generator and because the existing generator would be significantly underloaded during actual outages.

<AWDNBR>FA4600-10-F-6U06
<ARCHDATE>08132010
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY (FAR 6.303 2(a)(1))<br />a. The agency is HQ Air Force Weather Agency/A8P, Offutt AFB, NE.<br />b. The contracting activity is 55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE.<br />2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED (FAR 6.303 2(a)(2))<br />A. Due to the circumstances described below, this Justification and Approval ("J&amp;A") authorizes use of other than full and open competition procedures to procure extended warranties for 32 DigiCORA&reg; MW-31 Upper Air Sounding Systems from Vaisala, Inc. ("Vaisala") to support the Air Force Weather Agency ("AFWA").<br />B. This J&amp;A is initiated because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The resulting contract is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This new procurement is to satisfy genuine needs of AFWA. The period of performance will start on the date of award and will continue for one year.<br />3. SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE) (FAR 6.303 2(a)(3))<br />A. This requirement is for the purchase of extended warranties for 32 DigiCORA&reg; MW-31 Upper Air Sounding Systems ("MW-31"). The MW-31 consists of a dual channel precise positioning system/standard positioning system ("PPS")/("SPS") wind finding GPS receiver (crypto key capable), deployable laptop computer (which includes the Windows&reg; operating system), MW31 METGRAPH Color Graphics Analysis Program, and the CG31 Portable Antenna. This hardware and software system is packaged together to provide upper air profiles for deployed weather forces world-wide. Since the equipment is located at austere locations, classified in most cases, the contractor will not be required to travel to the specific location to repair the unit. The warranty support ensures return to service support via telephone support 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year. If the unit is determined inoperable, the unit will be returned to the vendor for repair as appropriate.<br />4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY (FAR 6.303 2(a)(4))<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />5. THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (FAR 6.303 2(a)(5))<br />Due to Vaisala's hardware and software proprietary rights, no other source can fulfill this requirement. The MW-31 was designed and built by Vaisala. The system processor does not contain any line replaceable units ("LRUs" are components that can be removed and replaced). The MW-31 is an all inclusive unit with no removable parts. The MW-31's hardware and software are all proprietary. Vaisala performs all MW-31 maintenance and support in-house and does not have any external relationships with other vendors to perform service on the MW-31.<br />6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE (FAR 6.303 2(a)(6))<br />Current research and past experience have shown that extended warranties for the MW-31 are available exclusively through Vaisala. On 5 May 2010 a Sources Sought was posted to FedBizOpps in an effort to determine what other sources are available to fulfill this requirement. On 12 May 2010 the Sources Sought closed and Vaisala was the only vendor to submit a response. Furthermore, for the FY09 requirement in April 2009 a Request for Quote was sent to 13 vendors via GSA e-Buy. However, Vaisala was the only vendor who responded by submitting a quote.<br />7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST (FAR 6.303 2(a)(7))<br />This item will be purchased commercially. Price reasonableness will be based on acquisition history for same and similar items and analysis of pricing information provided by Vaisala.<br />8. MARKET SURVEY (FAR 6.303 2(a)(8))<br />On 5 May 2010 a Sources Sought was posted to FedBizOpps in an effort to determine if there are any other sources available to fulfill this requirement. On 12 May 2010 the Sources Sought closed and Vaisala was the only vendor to respond.<br />9. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 6.303 2(a)(9))<br />No vendors other than Vaisala responded to a Sources Sought posted to FedBizOpps with regard to this requirement. Vaisala is the only source for this support due to its proprietary rights over the hardware and software associated with this equipment.<br />10. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED A WRITTEN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION (FAR 6.303 2(a)(10))<br />No other sources have expressed written interest in this acquisition. Vaisala is the only known source which can fulfill this requirement.<br />11. ACTIONS, IF ANY, THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TO REMOVE AND OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED (FAR 6.303 2(a)(11))<br />Presently no other sources have expressed interest in fulfilling this requirement. For future acquisitions of this service, a Sources Sought will be posted to FedBizOpps in an effort to determine whether or not there are other sources available which can fulfill this requirement.<br />12. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12))<br />The approval signature on the Justification Review Document is evidence that he has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.<br />13. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.303 2(b))<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Justification Review Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.

Subject:  Sterile Processing Microsystem (SPM) Technical Support Upgrade (TSU) Justification & Approval


JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:	

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303,  justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 5     
849 International Drive, Suite 275
Linthicum, MD 21090

2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:   This justification and approval is for the award of a sole source contract to Materials Management Microsystems (Contractor) to provide continued Technical Support Upgrade (TSU) maintenance service on its proprietary Sterile Processing Microsystem (SPM) instrument tracking software.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  

Contractor shall provide continued maintenance service on its proprietary SPM instrument tracking software at Baltimore and Washington VA Medical Centers. Instrument tracking software allows each medical center to more efficiently track the cleaning and use of sterilized supplies and equipment. This service is required for continuity of business function.

Maintenance service would be provided from date of award to September 30, 2010.

Services include unlimited telephone customer service assistance, upgrade to software, and access to the password-protected Materials Management Microsystems website. The total contract value is $7,480.
4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY: The requirement will be procured under citation 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(1): Only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

The requirement is essential to continue Contractor maintenance of its proprietary SPM instrument tracking software at Baltimore and Washington VA Medical Centers.

Continuation and maintenance of this service is vital to ensure proper tracking of sterile supplies. Staff at Baltimore and Washington VA Medical Centers have been trained extensively in the use of this proprietary SPD software to track cleaning and use of sterilized equipment and supplies. To have to solicit entirely new software and software licenses would result in disruptions to ongoing services and at additional expenses and staff training time for the Government.

The required software license and maintenance services are only available to the Government from Materials Management Microsystems, as their software is proprietary. No other contractor can satisfy VISN 5 requirements for this service.

If VISN 5 and the VA Medical Centers in Baltimore and Washington chose not to have continued maintenance service on the SPM software, it would not receive updates, improved capabilities, and computer bug fixes for the software already acquired. This would result in significant disruption to patient services.

6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  

The contractor was the only source identified, since it has proprietary rights on its software and only the Contractor can provide such maintenance service on its software.

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  VISN 5 has reviewed and determined that the total contract value of $7,480 is fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  Market research was not conducted, since it was determined that only the Contractor could provide continued maintenance services on its proprietary SPM software.

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  N/A

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN:  It is anticipated that the Government will do a competitive acquisition for sterile tracking software over the long term if such a need arises due to the medical centers and VISN 5 needing to have a new, enhanced software package to address significant changes to the processes used in tracking sterilized equipment and supplies.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
