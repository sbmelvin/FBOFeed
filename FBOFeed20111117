Additionally, the F-16 ATS provides the capability to generate targets from information received from the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) network. Support under this procurement may include software and hardware upgrades that would affect the Eglin DTF F-16 ATS datalink testing capability, to include upgrades or enhancements to the DIS software to achieve higher levels of fidelity or actual F-16 Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates, which is the F-16 aircraft software required to run the ATS. The physical installation of any software or hardware upgrades at the Eglin DTF may also be necessary. The contractor must have a prior and detailed working knowledge of the unique equipment and software involved. This must include knowledge in (1) design and operation of the DTF F-16 ATS hardware and software, (2) the interface between the ATS models and the F-16 OFPs, and (3) the modeling software and its interfaces with the Eglin DTF ATS hardware. LM Aero is the only known company that has the detailed knowledge and expertise to meet the Government's requirements. A requirements contract is anticipated with firm-fixed price, fixed price incentive fee, cost plus incentive fee, cost plus fixed fee, time and material, and other contract types potentially being utilized during the course of this contract. It is estimated that the total period of performance will not exceed five years from the time of award. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.&nbsp; The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Computer Packages, Inc for commercial items.&nbsp; This contract provides payment of patent maintenance and annuity fees for the patent protection of inventions of the NIH and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees in the United States and foreign countries.&nbsp; This sole source is to prevent a lapse in service for approximately a six (6) month period (estimated December 17, 2011 through June 16, 2012) during the acquisition planning, negotiation, and award of the Full and Open competitive requirement under Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIHOD2011289 for the Payment of Patent Maintenance and Annuity Fees, which will be posted on or about December 6, 2011.&nbsp; The Full and Open competitive requirement will be awarded for a base period of one-year with four (4) one-year option periods.&nbsp; This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the six (6) month period while completing the acquisition process for the competitive requirement under RFP No. NIHOD2011289 are ongoing.&nbsp; Only the current Contractor is uniquely qualified to perform the services required within the six (6) month period. Based on the complexity and level of detail involved in the payment of patent maintenance and annuity fees, it is not feasible for a new Contractor to assume responsibility for such a brief period of time and meet the deadlines for paying the maintenance and annuity fees for the United States and foreign countries.&nbsp; The current Contractor, Computer Packages, Inc. has already undertaken on behalf of the Government the tracking of cases in order to maintain the patents in the United States and foreign countries and would continue to provide the service.&nbsp; The United States and each foreign country have different requirements, timeframes, and fees to pay. Failure to follow the appropriate steps will cause the U.S. Government to lose intellectual property rights in the United States and the foreign countries. Such a loss has a serious and direct effect on the Government.
<p>As noted above, this is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.&nbsp; However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.&nbsp; The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements of the Statement of Work and the terms and conditions of the current contract.&nbsp; Capability statements and related materials must be received by Sheryn N. Etti, Contracting Officer, no later than November 28, 2011, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; Written responses received after November 28, 2011, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time will not be accepted.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. &nbsp;Address responses to the attention of Sheryn N. Etti at the National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions via email at ettis@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a follow-up announcement to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00019-12-R-0001.
<p><strong>DRAFT PWS:<br /></strong>The Government intends to post a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and associated DRAFT documents for industry's review and feedback on or about 01 December 2011.</p>
<p>The Government is receptive to ideas to reduce constraining requirements, reduce risks, reduce costs, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award. The Government intends to implement a Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) to measure Contractor performance. The measures align with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Performance, and Sustainment. A performance incentive is likely to be associated with performance that exceeds contractual minimum requirements, measured by the PMF. Once the PMF is available in DRAFT form, the Government will solicit comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.<br /><br />The Government invites written industry feedback as noted above in the form of recommendations and/or questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 04 January 2012; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals. Contractors are directed NOT to present or provide proprietary information. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned.

<p><strong>GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY ONE-ON-ONE's:<br /></strong>In addition to the requested written feedback, following the Industry Day conference, the Government invites interested companies to privately present meaningful feedback in-person. Please be mindful that the one-on-one sessions are not intended for Q&amp;A dialogue between the Government and Industry. They are offered for Industry to share recommendations and/or concerns regarding the upcoming competition as a preface to the written feedback due by 04 January 2011. The Government does not intend to discuss any portion of the acquisition strategy during the one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p><strong>One-on-One sessions will be scheduled between 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 14 December 2011, and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 15 December 2011.</strong> The amount of time alloted to each company will be approximately one hour, but ultimately dependant on the number of companies scheduled.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent The MIL Corporation of 4000 Mitchellville Road, Bowie, MD 20716-3177 for 50,967 hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel and Materials under contract N00421-09-C-0096 for the continuance of integrations and engineering services to meet the requirements for development, integration, and procurement support of mission systems integration for airborne and shipboard platforms in support of the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division, through the Mission Systems Engineering Branch (AIR-4.5.10.3) while the follow-on contract is being completed. This acquisition covers an extended period of performance of approximately four months that will run from 16 January 2012 to 15 May 2012. This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling 15 January 2012. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0096 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, The MIL Corporation is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor (The MIL Corporation) currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Resolicitation for the four month period would not only result in a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Kristen Wahl, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, via email: kristen.wahl@navy.mil.
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The MIL Corporation is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competitition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<CONTACT>Margaret Tse, Phone 202 254-6950, Fax 202 254-8600, Email margaret.tse@dhs.gov - Tisha W Blue, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6751, Email tisha.blue@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>This is a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) as well as a draft Request for Proposal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) anticipates soliciting proposals to procure Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) support for the BioWatch Systems Program Office (SPO) for the DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA).</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice includes a draft solicitation (see attachments). Any questions about the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing by Monday, December 5, 2011 at 3:30PM Eastern Time to Margaret.Tse@dhs.gov. An Industry Day is anticipated and the estimated date is Wednesday, December 14, 2011; however, the time and location is to be determined. Further information will be posted as an amendment at a later time.<br /><br />The anticipated acquisition strategy for this requirement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 514690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 million. The contract type is anticipated to be a hybrid with part of it being a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) type contract; therefore, the offeror must have an approved cost accounting system. <br />In addition, contract performance must take place at offices located in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the offeror must have a secret facility clearance.</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements are encouraged. In accordance with FAR 19.101(7) if the anticipated value of a contract exceeds one-half the size standard for a NAICS that carries a revenue based size standard, then for purposes of determining small business status the applicable size standard applies to individual concerns (businesses), not to the combined assets of a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement.<br /><br />The NAICS code (541690) applicable to the small business set aside portion of the BioWatch SETA is a revenue based size standard ($7.0M) and the anticipated value of the contract is in excess of one-half the size standard.<br />Accordingly, if a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement is formed for purposes of responding to the small business set aside portion of the BioWatch SETA, then the size standard will be applied to the individual businesses, not to the combined assets of the Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement. That means that a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement between an Other than Small Business (large business) and small business is impermissible, and that in order for the Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement to be considered small *ALL members of the Joint Venture or Team MUST BE small businesses.* Additionally, even if not part of a small business Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement, a large business cannot be affiliated with a small business. If affiliation is found, small business size standards cannot be met. Business concerns are affiliates of each other if one has the potential to control the other.<br /><br />The limitations on forming Small Business Joint Ventures or Teaming Arrangements do not extend to subcontracts with large businesses. A Small Business Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement entity may subcontract with large businesses subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, and retain its status as a small business.</p>
<p>Additional information on small business Joint Ventures is accessible at the following links:<br />http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqindex.cfm?areaID=15<br />http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/faq/index.html<br /><br />The anticipated official solicitation issuance date is unknown. DHS makes no representation that a final solicitation will be issued or that a contract award will result from the solicitation (when issued).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is an 8(a) competitive, Design-Build acquisition which will result in an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC). Task orders issued under this SATOC can require performance at military installations anywhere in the contiguous United States (CONUS) and may require work outside the contiguous United States (OCONUS). The life of the basic contract is for a base period of one (1) year, with one (1), one-year option period or $49M; whichever occurs first. The Government will use a best value, trade-off evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders shall range between $750K and $7M. Task orders issued under this SATOC will be firm-fixed price.<br><br>Description of Work: Task Orders placed under this SATOC will be Design-Build. Our customer, the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), provides sustainment, repair and modernization support to facility physical plant and infrastructure systems that are installed in Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) worldwide.  MTFs are responsible for providing health care to Air Force, DoD, DoD retired and military dependents.  The building physical plant can best be defined as any and all major building system(s) that provide a safe, comfortable interior environment that is conducive to healing.  Typically, there are three predominant infrastructure systems which comprise the building physical plant and they are the Building Envelope, the Mechanical Infrastructure and the Electrical Infrastructure.  The Building Envelope includes sub-systems such as roofs, windows, exterior walls and the entire exterior building envelope which provides a barrier and shields the interior spaces from the infiltration of water, contaminated and/or unconditioned air.  The Mechanical Infrastructure Systems includes systems which condition, produce, distribute and control the air; process water, potable water and waste water; fire suppression and specialized distributed medical systems within the facility.  These systems include but are not limited to the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems typically comprised of boilers, chillers, pumps, compressors, pneumatic and electronic control systems, refrigeration systems, sanitary sewer, medical air/gas production and regulation, vacuum and medical waste systems.  The Electrical Infrastructure system provides for the safe and reliable generation, regulation, transformation, distribution of critical electrical power throughout the facility, as well as provides for clear audio/visual communication of fire and emergency egress systems.  These systems typically include medium and low voltage dry-type and oil filled transformers, service entrance switchgear and large power circuit breakers, diesel driven electrical power generators, emergency power transfer switches, main power switchboards, bus ducts, feeder and branch circuit wiring systems; emergency and general interior/exterior lighting systems; fire alarm panels, heat/smoke detection systems, fire alarm initiation devices, fire alarm bells and audio/visual notification systems, public address/notification systems, nurse call systems; lightning protection systems, electrical grounding systems; and exit/egress pathway marker lighting systems. The AFMS has 73 medical campuses around the world ranging from very large medical trauma centers to small clinics and veterinary offices.  These facilities also range in age from new construction to buildings originally constructed circa 1950 and older.   Even though properly operated and maintained, through the natural aging process over the life of the facilities, the physical plant and major infrastructure systems deteriorate and eventually fall to a state of disrepair. When this happens, the facility physical plant is no longer capable of meeting minimum performance levels required to maintain a safe healing environment for the patients and staff. Through continuing facility condition assessments, the AFMS Engineering Branch, working with the local Medical Group Facility Management teams, identify systems which are in need of performance life extension, repair, restoration and/or modernization in order to continue to support the total physical plant performance charter and the medical mission.<br><br>Interested firms should be capable, and prepared, to perform numerous task orders, at various CONUS and/or OCONUS geographic locations, simultaneously. <br><br>The Government will use a trade-off evaluation process in determining the best value. Offerors will be required to submit technical proposals in conjunction with a price proposal. The evaluation factors include - Qualifications and Experience of the Team; Management Approach; Risk Mitigation; and Past Performance. All non-cost factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.<br><br>A pre-proposal site visit will be conducted for the "seed project" on or around 14 December 2011 at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Details concerning the pre-proposal site visit will be provided in the solicitation.<br> <br>The approximate issue date of the solicitation is 8 December 2011. The solicitation will be available for download from FedBizOpps (FBO) only - no paper copies will be made available. The proposal due date is on or about 20 January 2012, 2:00pm (Central Time). Downloading project documents requires registration at the FBO website - http://www.fbo.gov. Amendments will be made available from FBO by download only - no paper copies will be made available. Further details will be issued with the solicitation. This announcement serves as the advanced notice for this project.<br><br><br>

<DESC>B-52 Weapons System Trainer (WST) Follow-on Request for Information (RFI)<br />Solicitation Number: FA8621-12-R-6265 17 November 2011
<p>I. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes<br />a) This is an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.<br />b) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide installation of upgrade kits on the B-52 Weapons System Trainers (WST).<br />c) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the FAR. Companies responding to this RFI are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<br />d) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />e) Background: The B-52 WST trainers have undergone an aggressive development period comprised of several parallel projects. These projects include the B-52 Software Block 3 (BSB03) update, Defense Station Subsystem re-host, Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) interface hardware, audio system replacement, and visual and radar system upgrade. These projects were initially developed on the WST System Integration Lab (SIL) where they were validated and accepted. The consolidation of these projects was then installed as a prototype kit on WST7 at Barksdale AFB, where the current software baseline has been accepted. Two other complete kits were made for WST1 at Minot AFB and WST6 at Barksdale AFB and reside at those bases. The WST6 kit also includes components and software for the two Offensive System Mission Trainers (OSMT); OSMT H1 and OSMT H2.<br />f) All services will be housed in Government facilities.<br />g) Payment for installation services under this contract will commence with the start of service at each site.<br />h) The purpose of this solicitation is to determine offeror interest in providing B-52 WST kit installation services to the United States Air Force (USAF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements<br />a) The contractor will be required to install the WST kits (hardware/software) on WST1 and WST6, and kits on OSMT H1 and H2. The WST1 kit includes hardware components for the Flight Station (FSS), Offense Station (OSS), and Defense Station (DSS). The WST6 kit is identical to the WST1 kit except the additional kit installs for the both the OSMTs. A technical data package (i.e. level II drawing, to/from wire list) will be provided. Installation will not be in the form of a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO).<br />b) The contractor will be required to install the Visual System Upgrade. The efforts defined in the Visual System installation will include the following:<br />1) Image Generator (IG) Replacement. The efforts associated with replacement of the existing EPX-500 IG with the new EPX-5000/50 IG shall include disconnecting the related cabling and removing the single bay EPX-500 IG cabinet in the computer room and installing the new double bay EPX-5000/50 IG cabinet in its place. The existing video cables from the IG cabinet to the new Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) projectors shall also be replaced with new fiber optic video cables from the IG cabinet to the new LCoS projectors on the trainer projector platform. This installation shall also include replacing the existing EPX-500 visual operator console monitor, mouse and keyboard with the new monitor, mouse and keyboard provided with the EPX-5000/50 IG.<br />2) Visual Projector Replacement. The existing three Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) projectors and their related electronic equipment shall be removed from the projector platform. Five new LCoS projectors and their related support frames shall be installed onto the existing projector platform. Additional support structure shall also be added to the projector platform support frame which shall require removal and reinstallation of the projector platform floor plates.<br />3) Light Tight Enclosure Replacement. The existing light tight enclosure surrounding the three CRT projectors shall be replaced with a new light tight enclosure surrounding the five LCoS projectors.<br />4) SEOS Mirror Bowl Aft Wall Upper Wing Panel Replacement. The visual installation shall include replacement of the mirror bowl aft wall wing panels. The new upper wing panels shall provide a wider opening for the projector ray trace. Replacement of the upper wing panels shall also require the removal of the mirror bowl and Back Projection Screen (BPS). The mirror bowl and BPS shall be removed and then re-installed after the upper wing panels are replaced. In the event that the Mylar mirror is damaged during the mirror bowl removal or re-installation process, the Mylar mirror shall be replaced at contractor's expense. The navigator slide projector used for mirror bowl alignment and acceptance shall be relocated from its present location to a new location on the projector platform because its present location will interfere with the projector ray trace.<br />5) Mirror Bowl UPS Installation. An Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) shall be installed to allow for operation of the mirror bowl vacuum pump during short periods of facility AC power loss. The UPS shall be installed in the cockpit lighting power supply cabinet (1A9). The existing filler panel at the top of the cabinet shall be removed and replaced with a pair of filler panels; one below and one above the UPS.<br />6) AC Power Cabinet Modification. The new visual projection and IG system hardware shall derive its AC power from the existing WST power cabinet (Unit 11). The IG requires the installation of a second 30 Amp three phase 120 volt circuit breaker to support the second bay cabinet. In addition, the necessary modifications shall be made to the power cabinet to support power to the five LCoS projectors and the mirror bowl vacuum pump UPS.<br />7) CRT Projector Alignment &amp; Video Distribution Equipment Replacement. The current CRT projectors on the WST utilize equipment installed in the Co-Pilot's I/O cabinet (1A34), to include an Alignment PC, video and power distribution equipment. The CRT related equipment shall be replaced with the LCoS projector related equipment to include a new alignment PC, and power distribution equipment. The existing CRT related ODYSSEY handset that is used to perform diagnostics and alignment on the CRT projectors shall be replaced by a new laptop computer. The laptop shall be installed in the cabinet. The existing Odyssey handset interface connector panel on the side of the Co-Pilot's I/O cabinet shall be replaced with an equivalent interface connector panel to support the new laptop.<br />8) Radar Simulation System (RSS) Replacement. The existing RSS capability shall coexist with the new RSS. The RSS World Wide Database (WWDB) shall be installed on the new RSS. The additional RSS computer shall share a common WWDB with the Flight Station and Targeting Pod IGs. <br />9) Removal of STV IG. The Steerable Television (STV) system is no longer being supported on the B-52H aircraft; therefore the STV IG shall be removed. The related equipment, to include the Real Time processor (RT), Graphics Processor (GP) and External Effects Generator (EXG) shall be completely removed from the Flight Station IG. The equipment shall be retained as spares. The STV channel RT and GP in the targeting pod IG shall be retained and reconfigured as the Radar Terrain Server (RTS). The STV channel EXG shall be removed and modified from a single channel to a dual channel EXG for use as a spare. The related STV channel unique video distribution cabling shall be removed as well between the IGs and cabinets 75 and 77.<br />c) The contractor will be required to replace the existing ASTi Digital Audio Communications Systems (DACS) with the ASTi Telestra systems which are located in the Instructor Operating Station (IOS) stations (FSS, OSS, DSS, and OSMT). The cabling to the new Remote Interface Units (ACE-RIUs) shall involve running Ethernet cables and adding an Audio Distribution Ethernet (ACENet) switch between the Telestra Target computer and the ACE-RIUs. New +15V DC Power Supplies shall be added to power the ACE-RIUs.<br />d) The contractor will be required to install the new DMO related pieces of hardware/software into the existing WST suite to facilitate the implementation of the new DMO capabilities to the Mission Package 2008 (MP08) standard. The DMO kit hardware includes, but is not limited to, a network switch, a maintenance laptop, keyboard, video and mouse switch, GPS receiver with antenna, and a network traffic manager computer. The IOS shall be modified with the new hardware configuration to integrate the brief/debrief system. The DMO software baseline shall be installed as part of the overall WST combined software baseline.<br />e) The contractor will be required to upgrade the DSS with WST kit hardware and software. The DSS modifications include the following:<br />1) Replace the legacy I/O controller with VMIC I/O system<br />2) Replace the Micro 3 mainframe and interface cabinets with the SI interface VME chassis<br />3) Replace the existing signal generation hardware with the new SIGGEN system<br />4) Replace the audio and aural systems<br />5) Update the Offensive Instructor Station (OIS)<br />6) Install the NGTS Computer Generated Forces (CGF)<br />7) Install the DSS software baseline as part of the WST software baseline installation<br />8) Install other miscellaneous hardware contained in the DSS portion of the WST kit<br />f) All systems included in the WST and OSMT kits shall require installation and configuration of updated BSB03 compatible software and have their related cold start procedures performed during Hardware/Software Integration (HSI). <br />g) The contractor will be required to upgrade the Radar Simulation System (RSS) to include the Radar Terrain Server (RTS).<br />h) The contractor will be required to verify and validate each requirement through testing in independent, mixed, integrated, and joint mode.

<DESC>HAZMAT CLEAN-UP SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>Introduction<br />The Air Force has a potential requirement for a five (5) year Blanket Purchase Agreement beginning 18 December 2011 and ending 17 December 2016 for Hazardous Material/Blood Borne Pathogen Cleanup. No solicitation is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. As a result of accidents, mishaps, and medical emergencies at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, spills of blood and other potentially infectious body fluids have occurred in both indoor and outdoor locations around the Base. These spills of potentially infectious materials need to be expeditiously cleaned up to avoid risk of exposure to other base personnel and spread of materials to other areas.</p>
<p>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WP AFB) is located in southwestern Ohio, east of the city of Dayton, and adjacent to the City of Fairborn. It is situated approximately 60 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio, and 50 Miles west of Columbus, Ohio. The base encompasses nearly 8,200 acres and occupies portions of Greene and Montgomery counties, and is adjacent to Clark County. The base is divided into four areas - Areas A, B, C, and Kittyhawk. Area A is primarily comprised of building complexes. Area B contains a complex of buildings and three runways that are no longer utilized for flying, except occasionally for the Air Force Museum. Area C is primarily comprised of runways and flight facilities. The Kittyhawk area is comprised of entertainment and support facilities for base employees. Areas A and C are separated from Area B by State Route 444 and Conrail railroad tracks. Kittyhawk is separated from Area C by State Route 444. In addition to the defined, fenced in areas of the base, there is also property off base, which is primarily housing facilities.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein.
<p>This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 118 each "F-15 Valve, Solenoids" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the F-15. The F-15 Valve, Solenoids are considered highly specialized because they are precision valves that incorporate both mechanical and electrical systems. The dimensional tolerances are very tight and need to be precise for this valve to work with the next higher assembly, the shimmy damper. The integration of electrical controls corresponding to the mechanical valve control requires months, if not years of testing, to ensure the correct function of the valve. To qualify a valve not manufactured from Parker Hannifin would require multiple test stand type tests, fit checks, flight testing (which includes steering capabilities) and multiple aircraft for testing. Parker Hannifin has the engineering expertise for this valve and it would take years and millions of dollars to qualify multiple manufacturers. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the F-15 Valve, Solenoid it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Parker Hannifin's own expense. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.</p>

<DESC>Hispanic Community Health Study  Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL)
Coordinating Center RFP Number NHLBI-HV-13-05
Small Business Sources Sought Notice


The Division of Cardiovascular Sciences of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Coordinating Center of the program entitled Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL).  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made in April 2013 for a period of six years.  
The HCHS-SOL began in 2006 in four U.S. communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami, FL). Approximately 16,000 Hispanic/Latino men and women between 18 and 74 years of age were recruited between 2008 and 2011 across communities. A baseline examination (Visit 1) was performed during that period of time.

The objectives of the renewal of the HCHS-SOL program are to 1) further investigate the apparent paradox of high socioeconomic adversity, substantial cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD) risk factor burden, and low CVPD prevalence and mortality in Hispanics; 2) identify putative causes for diseases and conditions highly prevalent in Hispanics (e.g. diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), left ventricular hypertrophy, and gestational diabetes mellitus); 3) describe the  transformation of health-related risk and protective factors related to migration, acculturation, and length of time living in the U.S.; 4)  assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, cultural values, risk behaviors, and medical care access on health in Hispanics; and 5) investigate genetic effects, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions in relation to measured phenotypes in this uniquely admixed population. These objectives will be accomplished through annual follow-up and a second examination (Visit 2) of the existing cohort.

NHLBI plans to support one (1) Research Coordinating center, four (4) Field Centers, and one (1) Echocardiography Reading Center.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE COORDINATING CENTER ONLY. 
The Field Centers and the Echocardiography Reading Center shall be supported by a Coordinating Center which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. 
The important overall technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the HCHS-SOL include the following:

  Demonstrated ability to lead, coordinate, and participate in all aspects of planning of Visit 2 components of HCHS-SOL;

  Establish and finalize subcontracts with an Electrocardiogram (ECG) Reading Center, Pulmonary Reading Center, Neurocognitive Reading Center and a Central Laboratory;

  Establish and finalize working agreements with the Echocardiography Reading Center associated with HCHS-SOL;

  Establish data entry systems to collect measures from the Visit 2 as specified in the protocol;

  Monitor recruitment of participants and completion of Visit 2 interviews and procedures;

  Provide central training and certifications of cohort follow-up interviewers, medical record acquisition staff, medical record abstractors and physician reviewers;

  Identify an ECG Reading Center that will oversee the acquisition and reading of ECGs on all HCHS-SOL cohort participants; a Pulmonary Reading Center that will oversee the training, acquisition, quality assurance, and quality control of the spirometry measurements in all HCHS-SOL participants; a Neurocognitive Reading Center that will oversee  the acquisition and reading of neurocognitive tests performed by HCHS-SOL participants ages 45 years and older (approximately 3,000 per Field Center) that had these tests done at Visit 1; and a Central Laboratory that will oversee the training for the venipuncture, acquisition, process, aliquoting, and shipping of blood, serum, plasma and urine samples, and laboratory analyses;  

  Provide statistical analyses appropriate to epidemiology studies with complex designs; and

  Provide a plan for transition of responsibilities, data and materials from the existing Coordinating Center to the new Offeror.

Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks as articulated above are invited to submit capability statements.  

The capability statements shall include:  (1) professional qualifications of scientific, managerial and technical personnel including medical, technical, statistical, computer, and administrative staff with relevant expertise in epidemiologic research; (2) the organizational flexibility to modify the labor mix to meet the changing demand on the resource; (3) evidence of prior administrative and scientific leadership as a multi-center epidemiology study coordinating center managing a study of this size (approximately 16,000 participants); (4) evidence of leadership in first-authoring and publishing scientific papers in a collaborative study; (5) experience and expertise in design, implementation and maintenance of quality control procedures including assessment of reproducibility, validity, and bias and drift in laboratory measurements in large multi-center studies; (6) substantial experience pertinent to the development of protocols and management of a wide variety of large-scale multi-center epidemiology studies; (7) experience and expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular and lung diseases; (8) expertise to determine appropriate levels for participant alerts and referrals, and actions required for participant safety; (9) experience in generation and enhancement of applications of appropriate statistical methods of analysis and interpretation of medical data; (10) access to a large capacity computer facility and networking to remote terminals, and experience in installing and maintaining such networks; (11) capability to subcontract to laboratories and reading centers; and (12) the firms status as a small business under NAICS Code 541712. Evaluation of the capability statements shall be based on the technical capabilities listed above. Each technical point (criterion) shall be weighted equally.  

Capability statements submitted in response to this notice that do not provide sufficient information for review will not be considered. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should NOT include budgetary information. The Government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of six years with an approximate award date of April 01, 2013.  Firms responding to this notice shall provide capability statements (original and three copies) no later than 04:00 pm EST on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

Your submission shall include the name and telephone number of a point of contact.  Please reference this notice number. Electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted and shall be sent to Michael White, Contract Specialist (email address:  michael.white2@nhlbi.nih.gov) and Tara Knox, Contracting Officer (email address:  tara.knox@nhlbi.nih.gov).

<DESC>Hispanic Community Health Study  Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL)
Echocardiography Reading Center RFP Number NHLBI-HV-13-07
Small Business Sources Sought Notice

The Division of Cardiovascular Sciences of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Echocardiographic Reading Center as part of the renewal of the program entitled Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL).  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made in April 2013 for a period of six years.  

The HCHS-SOL began in 2006 in four U.S. communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami, FL). Approximately 16,000 Hispanic/Latino men and women between 18 and 74 years of age were recruited between 2008 and 2011 across communities. A baseline examination (Visit 1) was performed during that period of time.

The objectives of the renewal of the HCHS-SOL program are to 1) further investigate the apparent paradox of high socioeconomic adversity, substantial cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD) risk factor burden, and low CVPD prevalence and mortality in Hispanics; 2) identify putative causes for diseases and conditions highly prevalent in Hispanics (e.g. diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), left ventricular hypertrophy, and gestational diabetes mellitus); 3) describe the  transformation of health-related risk and protective factors related to migration, acculturation, and length of time living in the U.S.; 4)  assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, cultural values, risk behaviors, and medical care access on health in Hispanics; and 5) investigate genetic effects, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions in relation to measured phenotypes in this uniquely admixed population. These objectives will be accomplished through annual follow-up and a second examination (Visit 2) of the existing cohort. 

NHLBI plans to support one (1) Research Coordinating center, four (4) Field Centers, and one (1) Echocardiography Reading Center.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY READING CENTER ONLY.

The Field Centers and the Echocardiography Reading Center shall be supported by a Coordinating Center which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The Echocardiography Reading Center shall work cooperatively with other study centers, including the four Field Centers, the Coordinating Center and other Reading Centers, and the NHLBI Project Office in all relevant aspects of study development and execution. 

An echocardiogram will be performed on cohort participants who are 45 years of age or older at the time of Visit 2 (approximately 3,200 per Field Center or 10,000 total).  The specific study protocol and echocardiographic parameters will be defined by the Echocardiography Reading Center.  

The technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos include the following:

  Propose and determine structural and functional parameters for the echocardiography measurements from Visit 2; 

  Develop the Visit 2 protocol for performing the echocardiography examination; 

  Train and certify Field Centers echocardiography technicians, train and certify echocardiography readers at the Echocardiography Reading Center;

  Perform readings and information abstractions of echocardiography measurements obtained during Visit 2;

  Track the receipt, reading and storage of the echocardiography images received from the Field Centers in an electronic database; at the end of the contract period plan for the long-term storage of the archived echocardiography images; and 

  Participate in the analysis and interpretation and publications of the echocardiography data. 

  Based on the Visit 2 protocol, develop the criteria for urgent findings and alerts, and report them accordingly to the Field Centers and the Coordinating Center.

The capability statement shall include: (1) the professional qualifications of scientific and technical personnel in accordance with the above requirements; (2) demonstrate capacity of individuals and the institutional support to perform the function of an Echocardiography Reading Center for a multi-center collaborative epidemiology study, including protocol development, operational and scientific coordination, information processing and coding; facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software to read echocardiograms and capability of transferring data between Field Centers and the Echocardiography Reading Center, and between the Echocardiography Reading Center and the Coordinating Center; (3) evidence of ability to integrate potential advance in echocardiography imaging technology into study protocol; (4) evidence of ability to assess and monitor quality control for obtaining and reading echocardiograms;  (5) evidence of ability to manage data, including tracking of all Echocardiography Reading Center activities;  (6) evidence of ability to analyze data from longitudinal epidemiologic studies, and publish results in peer reviewed journals; and (7) the small business status of the firm under NAICS Code 541712.  Evaluation of the capability statements shall be based on the technical capabilities listed above. Each technical point (criterion) shall be weighted equally.

Capability statements submitted in response to this notice that do not provide sufficient information for review will not be considered. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should NOT include budgetary information. The Government intends to negotiate one contract for the period of six years with an approximate award date of April 01, 2013.  Firms responding to this notice shall provide capability statements (original and three copies) no later than 04:00 pm EST on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

Your submission shall include the name and telephone number of a point of contact. Please reference this notice number. Electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted and shall be sent to Michael White, Contract Specialist (email address:  michael.white2@nhlbi.nih.gov) and Tara Knox, Contracting Officer (email address:  tara.knox@nhlbi.nih.gov).

The main sewer interceptor extends approximately 1,850 feet from an inlet in an existing ditch.<br>  <br>The sewer interceptor will begin at a culvert type inlet at the existing ditch, with a berm to create the design headwater depth.  Approximately 800-feet of an existing storm drain will require removal while maintaining adequate storm water collection.  The sewer interceptor consists of approximately 1,850-feet of 72-inch and 78-inch RCP from the upstream inlet to the first inlet.<br><br>Approximately 650 feet of 48-inch RCP lateral system will connect a large drainage inlet (in five streets) to reach the sewer interceptor. <br><br>Many utility relocations are required including but not limited to an 8-inch sanitary sewer, a 15-inch sanitary sewer, a 4-inch water line, and several large electrical transmission poles.  Because of the frequency of rail traffic, jacking of the sewer interceptor is required under the main tracks of the Railroad.  Pressure manholes and conduits are necessary due to the hydraulic grade line profile and the pressure head that was analyzed in the system. <br><br>Because the construction will be along active residential streets and cross a Boulevard, traffic control of at least two lanes will have to be maintained to provide access to local residences and businesses including trash pickup, school bus access, and driveway access.<br><br>This Sources Sought Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for the Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) for the HC-130H aircraft.
<p>This is NOT a request for proposals. This is a request for information only and no contract will be awarded based on responses to this announcement.</p>
<p>The USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) is seeking information from businesses that can provide the Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit (DFDAU) for the upgrade of the existing Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) software on the HC-130H utilizing technologies offered by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Teledyne Controls, Cage Code 98571, 501 Continental Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Flight Safety Office has outfitted the HC-130H and HU-25 aircraft with a Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit (DFDAU). The DFDAU is a device that captures and processes various aircraft parameter information such as discrete, digital and analog data. This data is then output in a single data stream to the Voice/Flight Data Recorder (VFDR). The HC-130H will be undergoing, in 2012, an Avionics First Phase Upgrade (A1U) that will remove a significant number of the existing aircraft systems that are supplying data to the DFDAU. These aircraft systems will be replaced with newer, more efficient and information abundant systems. As a result of these changes, the current FDAU software for the HC-130H will no longer work on those modified aircraft. Therefore, the FDAU will require a software modification that will add a configuration for the HC-130H modified with A1U.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED: The USCG is seeking information from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) that can provide the aircraft parameter configuration for the HC-130H equipped with a Teledyne DFDAU. This configuration will reside alongside the existing two configurations without corrupting either. Since the HC-130H is undergoing an Avionics upgrade, a number of reporting systems will be replaced. To capture these new systems, a new aircraft parameter configuration is required and loaded into the existing DFDAU.</p>
<p>Nomenclature: Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit <br />Part Numbers: P/N: 2233000-936<br />Original Equipment Manufacturer: Teledyne Controls, Cage Code 98571<br />Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), cage code and CCR small business self certification for NAIC 334511 along with product information for Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit which will allow the USCG to understand your full capabilities.<br />Please respond to the following questions: <br />(1) Is your business a large or small business? <br />(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? <br />(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? <br />(4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? <br />(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? <br />(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? <br />(7) Are your services listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using your overhaul facility, and if so which agencies, provide point of contacts and contract numbers.<br />All companies that can meet the specifications are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, and/or any other information that demonstrates that the specifications can be met. Responses to this sources sought notice along with any capability statements, company literature, brochures shall be emailed to: Theresa Alkeus Theresa.L.Alkeus@uscg.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than 05 December 2011 at 3:00 p.m. EST.</p>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research, and identifying potential sources and best practice information towards designing, developing, and procuring a Modular Armor System. The system will allow the individual Marine to configure and tailor the armor level based on mission requirements. 

 The United States Marine Corps (USMC) envisions at this time a single system that will be capable of providing the area of coverage of the current USMC Plate Carrier and expanding to a soft armor area of coverage equal to the USMC Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV) with the Pelvic Protective System Protective Overgarment (POG). The system will be able to provide supplemental armor protection to the extremities.
  The envisioned system will either integrate with current hard armor ballistic plates or a new hard armor plate design.  There are no constraints on symmetry or materiel for soft and hard armor. Hard Armor threat defeat capability equal to that of the XSAPI is required with a desired maximum allowable areal density of 7.0 pounds per square foot. The soft armor performance within the torso and extremity regions is required to possess performance equal to the OTV CO-PD-00-2G with a desired maximum allowable areal density of .85 pounds per square foot.  The carrier will possess the Pouch Attachment Ladder System (PALS) webbing for the mounting of modular pouches, have a single pull emergency release located on the center of the vest below the neckline and integrate with the USMC Chest Rig without impeding the quick release of the carrier.
 The desired system will not exceed the cumulative weight of the IMTV with torso and flank plates.  This suite will enable the individual Marine to configure components to best meet specific mission requirements by optimizing/balancing human factors engineering (e.g. comfort and usability), integration with fielded Load Carriage Equipment (LCE) and cost (production and maintenance).  

Berry Amendment compliance will apply to any and all demonstrated designs. A limited quantity (i.e. up to 30) of evaluation systems may be requested under a bailment agreement to support user evaluation activities based on market research results. No user evaluations are planned prior to June 2012.

The USMC is currently performing market research to learn applicable/proven best practices (note: the Modular Armor Systems attributes have not yet been finalized).
  Within that effort, the USMC wants to leverage its expertise in USMC operational needs and related constraints with industries established expertise and capabilities to design and develop best value solutions.  Therefore, the USMC is taking the following market research step and  requesting information from interested companies on: (1) best approaches to satisfy the above needs with a completely new, innovative solution, (2) reviewing industry capabilities to satisfy the above needs with an updated solution that includes reuse of in-service components (i.e. plates, soft armor) of fielded system. 

Interested parties shall furnish the Program Management Office (PMO) with written or electronic materials concerning their capability to address the above requirements.
  Any proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI will be appropriately protected when clearly identified as proprietary. Submitted material will not be returned. Submissions shall NOT contain any classified information, but may be marked Company Proprietary. These responses should be received not later than December 30, 2011 by sending it to Huy Nguyen, at email address huy.nguyen@usmc.mil. Note: All transmitted responses must be smaller than 5mb. In addition to written responses, the PMO will have representatives attending the 2012 Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show and will be available on January 17, 2012 from 8:00 am  4:00 pm and January 19, 2012 from 8:00 am  12:00 pm.
  A separate FEDBIZOPS notice will be posted by December 1, 2011 with instructions on how interested parties can request that PMO representatives visit their booth for up to thirty (30) minutes to review any available samples of armor carriage solutions that address this RFIs requirements. Visit requests can be arranged by emailing the POC identified below.  Any/all questions regarding this request should be addressed to Huy Nguyen at email address huy.nguyen@usmc.mil.  Due to resource demands, time is limited and requests will be fulfilled on a first come, first serve basis. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.
 NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT COSTS OR CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI AND GOVERNMENT USE OF SUCH INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC><br />United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to award a sole source contract to JDI Enterprises located in Browntown, WI, to provide a Panel Manager for the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. <br /><br />The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP) was authorized in the 2008 Food, Conservation, and Energy Act. Through this program, funds would be available to support training, education, outreach, and technical assistance initiatives for beginning farmers or ranchers in fiscal year 2012. In accordance with the authorizing legislation, Priority will be given to partnerships and collaborations led by or including nongovernmental and community-based organizations with expertise in new agricultural producer training and outreach.
<p>This sole source purchase order for the FY 2012 Panel Manager is being issued to JDI Enterprises for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Has the technical expertise to provide a qualified Panel Manager.</p>
<p>2. Has authored several books on entrepreneurship and sustainable development.</p>
<p>3. Has been involved with BFRDP from its inception and had attendance at the 1st stakeholder workshop to provide input in developing the program and has provided a review panelist in FY 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>4. Has prior experience as Panel Manager for BFRDP, and performance was outstanding. .</p>
<p>5. Used their vast connections with farmers, Community Based Organizations (CBO) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) to help select a very diversified panel as recommended by the stakeholders and required by the legislation. More than 50% of the panelists were beginning farmers and/or representatives of CBOs and NGOs. More than 53% were minorities and 57% were females. It would not have been possible for NIFA to recruit such a diversified panel; as we do not have that many qualified panelists in our reviewer data base, without them.</p>
<p>6. Helped to mentor the new panelists by participating in their training and by calling and working with them and also helped to manage the panels and select the best proposals for funding.</p>
<p>7. Has a long history and credibility working with CBOs and the sustainable agricultural community. A large majority of the stakeholders, applicants and grantees are from Community Based Organizations, (CBO) and the sustainable agriculture community.</p>

<DESC>The Mission Installation and Contracting Command-Fort Gordon (MICC) intends to issue a sole-source, firm fixed price, purchase order to Promega Corporation for a quantity of one hundred and ten (110) each Plextor HY System, DNA 800 rxn kits and, thirteen (13) each of Plextor Calibration Kits, to conduct DNA analysis in criminal investigations. Promega Corporation holds the patent on Promega Corporation DNA quantization and is the only company that is authorized to market the requested Promega Corporation DNA quantization kits. The research and validation of these particular kits also proved that they served the best in low level DNA accuracy, which is paramount when conducting DNA analysis in criminal investigations. Other kits failed to achieve this level of accuracy required.  Using any other kit would result in a lengthy validation phase, changing software on our instruments, and creating an unnecessary backlog in criminal cases submitted for examination. This would hamper the entire judicial process. DNA's case work is about 75% sexual assault related and has interest at the highest levels within DoD and Congress.  These kits are required to support United States Criminal Investigation Laboratory. <br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<p>Contracts GS09T07DLD8002 and GS09T07DLD8003 were awarded to Hawaiian Telcom and tw telecom respectively on November 21, 2006, and are due to expire on November 20, 2011. Both firms provide telecommunications services under GSA orders to Federal agencies at various locations in the State of Hawaii. Therefore, both firms are the only sources capable of continuing these services until follow-on contracts are awarded and services transitioned to these contracts. Ensuring continuity of services mitigates the risks of any major disruption, loss of functionality and/or features, degradation of services, and significant overall cost impacts to end users. The bridge contracts will encompass approximately 1,250 Centrex lines and 25 circuits for a base period of six months, plus a six-month option.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SamKnows LTD, 25 Harley St, London, GBR for continued data collection, testing and verification services necessary to ensure that the FCC continues to have access to accurate broadband measurement and testing data. A contract was competitively awarded in April 2010 to SamKnows to obtain measurement and test data using software and hardware proprietary to SamKnows. It's "white box" hardware containing the proprietary software subsequently was deployed to approximately 9,000 sample panelists who were selected to participate in the study based, in critical part, on statistically relevant selection criteria proprietary to SamKnows and whose identity is known only to SamKnows. A subsequent six month sole source contract was awarded to SamKnows on May 3, 2011 to continue this work. The FCC issued a Report describing the results of the study in August 2011. <br /><br />The FCC requires an additional one year contract to enable further data collection, analysis, and the preparation of a 2012 study, with a one year option to include, if necessary, the preparation of a 2013 study report. Continued access to accurate broadband performance measurement data can only be achieved through the use of the technology and panel participants currently in place. Maintaining the integrity of this approach to data collection and analysis will enable the FCC to develop time series assessments of changes in the panel's broadband use over different periods. It also will avoid the introduction of new methodologies that could compromise the policy value of the data gathered in the studies. Another vendor would not be able to replicate the measurement study using the same proprietary processes and existing panel participants, thereby compromising the integrity of the collection process and the compatibility of the data for purposes of comparative studies, projections, etc. SamKnows is the only source for collecting, analyzing and providing this data with the existing deployed hardware and software to the same group of approximately 9000 panelists. <br /><br />The FCC is not soliciting quotes from other parties and this notice is for informational purposes only. If you believe you can do this follow on work as detailed in the attached statement of work consistent with all aspects of section C, please submit your capabilities by the closing date of this announcement. Responses may be emailed to the contracting officer prior to the closing date.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Contracting and Acquisition Management Office (CAMO), in support of the DoD CNTPO, awarded five prime contracts to provide the necessary goods and services required by DoD CNTPO to support CN/CNT missions of DoD, OGAs, partner nations and State and local authorities.  These contracts were omnibus type arrangements, under which the prime contractors were required to satisfy the entire scope of work.  The ordering date for these contracts ends 23 August 2012.  The following attachments are provided in this annoucement:<br>ATTACHMENT 1- Current Scope of Work<br>ATTACHMENT 2- Training<br>ATTACHMENT 3- Operations and Logistics <br>ATTACHMENT 4- Program Support<br>ATTACHMENT 5- Command, Control, Communications, Information, Detection & Monitoring (C3IDM).<br> <br>The purpose of this announcement is to advise prospective prime contractors that the Government intends to execute a follow-on procurement.  For purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to gain information regarding the capabilities, capacity and qualifications of interested prime contractors. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED BASED UPON INFORMATION GAINED FROM THIS INFORMATION EXCHANGE SESSION.  The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy, there is no solicitation, and there is no other information available at this time.  Other than information provided herein, no other information is available, and no other responses or inquiries will be accepted.  <br><br>OVERVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS:<br><br>This acquisition is for critical services and procurements in support of the Department of Defense Counter Narco-Terrorism Program Office mission to disrupt, deter, and defeat the threat to national security posed by illicit trafficking in drugs, small arms and explosives, precursor chemicals, people, and illicitly-gained and laundered money. Support shall be provided in the following major functional areas: Training; Operations and Logistics; Program Support; and Command, Control, Communications, Information, Detection & Monitoring (C3IDM).  Within these broad functional services definitions, are requirements for operations & logistics, minor construction, and provision of materials and end-items.  Notional scopes of work for each of these functional areas is provided as Attachments 2 through 5 respectively.  <br><br>Type of Contract:  The Government contemplates the execution of each functional area as a MAIDIQ arrangement.  Up to four awards are contemplated under each functional area.  The Government contemplates the establishment of pricing matrices from which the price for task orders will be based.  Maximum labor rates, maximum indirect rates and maximum profit/rates will be included in the pricing matrices.  The type of task order will be established at the task order level and will be based upon the nature and complexity of the instant requirements.  It is contemplated that firm, fixed price (FFP), cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF), fixed price with reimbursable travel and Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance and hybrids thereof will be employed.  The term of each MAIDIQ will be a five-year ordering period, commencing on or about 1 June 2012.  <br><br>Estimated MAIDIQ ceiling:  A shared ceiling will be established for each functional area MAIDIQ.  The value of that ceiling is TBD at this time.<br><br><br><br>Contemplated NAICS Codes: <br> <br>Training - NAICS 611430, size standard $7M<br>Operations and Logistics - NAICS 561990, size standard $7M<br>Program Support - NAICS 561990, size standard $7M<br>Command, Control, Communications, Information, Detection & Monitoring (C3IDM) - <br>NAICS 541330, size standard $27M  <br><br>Inherent in the execution of these scope of work are the following.  This information is preliminary and further information/details will be provided in a published Request for Proposals (RFP).<br><br>1.	The Contractor will be required to provide these goods and services at CONUS and OCONUS locations and must plan accordingly, to include but not be limited to insurance, security, ITAR, export compliance, shipping and logistics.  These requirements are worldwide; however, the primary regional areas of interest include Central and Western Asia, Sub-Sahara Africa, and Central and South America.  <br>2.	The Contractor must consider the requirements for delivering goods and services to remote and austere locations worldwide.   <br>3.	Support may be required either as temporary duty (TDY) non-local travel or on-site support at destinations, which include both CONUS and OCONUS locations, to include possible deployment to theaters of operations/war zones. Personnel arming requirements are possible.  <br>4.	Certain contractor personnel will be required to possess TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) CLEARANCE and/or be eligible for immediate adjudication by the cognizant security authority upon award of the contract.  Future requirements for SCI-eligible personnel will be identified in individual task orders.  The contractor shall have or be able to obtain a Top Secret "Facility Clearance" and shall possess "Safeguarding Capabilities."  Some task orders issued under this contract may require access to, and clearance for, Special Access Programs (SAPs) up to and including the TOP SECRET/SCI level.  Some task orders will require access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  The contractor shall perform in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22M) and ensure that all classified material is handled in accordance with the latest appropriate security classification specifications.  For task orders requiring TS/SCI clearance, foreign participation will not be allowed at the prime or subcontract level.<br>5.	Performance of this anticipated effort will be subject to Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) provisions (see FAR Subpart 9.5) at the prime and task order level.  <br>Firms performing directly or indirectly in a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant capacity on any program funded or managed by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>), or programs funded or managed in conjunction with  U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)  may be precluded from participation in this contemplated acquisition, dependent upon whether actual or perceived conflicts of interest can be mitigated.  Furthermore, any awardee under this contemplated acquisition that provides support under an individual task order to a system or program managed by USASMDC/ARSTRAT or other associated air, space, and missile defense organizations, may be precluded from participating as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant on future acquisitions directly or indirectly involving that system or program.<br>6.	Contractors will be required to comply with ITAR requirements and will be required to export information and material to OCONUS locations.  <br><br>CNTPO ORGANIZATION AND MISSION<br><br>CNTPO is an acquisition program office working directly in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counter Narcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>).  The mission of CNTPO is to provide acquisition support to the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, State and local authorities, and partner nation agencies to disrupt, deter, and defeat the threat to national security posed by illicit trafficking in all its manifestations:  drugs, small arms and explosives, precursor chemicals, people, and illicitly-gained and laundered money.<br><br>Working primarily with the Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC), CNTPO performs technical and program management activities as required to convert requirements into contract actions and to ensure Government oversight is maintained throughout the performance of all activities associated with this acquisition. The associated end user community includes agencies such as, but not limited to:  (a) the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force South; (b) U.S. drug law enforcement agencies (including the Drug Enforcement Administration & U.S. Customs and Border Protection); and (c) Department of State (including the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs); and (d) individual partner nation agencies with law enforcement authorities.<br><br>The activities of the DASD-CN> span across the full spectrum of response to the illicit exchange continuum.  Since terrorist and militant organizations can easily tap into the transnational illicit marketplace (predominated by illicit drug proceeds) to underwrite their activities and acquire arms and other supplies to conduct insurgent operations, CNTPO must be able to respond to a wide range of acquisition requirements throughout the world and that extend beyond traditional DoD acquisition and contracting scopes. <br><br>Due to the rapid adaptability of the counter narco-terrorist threat, special federal Government spending authorities are available to the DASD-CN>.  Due to political and operational considerations, projects and requirements are usually determined and must be responded to quickly.   For existing goods and services, a typical timeline of 60-90 days from requirements identification to award is expected, with accelerated awards possible.  <br><br>INFORMATION REQUESTED: <br><br>If you believe your firm possesses the technical capability, financial, facility, equipment and personnel resources, and relevant experience/past performance to perform the type of work specified above as a prime contractor, please submit the following information.  Responses to this request shall be limited to 30 pages or less, excluding coversheets and/or table of contents, and must be received by 4:00 pm (CST), 15 August 2011.

Hardcopy submissions shall consist of one original and three copies, and shall be forwarded to USASMDC/ARSTRAT, ATTN:  SMDC-RDC-AA/Patricia Ashley, Bldg 5224/Room 1-E-412, Huntsville, AL  35898.  Electronic submission shall be sent to patricia.c.ashley@smdc.army.mil.<br><br>Again, this announcement is being used solely to gather market research information. This is not a request for proposals nor will technical capability statements be considered a proposal. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.<br><br><br>1.

Identify the percentage of work that you, as a prime contractor, are capable of performing in each major technical function for which you are capable.  If you are a small business or joint venture of small businesses under the above NAICS codes, discuss how your firm will meet the requirements that at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime contractor.  <br>9.

Emphasis shall be placed on your past experiences with large task/delivery order acquisitions in a competitive, multiple-award environment and which involved the management of a large pool of subcontractors/team members.  Each experience provided (Government or commercial) shall include the following information: (a) name of project, (b) brief description of project, (c) contract or project number, (d) contract type, (e) client/customer point of contact (name, address, phone number, e-mail address), (f) dollar/ceiling value of the contract/project, (g) period of performance of the contract/project, (h) relevance of contract/project to requirements of this anticipated effort, (i) total number and magnitude of task orders (dollar value, duration, etc) awarded to you under the contract; and (j) total number (delineated by business size) of subcontractors/team members managed by you under the contract.<br>11.

Address each system and/or program separately and provide your planned approach for mitigating any conflicts.  If no real or potential conflicts exist, so state.<br><br>If your anticipated participation will be that of a small business joint-venture, you must identify each joint venture participant.  If participation will be that of a newly formed small business joint venture, provide the information required above for each participant in the joint venture.<br> If you are a small business, and if the Government were to set this (or any portion of this) acquisition aside for small business (either as a 100% set aside or a partial set aside), you would be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).

Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime.  The prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of 'ostensible subcontractor' as set forth in 13 CFR 212.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(H)(3).

OVERVIEW INFORMATION
Agency Name: U.S. Army Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Centers (ARDEC) Benet Laboratories (BL)
Issuing Acquisition Office: U.S. Army Contracting Command (USACC)  New Jersey, Benet Laboratories Contracting Center (BLCC), Watervliet, NY
Research Opportunity Title: Basic and Applied Scientific Research for Metal Direct Digital Manufacturing for Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF) Program 
Research Opportunity Number: W15QKN-12-R-D008
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number and Title: 12.431  Basic Scientific Research
Announcement Type and Date: Initial Announcement  November 2011
I.   RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION
BL together with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is soliciting proposals for manufacturing technologies related to Metal Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) that address defense (Aviation, Maritime, Land and Troop Support Supply Chains) industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. 
The vision for the IBIF Program is to continue to make investments in manufacturing research that address defense industrial base shortfalls, especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. The objective is to ensure that the industrial base on which the Department of Defense (DoD) depends is reliable, cost-effective, and responsive to DoD requirements. The IBIF program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors as they relate to the defense industrial base.
The IBIF program is focusing on the transition of technology to the defense industrial base for systems in acquisition or sustainment.  It is not to focus on future systems.  The emphasis is on improving surge capability for near-term military operations and in areas that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material.
Area of Interest: 
The technology thrusts of interest are related to Metal (DDM). At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies; however, each offeror must identify a target implementation for the proposed technology. Proposals without a clearly identified target implementation of value to this area of interest in the BAA will not be considered for award. A target implementation must be expressed in terms of research on materials or processes for improved weapon systems, for example: F-22 repairs, MRAP component life extension technology, or armor system materials development.  Processes should initially target low risk replacement parts and noncritical structural components and should be developed in consideration of future scale-up to production of larger more complex components and repair in mind.  Areas of interest include those that have a wide ranging impact to all services, to acquisition and depot part repair.
All (DDM) processes and systems are eligible for consideration.  , Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Electron Beam Melting, Laser Engineered Net Shape, Selective Laser Sintering and Semi-Solid Freeform Fabrication.  Related to those areas, specific issues to consider include:
improving as deposited surface finishimproving deposition rates and overall part throughputprocess monitoring and control for powder and laser processesoptimization tools with respect to material usage, geometry, build rate, and directionality of properties with respect to the build directionfunctionally graded materials
The aforementioned technologies are representative examples of the types of processes under consideration for this BAA.  Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals related to these and similar technology areas.   II.   AWARD INFORMATION
Awards made under this BAA may be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and Other Transactions and are subject to the availability of appropriations.  Proposals should be written to include a base period of one year plus two one-year option periods.  Projects must have clear goals for each year.  Funding of the option years will be contingent upon satisfactory performance of the base period and the availability of funds.  Most proposals will request funding in the range of $200,000.00 to $1,000,000.00 per year.  Multiple awards under the BAA are anticipated.
Offerors submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Contracting, Agreements, or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.
Amendments to this BAA shall be posted to the web sites located in Section IV of the BAA when they occur.  Interested parties are encouraged to periodically check these websites for updates and amendments.
Types of Awards:The Government has the authority to award a variety of instruments and reserves the right to use the type of instrument most appropriate for the effort proposed. Offerors should familiarize themselves with these instrument types and the applicable regulations before submitting a proposal. Following are brief descriptions of the possible award instruments.
1. 	Contracts (Research & Development): A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, reflects a relationship between the Federal Government and a State, a local government, or other recipient when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government. The primary purpose of contracted R&D programs is to advance scientific and technical knowledge and apply that knowledge to the extent necessary to achieve agency and national goals. Unlike contracts for supplies and services, most R&D contracts are directed toward objectives for which the work or methods cannot be precisely described in advance.  
2.	Grant  A legal instrument that, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6304, is used to enter into a relationship:
a. 	The principal purpose of which is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law or the United States, rather than to acquire property or services for the DoD's direct benefit or use.
b. 	In which substantial involvement is not expected between the DOD and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the grant.
c. 	No fee or profit is allowed for research entities.
3. 	Cooperative Agreement  A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition "grant"), except that substantial involvement is expected between the DoD and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The term does not include "cooperative research and development agreements" as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a. No fee or profit is allowed for research entities.
Grants and cooperative agreements are governed by the following regulations:a. 	OMB Circular A-21, "Cost Principles for Educational Institutions"b. 	OMB Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments"c. 	OMB Circular A-102, "Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments"d. 	OMB Circular A-110, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations"e. 	OMB Circular A-122, "Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations"f. 	OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations"g. 	DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs), DoD 3210.6-R
Copies of OMB regulations may be obtained from:Executive Office of the President Telephone: (202) 395-7332Publications Service FAX Requests: (202) 395-9068New Executive Office Building http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/grants 725 17th Street, N.W., Room 2200 Washington, DC 20503
An electronic copy of the DODGARs may be found at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/32106r.htm
NOTE: In accordance with DOD Directive 3210.6, the DODGARs may include rules that apply to other nonprocurement instruments, when specifically required in order to implement a statute, Executive Order, or Government wide rule that applies to other nonprocurement instruments, as well as to grants and cooperative agreements.  
4. 	Other Transactions:
a.	Other Transaction for Research and/or Technology Investment Agreement (TIA)  A legal instrument, consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2371 and/or 10 U.S.C. 2358, which may be used when the use of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate for basic, applied, and advanced research projects.  The research covered under another transaction shall not be duplicative of research being conducted under an existing DoD program.  To the maximum extent practicable, other transactions for research/TIA shall provide for a 50/50 cost share between the government (as research conducted generally transitions into readily marketable technologies with the offeror seeing a near term return on investment (ROI)). No fee or profit is allowed on other transactions for research/TIAs for research entities.
b.	Other Transaction for Prototype Projects  A legal instrument, consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2371 (as supplemented by Section 845 of Public Law 104-201 and Section 804 of Public Law 104-201), which may be used when the use of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate for prototype projects directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the DoD.
Other Transactions for Prototype Projects are acquisition instruments that generally are not subject to the federal laws and regulations governing procurement contracts.  As such, they are not required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), its supplements, or laws that are limited in applicability to procurement contracts.  
In accordance with statute, this authority may be used only when:  
(1) There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent in the prototype project; or 
(2) No nontraditional defense contractor is participating to a significant extent in the prototype project, but at least one of the following circumstances exists:  
(i) At least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by the parties to the transaction other than the federal government.
(ii) The senior procurement executive for the agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible or appropriate under a procurement contract.  
As defined at 37 CFR 401.2(a), the intellectual property provisions of an Other Transaction can be negotiated to provide expanded protection to an offeror's intellectual property. An offeror's cost share may take the form of cash, independent research and development (IR&D), foregone intellectual property rights, equipment, or access to unique facilities, as well as others.  The effort covered under an Other Transaction shall not be duplicative of effort being conducted under an existing DoD program.III.   ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION
A. 	Eligible Applicants:  Proposals may be submitted by but not limited to, single researchers, degree-granting universities, nonprofit organizations, or industrial concerns. Proposals are encouraged from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (as determined by the Secretary of Education to meet requirements of Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C.  1061)) and from Minority Institutions defined as institutions whose enrollment of a single minority or a combination of minoritiesexceeds 50 percent of the total enrollment. [20 U.S.C.  1067k(3) and 10 U.S.C.  2323(a)(1)(C)].
In accordance with federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense and Army policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the Army.
Subcontracting:Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(d)], it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors under all contracts awarded to prime Contractors.
B. 	Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number andCentral Contractor Registration (CCR):Prospective offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award. Verify the accuracy of your Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) registration at the D&B websitehttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform before registering with the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov. The CCR obtains Legal Business Name, Doing Business Name (DBA), Physical Address, and Postal Code/ Zip+4 data fields from D&B: If corrections are required, registrants will not be able to enter/modify these fields in CCR; they will be pre-populated using D&B Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) record data. When D&B confirms the correction has been made, the registrant must then re-visit ccr.gov and 'accept' D&B's changes. Only at this point will the D&B data be accepted into the CCR record. Allow two (2) business days for D&B to send the modified data to CCR.
C. 	Cost Sharing or Matching: To the maximum extent practicable (a minimum of 10% cost share is anticipated), the offeror will include cost sharing, matching, in-kind contributions and/or cost participation.  Additionally, for research & development that will most likely result in the development of readily marketable technologies it is anticipated that cost share will be provided in the offerors proposal.  Note: Cost share may be a requirement for award of an Other Transaction (to include Other Transactions for Prototype Agreements (10 USC 2371  845) & Technology Investment Agreements (10 USC 2358 and/or 10 USC 2371)).
Unsuccessful Proposal Disposition: Unless noted in an offeror's proposal to the contrary, unsuccessful proposals will be retained for six (6) months and then properly destroyed.IV.

The estimated project costs must be shown in total as well as broken down to show cost elements for each year of the program. The budget justification should provide additional data (not included in Sections A through J) by element of cost, sufficient to meet the guidance provided below and ensure meaningful evaluation. 
Salary Costs (Sections A and B) - For all employees/labor categories, indicate the amount of time being charged to the proposed project and show resulting costs based on current or projected salary and fringe benefits. Show the current and projected salary amounts in terms of man-hours, man-months, or annual salary to be charged by the principal investigator(s), faculty, research associates, postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students, secretarial, clerical, and other technical personnel either by personnel or position. State the number of man-hours used to calculate a man-month or man-year. For proposals from universities, research during the academic term is deemed part of regular academic duties, not an extra function for which additional compensation or compensation at a higher rate is warranted. Consequently, academic term salaries shall not be augmented either in rate or in total amount for research performed during the academic term. Rates of compensation for research conducted during non-academic (summer) terms shall not exceed the rate for the academic terms. When part or all of a person's services are to be charged as project costs, it is expected that the person will be relieved of an equal part or all of his or her regular teaching or other obligations. For each person or position, provide the following information:a.  	The basis for the direct labor hours or percentage of effort (e.g., historical hours or estimates).b. 	The basis for the direct labor rates or salaries. Labor costs should be predicted upon current labor rates or salaries. These rates may be adjusted upward for forecast salary or wage cost-of-living increases that will occur during the agreement period. The cost proposal should separately identify the rationale applied to base salary/wage for cost-of living adjustments and merit increases. Each must be fully explained.c. 	The portion of time to be devoted to the proposed research, divided between academic and non-academic (summer) terms, when applicable.d. 	The total annual salary charged to the research project.e. Any details that may affect the salary during the project, such as plans for leave and/or remuneration while on leave.
Fringe Benefits and Indirect Costs (Overhead, General and Administrative, and Other): The most recent rates, dates of negotiation, the base(s) and periods to which the rates apply must be disclosed and a statement included identifying whether the proposed rates are provisional or fixed. If the rates have been negotiated by a Government agency, state when and by which agency. A copy of the negotiation memorandum should be provided. If negotiated forecast rates do not exist, offerors must provide sufficient detail to enable a determination to be made that the costs included in the forecast rate are allocable according to applicable OMB Circulars or FAR/DFARS provisions. Offerors' disclosure should be sufficient to permit a full understanding of the content of the rate(s) and how it was established. As a minimum, the submission should identify:a.  All individual cost elements included in the forecast rate(s);b.  Base(s) used to prorate indirect expenses to cost pools, if any;c.  How the rate(s) was calculated;d.  Distribution basis of the developed rate(s);e.  Basis on which the overhead rate is calculated, such as "salaries and wages" or "total costs," andf.  The period of the offeror's fiscal year.
Equipment (Section C) - If facilities or equipment are required, a justification why this property should be furnished by the Government must be submitted. State the organization's inability or unwillingness to furnish the facilities or equipment. Offerors must provide an itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost for each item.  Permanent equipment is any article or tangible nonexpendable property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. The basis for the cost of each item of permanent equipment included in the budget must be disclosed, such as:a.  Vendor Quote: Show name of vendor, number of quotes received and justification, if intended award is to other than lowest bidder.b.  Historical Cost: Identify vendor, date of purchase, and whether or not cost represents lowest bid. Include reason(s) for not soliciting current quotes.c.  Engineering Estimate: Include rationale for quote and reason for not soliciting current quotes. If applicable, the following additional information shall be disclosed in the offeror's cost proposal:d.  Special test equipment to be fabricated by the awardee for specific research purposes and its cost.e.  Standard equipment to be acquired and modified to meet specific requirements, including acquisition and modification costs, listed separately.f.  Existing equipment to be modified to meet specific research requirements, including modification costs. Do not include equipment the organization will purchase with its funds if the equipment will be capitalized for Federal income tax purposes. Proposed permanent equipment purchases during the final year of an award shall be limited and fully justified.g.  Grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts may convey title to an institution for equipment purchased with project funds. At the discretion of the contracting/grants officer, the agreement may provide for retention of the title by the Government or may impose conditions governing the equipment conveyed to the organization. The Government will not convey title to commercial contractors.  Exempt property authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6306).h.  It is the policy of the DoD that all commercial and nonprofit contractors provide the equipment needed to support proposed research. In those rare cases where specific additional equipment is approved for commercial and nonprofit organizations, such approved cost elements shall be "nonfee-bearing.
Travel (Section D)- Estimate the required amount of travel and state its relationship to the research. List the proposed destinations and basis of cost estimates. Forecasts of travel expenditures (domestic and foreign) that identify the destination and the various cost elements (airfare, mileage, per diem rates, etc.) must be submitted. The costs should be in sufficient detail to determine the reasonableness of such costs. Allowance for air travel normally will not exceed the cost of round-trip, economy air accommodations. Specify the type of travel and its relationship to the research project. Requests for domestic travel must not exceed $5,000 per year per principal investigator. Separate, prior approval by BL is required for all foreign travel (i.e., travel outside the continental U.S., its possessions and Canada). Foreign travel requests must not exceed $3,000 each per year per principal investigator.  Special justification will be required for travel requests in excess of the amounts stated above and for travel by individuals other than the principal investigator(s). Individuals other than the principal investigator(s) are considered postdoctoral associates, research associates, graduate and undergraduate students, secretarial, clerical, and other technical personnel. Additional travel may be requested for travel to Army laboratories and facilities to enhance agreement objectives and to achieve technology transfer. 
Participant/Trainee Support Costs (Section E)- Estimate tuition/fees/health insurance for students.  This budget category also refers to costs of transportation, per diem, stipends, and other related costs. Generally, indirect costs are not allowed on participant support costs. The number of participants to be supported should be entered in the parentheses on the budget form. These costs should also be justified in the budget justification page(s) attached to the cost proposal.
Other Direct Costs (Section F): Materials and Supplies and Consumables: Estimate costs of materials and supplies. List types of materials needed and costs. The basis for developing the cost estimate (vendor quotes, invoice prices, engineering estimate, purchase order history, etc.) must be included.
Publication Documentation, and Dissemination Costs: The budget may request funds for the costs of preparing, publishing, or otherwise making available to others the findings and products of the work conducted under an agreement, including costs of reports, reprints, page charges, or other journal costs (except costs for prior or early publication); necessary illustrations, cleanup, documentation, storage, and indexing of data and databases; and development, documentation, and debugging of software: Estimate the costs of publishing and reporting research results. 
Consultant Services: Offerors normally are expected to utilize the services of their own staff to the maximum extent possible in managing and performing the project's effort. If the need for consultant services is anticipated, the nature of proposed consultant services should be justified and included in the technical proposal narrative. The cost proposal should include the names of consultant(s), primary organizational affiliation, each individual's expertise, daily compensation rate, number of days of expected service, and estimated travel and per diem costs. 
Subaward Costs: Support the estimate of subaward work by indicating the specific items or portion of the work to be subawarded, type of subaward anticipated, name of subawardee, and a detailed budget for each. Budgets should contain the same level of detail as required of the Prime (See Section IV, D).  Subaward budgets must be in PDF format and attached to the R&R Subaward Budget Attachment(s) Form. 
Equipment Rental User Fees: Estimate anticipated direct costs such as rental for computers or other equipment and facility usage fees. Unusual or expensive items should be fully justified. 
Indirect Costs (Section H): This section should include Overhead, General and Administrative, and Other indirect costs incurred.  Provide the most recent rates, dates of negotiations, the base(s) and period to which the rates apply, and a statement identifying whether the proposed rates are provisional or fixed. If the rates have been negotiated by a Government agency, state when and by which agency. Include a copy of any current indirect rate agreement or provide a URL if this document is available from the Internet.  Fee (Section J):  State the fixed fee, if any, which a commercial organization proposes to assess the research project. 
Budget Justification (Section K):   Using the detailed information in each of the above Sections, A through J, you must provide a Narrative explanation of how you came to each of the estimates provided.
5.	FORM: Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (Standard Form LLL) (Mandatory): If applicable, this form must be completed. This form is applicable if any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with the application for replace an award under this BAA. 
Failure to provide the requested information or exceed page limits may render the proposal non-responsive, and the proposal may not be evaluated. 
Separate attachments, such as institutional brochures or reprints, cannot be considered.  
E.	Proposal Submission Dates and Times: Proposals must be received no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Monday December 19, 2011. 
F. 	Proposal Receipt Notices: After a proposal is submitted to Grants.gov, the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) will receive a confirmation screen as well as three e-mails from Grants.gov. The first two e-mails should be received within 24 to 48 hours after submission. The first e-mail will confirm receipt of the application by the Grants.gov system, and the second will indicate that the application has either been successfully validated by the system prior to transmission to the grantor agency or has been rejected due to errors. A third e-mail should be received once the agency has confirmed receipt of the proposal. The document, Tracking Your Application Package, located at http://www.grants.gov/assets/TrackingYourApplicationPackage.pdf explains this process. It is highly recommended that grant applications be submitted 24-48 hours prior to the due date and time to avoid delays due, for example, to high system usage immediately prior to the due date and time and to allow time to ensure successful validation. 
G.	Late Submission of Proposals: Any proposal submitted through Grants.gov where the date and time of submission (as recorded in the first e-mail from Grants.gov) is after the specified deadline for proposal submission, will be considered late and will not be evaluated unless the Grants.gov website was not operational on the due date and was unable to receive the proposal submission. If this occurs, the time specified for the receipt of proposals through Grants.gov will be extended to the same time of day specified in this BAA on the first workday on which the Grants.gov website is operational.V.	PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION	Evaluation Factors:The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Evaluation of proposals shall be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal, using the following five factors listed in descending order of relative importance. Detailed evaluation factors must be addressed in the Research & Related Other Project Information (Mandatory) Form, Grants.gov, except for the Cost Realism/Probable Cost factor, which is to be addressed in the Research & Related Budget (Mandatory) Form, Grants.gov: 
1.  Scope, metrics for measuring success, time frame for implementation and expected benefits of project implementation. 
 Explain how the project addresses defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and/or diminishing sources of defense material. Address the target implementation of the technology  Explain how the proposed technology will transition to the industrial base Address how the proposal will meet short term needs of DoD Define and describe the metrics for measuring project success Detail the expected benefits to the target implementation and applications beyond the initial target implementation.
Offeror's proposal shall explicitly show how its manufacturing research project will target a specific weapon system, weapon system component or other militarily significant materiel. For the primary target implementation a point of contact (POC) must be identified in the proposal. The POC information must include name, phone number, email, and organization code and relationship to the target implementation e.g. program manager. The Contracting Officer or his/her representative reserve the option of contacting the POC to confirm implementation assertions contained in the proposal. Implementations that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not appropriate for IBIF funding. If offeror's proposal designates a single system or item of military materiel for the initial implementation it must also provide a specific path for implementation on other weapon systems/military materiel. For example, the BAA response may be for an implementation on the F-18, but it would also have to clearly show a path for implementation on the F-22, F-35, or other weapon system platform.
Proposals shall identify the tier of the industrial base which will implement the IBIF improvement and the timeframe for implementation. Prime contractors or R&D service providers, must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the lower tier DoD supplier. Component and material suppliers must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the Prime contractor and, if applicable, the Military Service Engineering Support Activity. Proposals must include POC information for organizations referenced in the proposal (see POC info above).
Proposals shall identify the metrics of success for the proposal and the timeframe for putting the technology into production in the target implementation. Metrics should be quantifiable and include baseline, threshold, and objective value estimates. The proposal should address how the manufacturing technology will address short term needs of the DoD and the expected benefits. Address any impediments to implementing the technology and how those impediments will be overcome by the proposed effort. Offerors are cautioned that statements regarding the ability to implement manufacturing technology projects may be validated with Government engineering activities. For example, if an advanced material substitution is proposed the Offeror must demonstrate an understanding of the issues associated with and a schedule for getting the proposed substitution approved or qualified by the Cognizant Engineering Authority.
Proposal shall address how the proposed technology will transition to the industrial base. The requirement is for a clearly written assessment of the need for the technology within the industrial base, the specific sectors where it will be implemented, and the expected benefits of that implementation in terms of surge production requirements and/or diminishing sources of defense material.

2.  Overall scientific and technical merit: Soundness of the technical concept Understanding the scope of technical effort needed
Offerors shall propose a manufacturing research project that includes: (a) The improved Defense manufacturing capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Warfighter, Systems Program Office and/or Logistics Support Organization; (b) Statement of Work (SOW) written in plain English detailing the scope of the effort and citing specific tasks to be performed and specific contractor performance requirements; (c) Detailed technical approach, rationale, and strategy for accomplishing technical goals in support of innovative claims and deliverables; (d) Deliverables associated with the proposed research including a clear description of the results, products, and transferable technology should be provided. (e) Realism of the schedule and milestones for each task in the proposed efforts. Include all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototypes. If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.

3.  Past performance and scientific/ manufacturing/ technical experience: Provide evidence of technical expertise, experience with the technologies included in the proposed approach
Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program and their track record in implementing manufacturing research projects. Offerors shall provide the five largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program.  
Offerors shall include at least (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. If no past performance related to manufacturing is available, offerors shall describe their track record in dealing with their comparable major customers and shall include supplemental information similar to that requested above.
Offerors are cautioned that the government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance not included in the technical proposal.

4.  Organizational and Project Management Show how the contract shall be managed Show that its organizational structure can ensure performance stability and reliable customer service
Offerors shall provide evidence of how the contract shall be managed and show that its organizational structure shall ensure performance stability, reliable customer service and commitment to DoD and IBIF for the duration of the contract performance period. Specifically, offerors shall identify key personnel including the Project Coordinator permanently assigned to the contract; and other personnel with relevant qualifications and experience.

The proposal must demonstrate scientific and technical expertise in the proposed area. Proposals must provide information on past performance, which reflects related efforts and/or achievements, technological aptitude, management support, and potential contribution and relevance to the DoD mission.
5.  Cost Realism/Probable Cost. Evaluation of the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs provided in the Research and Related Budget Form.

Ratings: It is the Government's intention to award contracts based upon proposals that demonstrate knowledge, experience, and expertise in the technical areas of interest identified in this BAA. The proposal must demonstrate scientific and technical expertise in the proposed area. Proposals must provide information on past performance, which reflects related efforts and/or achievements, technological aptitude, management support, and potential contribution and relevance to the DoD mission. The offerors responses to each evaluation factor (except for Cost Realism and Probable Cost) will receive one of the following adjectival ratings along with the narrative:
Exceptional (E)
Offeror's response contains significant strengths that demonstrate an outstanding approach to advancing manufacturing capability in one or more current systems or troop support items, especially in an identified area of interest (metals, composites and electronics).  No weaknesses in the response are identified.  No deficiencies are inherent in the response.
Highly Acceptable (HA)
Offeror's response contains strengths that demonstrate the ability of the offeror to meet or exceed an approach to advancing manufacturing capability in one or more current systems or troop support items, especially in an identified area of interest (metals, composites and electronics).  Weaknesses of the offeror's response, as identified, are not substantial enough to adversely impact the respondent's strengths. Weaknesses may be correctable through negotiations or clarifications. No deficiencies are inherent in the response.
Acceptable (A)
 Offeror's response addresses the minimal level of an approach to advancing manufacturing capability in one or more current systems or troop support items, especially in an identified area of interest (metals, composites and electronics).  Offeror's response may contain strengths, weaknesses.  Weaknesses of the offeror's response, where and if applicable, are not substantial enough to adversely impact respondent's strengths.  Weaknesses identified may be corrected through negotiations or clarifications.
Marginally Acceptable (MA)
Offeror's response addresses the minimal level of information requested in the BAA.  The offeror's response demonstrates limited understanding of the BAA and ability to meet applicable program objectives and/or performance parameters.  Identification of weaknesses and/or deficiencies determined as having an adverse impact to successful achieving program outcomes.
Unacceptable (UA)
Offeror's response does not address even the minimal level of information requested in the BAA.  The offeror's response does not demonstrate an understanding of the BAA and ability to meet applicable program objectives and/or performance parameters.  It is unlikely that the weaknesses and/or deficiencies identified can be corrected throughnegotiations or clarifications. 
For Past Performance only will be rated as follows in addition to a narrative:
Past Performance Relevancy Ratings
Rating 		Definition
Very Relevant  	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the sameScope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitationrequires.
Relevant	effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this BAA requires.
Somewhat Relevant 	effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this BAA requires.
Not Relevant 	effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this BAA requires.


Cost Realism/Probable Cost will not receive a merit rating. Evaluation of the probable cost to the Government will be in narrative form. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, any fee, and any proposed cost sharing arrangements. 
Definitions:
	Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.
	Weakness means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A significant weakness in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
	Strength is a significant, outstanding, or exceptional aspect of a vendors proposal that exceeds the evaluation standard.  It provides a useful capability that will be included in the Performance Work Statement or is inherent in the vendors process.
	The adjectival ratings are Exceptional, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Minimally Acceptable, Unacceptable (see attached evaluation sheets) or Neutral for Past Performance
	Upon receipt of a proposal, the Government will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the OSD mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to the OSDs needs or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available may be declined without further review.
All proposals are treated as privileged information prior to award and the contents are disclosed only for the purpose of evaluation. Proposals not declined as a result of an initial review will be subject to a peer review by highly qualified scientists. While the offeror may restrict the evaluation to scientists from within the government, to do so may prevent review of the proposal by those most qualified in the field of research covered by the proposal. The offeror must indicate in the proposal any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.
Each proposal will be evaluated based on the scientific merit and military relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall OSD program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.
Not all Research Proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals shall be based on funds availability.  VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION A. 	Award Notices: 
Offerors whose proposals are recommended for award will be contacted by a Contract/Grant Specialist to discuss additional information required for award. This may include representations and certifications, revised budgets or budget explanations, certificate of current cost or pricing data, small business subcontracting plan, and other information as applicable to the proposed award. The award start date will be determined at this time. A contract or grant document signed by the Government Contracting/Grants Officer is the only authorizing award document. 
Offerors whose proposals are accepted for funding shall be contacted before award to provide additional information required for award.  The required information is normally limited to updating direct and indirect rates as applied to the budget/cost proposal, clarifying budget explanations, representations, and certifications.
B. Administrative and National Policy Requirements: 
Certification Required for Grant Awards (see Section IV, D, 5): The certification at Appendix A to 32 CFR Part 28 regarding lobbying is the only certification required at the time of proposal submission for a grant award. The certification is as follows: By signing and submitting a proposal that may result in the award of a grant exceeding $100,000.00, the prospective awardee is certifying, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, that: 
(a) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the undersigned, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of an agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal grant, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. 
(b) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with this Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement, the undersigned shall complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying, in accordance with its instructions. 
(c) The undersigned shall require that the language of this certification be included in the award documents for all subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, and subgrants, and contracts under grants, and loans, or cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly. This certification is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into. Submission of this certification is a prerequisite for making or entering into this transaction imposed by section 1352, title 31, U.S. Code. Any person who fails to file the required certification shall be subject to a civil penalty or not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000.00 for each such failure.  Certifications Required for Contract Awards: Certifications and representations shall be completed by successful offerors prior to award. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DoD FAR Supplement (DFARS) Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) are at website http://orca.bpn.gov. 
Export Control: The contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations that may apply in the course of the research. 
D. 	Security: 
Classified proposals are not expected.  However, in an unusual circumstance where an offeror believes a proposal has the potential to be classified, the ARDEC Security Officer shall be contacted on (973) 724-4055 prior to the proposal's submission.
E. 	Security Requirements:  
While non-classified work is relevant, research at ARDEC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This is not always known ahead of time, and when it does the applicant must be prepared to deal with classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended.
F. 	Technology Protection Plan: 
Increasingly, the US Government relies on sophisticated technology in its systems.  Technology is todays and will be tomorrows force multiplier, and technology improves the warfighter and civil responders ability to survive and perform their mission.  It is prudent and practical to protect technologies deemed so critical that their exploitation will diminish or neutralize a US defense systems effectiveness.  Offerors may be required to develop a Technology Protection Plan in order to protect critical research technology (CRT) or critical program information (CPI).VII.

a.  Qualifications and Experience of Proposed Personnel;  b.  Technical Approach, and c.  Past Performance.

Basis of Award:  Award will be made the Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of evaluated factors offering the best overall value to the Government.

<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. IAW FAR 13.106-2 The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation will not be considered.<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information as stated above. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of "Sufficient Past Performance" or "Limited Past Performance". Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUFFICIENT PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>e. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance."</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Limited Past Performance" or when it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions.</p>

Agreement to a temporary waiver of character investigation<br />5. Licensure Requirement <br />6. Curriculum Vitae<br /><br />SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC><p><strong>Notification to all offerors: The program formerly entitled "HH-60 Recap Program" has been changed to "Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH)". Please use the new program name in all future dealings for this effort.<br /><br /><br />HH-60 Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION <br /></strong>The HH-60 Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap) is designed to replace the current United States Air Force (USAF) HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter with a new aircraft to perform Personnel Recovery (PR) operations. To assist in this planning, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), ASC/WISV, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of meeting the requirements of the approved HH-60 Recap Capability Development Document (CDD). The AF is only interested in a full aircraft system solution.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the USAF will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G aircraft. Contract award is anticipated to be in FY13. The USAF requires an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) consisting of eight (8) aircraft with training systems and support in place (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) in FY18 or sooner with a medium risk schedule. The USAF anticipates the HH-60 Recap aircraft will be an existing production helicopter with modifications using existing mature technology with only limited integration of existing subsystems as required. Respondents need to describe how their solution meets all the requirements as identified in the draft HH-60 Recap System Requirement Document (SRD). Respondent must formally request a copy of the SRD through email to the Contracting Officer and Alternate by 1300 Eastern Time 16 August 2011. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given requirements; provide rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, program risk (schedule, technical, cost) and other technical information of potential solutions.<br /><br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts and non-disclosure agreements. The Government will determine whether its contractor team members have any organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government anticipates conducting an industry day and one-on-one discussions with respondents. The timeline for these meetings has yet to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE <br /></strong>The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is to update the responses to the March 2010 and Oct 2010 Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (CRFI); to re-engage industry and provide updated information; to identify sources and capabilities that can deliver an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY18 or sooner with a medium risk schedule; and to assist the Air Force in planning and ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap aircraft. The information respondents submit may be used to refine the USAF acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP.<br /><br /><strong>RESPONSE GUIDANCE <br /></strong>Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>SSS/CRFI responses should include a Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for North American Industry Classification System (NACICS) code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 30 pages (not including SRD review comments), and must be received by 1300 Eastern Time 19 September 2011.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="COLOR: black">The Integrated Fixed Towers (IFT) Program (see: original Request for Information #HSBP0111RIFT) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) effort focused on acquiring fully-integrated, non-developmental systems having an open system architecture for use by United States Border Patrol (USBP) Agents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IFT system will assist agents in detecting, tracking, identifying and classifying items of interest along our Nation's borders through a series of fixed sensor towers and command and control center equipment that displays information on a common operating picture (COP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquisition will consist of surveillance equipment (e.g., ground surveillance radars and surveillance cameras) mounted on fixed (i.e., stationary) tower(s); all necessary power generation and communications equipment to support these tower sites; and command and control (C2) center equipment (including one or more operator workstations) capable of displaying information received from surveillance towers on a COP.</span></p>
<p>The Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA) IFT Program is hereby notifying Industry of its plan to release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early December 2011 to solicit industry feedback and to release a final RFP in January/February 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional information concerning the IFT Program is contained below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IFT</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Capabilities:</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>CBP intends to select from among non-developmental (i.e., commercial, commercial-off-the-shelf, government-off-the-shelf) offerings which represent the best balance between system performance and cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The RFP will provide a framework for performance/cost trades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the IFT system will be a "capability-based" acquisition and the RFP will indicate a set of desired capabilities in priority order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors are expected to propose a solution that is affordable, immediately producible after award, and that offers an effective and sustainable persistent surveillance capability for the USBP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The successful offeror's performance work statement (PWS) for the proposed IFT capability and the associated price will become the basis for firm fixed price contract award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IFT contract will include provisions for full Contractor Operational Support and Maintenance for the duration of the period of performance which is estimated to be 10 years. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples of Desired IFT System Performance Parameters:</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>The following are examples of the highest priority desired system capabilities. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Performance objectives below are referenced to the geographic position of an individual Fixed Surveillance Tower (FST), with all associated equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A single IFT FST shall be able to detect a single, walking, average-sized adult human at a range of up to 7.5 miles under the following conditions:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>daylight and darkness, line of sight (LoS) ranging from clear LoS to partial obstruction (50% to 95% blockage of the individual for periods of 1-3 seconds), and sustained wind speeds up to 10 MPH with gusts up to 15 MPH.</p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rationale</em>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This level of performance ensures that USBP will be able to detect the types of threats encountered under typical operating conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A single individual is likely the most difficult type of threat to detect at range, and the foliage conditions in rural and remote areas are such that individuals may disappear from LoS for brief periods of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sustained wind condition prescribed covers most conditions observed along the Arizona Border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While wind gusts greater than 15 MPH occur, the data available suggest that such gusts represent a very small portion of the operational envelope.</p>
<p>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IFT system shall provide video of sufficient quality and resolution to enable an operator to determine that a single, walking, average-sized adult is a human at a range of up to 7.5 miles relative to each individual IFT FST under the following conditions:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>daylight and darkness; LoS ranging from clear LoS to partial obstruction (50% to 95% blockage of the individual for periods of 1-3 seconds); sustained wind speeds up to 10 MPH, with gusts up to 15 MPH; moderate atmospheric turbulence.</p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rationale</em>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This level of performance ensures that USBP will be able to identify the types of threats encountered under typical operating conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IFT system operational availability (A<sub>o</sub>) shall be equal to or greater than 90%, where A<sub>o</sub> is defined as mission capable time (sum of all mission critical subsystems and units) divided by total time (mission capable time plus down time).</p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rationale</em>: USBP must perform critical mission elements 24/7 without significant disruption or degraded capability. A system is considered operationally available when it can perform in accordance with the operational requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A system is not mission capable under any condition that precludes the detection, tracking, identification or classification of items of interest (when the system would otherwise be capable of doing so).</p>

<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ANNOUNCEMENT<br />Procurement Center<br />Defense Contract Management Agency<br /><br />Attachments to this RFI are:<br />S5105A-12-R-0002 - Draft RFP attached<br />S5105A-12-Q-0001 - Draft Performance Work Statement<br />S5105A-12-Q-0002 - Draft Performance Work Statement<br /><br />NOTE:&nbsp; RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO DECEMBER 2, 2011 5:00 P.M. EASTERN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Program Overview</p>
<p>The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is seeking information to improve overall support of our Information Technology acquisitions. These initiatives are for Information Technology labor services to support the entire agency and will result in three acquisitions. The Software Acquisition Directorate operates as a center for application development, maintenance, testing, sustainment, and deployment of DCMA unique systems including Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), Shared Data Warehouse (SDW) and the DCMA Service Center. DCMA places high priority on ensuring that applications meet Agency requirements and are stable, reliable and secure.</p>
<p>Scope of Project</p>
<p>Three acquisitions to be awarded will be for the following IT efforts:</p>
<p>1) Software Development and Environmental Support - referred to as the Primary Integrator contractor S5105A-12-R-0002<br />2) Software Development and Database Support - referred to as the Primary Database contractor S5105A-12-Q-0001<br />3) Lifecycle Support/Software Development - referred to as the Primary Application Development contractor S5105A-12-Q-0002</p>
<p>A Primary Integrator is responsible for DCMA's Software Acquisition Directorate development projects that produce DCMA unique software for DCMA's Web Based Enterprise called eTools. The eTools Web Applications provide a set of tools for the input, management, retrieval, modification and storage of data in accordance with established policies, procedures and goals. DCMA eTools unique applications are built for DCMA's Functional Business Directorates such as Leadership and Management, Contracts, Pricing, Industrial Engineering, Program Integration, Quality Assurance, Government Property Management, Transportation and Packaging Contingency, and Contracts CCAS.</p>
<p>The Primary Integrator is responsible for monitoring, administration, integration, release management and deployment of all eTools software products throughout three primary development and testing centers: Development Center, System Testing Center and Acceptance Testing Center. The Primary Integrator will collaborate with the Primary Application Development contractor, the Primary Database contractor, and the Test Support contractor daily to integrate, release manage and deploy all applications, database and business intelligence software into the three centers. The integrator is required to provide a facility with 80 offices and 6 conference rooms within 150 mile radius of Fort Lee to house the other three contractors as tenants and house the 20 test servers.<br /><br />These three IT efforts require daily collaboration with other contractors. A breakout of the performance tasks for each IT effort is as follows:</p>
<p>The Primary Integrator<br />&bull; Systems Integration &amp; Maintenance Services <br />&bull; Custom Software Middleware &amp; Component Frameworks for Integration <br />&bull; Release Management Services <br />&bull; Provide Web Based Custom Application Development &amp; Maintenance Services <br />&bull; Sustainment Workflow Services <br />&bull; Webmaster Services <br />&bull; Training Development <br />&bull; Business Intelligence Infrastructure &amp; Maintenance Services <br />&bull; Technical Writing Services <br />&bull; Program Management Services <br />&bull; Facilities</p>
<p>The Primary Database contractor <br />&bull; Develop &amp; Maintain eTools Applications <br />&bull; Develop &amp; Maintain Integrated Database <br />&bull; Develop &amp; Maintain Reports, Cubes, Query &amp; Business Intelligence Services <br />&bull; Develop Performance Indicators into Cognos Metrics Manager <br />&bull; Provide Database Support for EITS <br />&bull; Service Oriented Architecture <br />&bull; Develop and Maintain Portlets <br />&bull; Training Development <br />&bull; Communications &amp; Marketing Support <br />&bull; Software Development Program Management &amp; Reporting</p>
<p>Primary Application Development contractor <br />&bull; Software Development <br />&bull; Maintain eTools Applications &amp; EITS <br />&bull; Application Database Support <br />&bull; IBM Cognos Metrics Studio <br />&bull; Develop User Manuals &amp; Online Help Documentation <br />&bull; Service Oriented Architecture <br />&bull; Training Development <br />&bull; Program Management Support</p>
<p><br />The government anticipates these requirements will result in firm-fixed price contracts which will include a one-year base period and provisions for three or four one-year option periods. The Primary Integrator contract will be FAR Part 15 and the other acquisitions will be conducted under GSA, Schedule 70, Information Technology.</p>
<p>Along with responses to the questions below, interested contractors should submit a capability statement for this requirement not to exceed 6 pages, single sided pages including all attachments, charts, etc. (single spaced, 11 point font minimum) that clearly details the firm's ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the attached draft PWS.</p>

<DESC>The FAA Technical Training Office (AJL) has a need to obtain software and associated technical support services to implement and execute a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) that will be deployed enterprise-wide in the FAA.  The LCMS will include functions to support the design, development, and evaluation of training for FAA ATCs and technicians today and in the future, as NextGen is implemented.  As our National Aviation System transforms to meet the demands of a new century of aviation, AJL has to ensure that our training workforce, ATCs, and technicians have the right tools and technology for training, to meet these demands.
This is an extremely important initiative to our organization and will serve as a benefit to the Agency.  The LCMS will become the foundation of a shared training development environment that provides productivity efficiencies and cost savings in the development and lifecycle management of training programs and supporting materials for the FAA.

<p>a) To the FDA's knowledge Ex Libris is the only company that offers software maintenance for the ILS modules FDA is currently using (Aleph, SFX, Metalib, and Verde).</p>
<p>b) Any delay in service would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541511. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A solicitation will be issued to Ex Libris (USA) Inc. no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines otherwise. All written inquiries must be submitted to Syntoria Spencer, Contract Specialist, via email at syntoria.spencer@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), Thursday, December 1, 2011.</p>

If so, are these backwalls and sills located at the FS yard in Thorne Bay? 3)The exsisting D-1 topping at the approaches will need to be removed to do the work. Does the FS have a D-1 topping stockpile in the area, where contractor can get a load to plus up the approaches when the re-installation is complete?
<p><br />~The government will cancel this solicitation in its entirety while we redefine the Statement of Work to more adequately answer these questions.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SamKnows LTD, 25 Harley St, London, GBR for continued data collection, testing and verification services necessary to ensure that the FCC continues to have access to accurate broadband measurement and testing data. A contract was competitively awarded in April 2010 to SamKnows to obtain measurement and test data using software and hardware proprietary to SamKnows. It's "white box" hardware containing the proprietary software subsequently was deployed to approximately 9,000 sample panelists who were selected to participate in the study based, in critical part, on statistically relevant selection criteria proprietary to SamKnows and whose identity is known only to SamKnows. A subsequent six month sole source contract was awarded to SamKnows on May 3, 2011 to continue this work. The FCC issued a Report describing the results of the study in August 2011. <br /><br />The FCC requires an additional one year contract to enable further data collection, analysis, and the preparation of a 2012 study, with a one year option to include, if necessary, the preparation of a 2013 study report. Continued access to accurate broadband performance measurement data can only be achieved through the use of the technology and panel participants currently in place. Maintaining the integrity of this approach to data collection and analysis will enable the FCC to develop time series assessments of changes in the panel's broadband use over different periods. It also will avoid the introduction of new methodologies that could compromise the policy value of the data gathered in the studies. Another vendor would not be able to replicate the measurement study using the same proprietary processes and existing panel participants, thereby compromising the integrity of the collection process and the compatibility of the data for purposes of comparative studies, projections, etc. SamKnows is the only source for collecting, analyzing and providing this data with the existing deployed hardware and software to the same group of approximately 9000 panelists. <br /><br />The FCC is not soliciting quotes from other parties and this notice is for informational purposes only. If you believe you can do this follow on work please submit your capabilities by the closing date of this announcement. Responses may be emailed to the contracting officer prior to the closing date.</p>

<DESC>An Industry Day took place 14-15 November 2011 regarding the referenced MAIDIQ follow-on contract.  The purpose of this special announcement is to provide information gathered from Industry Day, the briefing slides presented, and to extend the date for receipt of Capabilities Statements and comments to the Draft RFP to 22 November 2011.  Based upon discussions with industry, feedback is requested on the following questions.<br><br>1)  The Draft RFP as currently stated incorporates FAR 52.215-1 indicating the Government intends to award without discussions.  Please indicate any impact on the preparation of your proposal to include impediments you may perceive that would restrict information that you would otherwise convey if discussions were held prior to award.<br>   <br>2)  The anticipated NAICS code for all four domains is 541330 - Engineering Services.  What is your view regarding how this NAICS fits under each domain?  Recommendations are encouraged.<br>  <br>3)  Per Section H.10 and L.14.2 of the Draft RFP, does your company understand how to calculate the total contract value for purposes of small business participation/utilization?<br>     <br>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Contracting and Acquisition Management Office (CAMO), in support of the DoD CNTPO, awarded five prime contracts to provide the necessary goods and services required by DoD CNTPO to support CN/CNT missions of DoD, OGAs, partner nations and State and local authorities.  These contracts were omnibus type arrangements, under which the prime contractors were required to satisfy the entire scope of work.  The ordering date for these contracts ends 23 August 2012.  Attachment 1 is the current Scop of Work.  The Scope of Works per domain are as follows:<br><br>Attachment 2 - Training<br>Attachment 3 - Operations and Logistics<br>Attachment 4 - Program Support<br>Attachment 5 - Command, Control, Communications, Information, Detection & Monitoring (C3IDM)<br><br>The purpose of this announcement is to advise prospective prime contractors that the Government intends to execute a follow-on procurement.  For purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to gain information regarding the capabilities, capacity and qualifications of interested prime contractors. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED BASED UPON INFORMATION GAINED FROM THIS INFORMATION EXCHANGE SESSION.  The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy, there is a Draft solicitation, and there is no other information available at this time.  Other than information provided herein, no other information is available, and no other responses or inquiries will be accepted.  <br><br>OVERVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS:<br><br>This acquisition is for critical services and procurements in support the Department of Defense Counter Narco-Terrorism Program Office mission to disrupt, deter, and defeat the threat to national security posed by illicit trafficking in drugs, small arms and explosives, precursor chemicals, people, and illicitly-gained and laundered money. Support shall be provided in the following domains: Training; Operations, Logistics, and Minor Construction; Program and Programmatic Support; and Command, Control, Communications, Information, Detection & Monitoring (C3IDM).  Within these broad domain definitions, are requirements for operations & logistics, minor construction, and provision of materials and end-items.  The scopes of work for each of these domains is provided as Attachments 2 through 5 respectively.  <br><br>Type of Contract:  The Government contemplates the execution of each domain as a MAIDIQ arrangement with the following anticipated number of awards: Training (up to 7 awards with reservation of up to 3 awards for small business); Operations, Logistics, and Minor Construction (up to 7 awards); Program and Programmatic Support (100% small business set aside with up to 5 awards); and C3IDM (up to 5 awards).  The Government contemplates the establishment of pricing matrices from which the price for task orders will be based.  Maximum labor rates, maximum indirect rates and maximum profit/rates will be included in the pricing matrices.  The type of task order will be established at the task order level and will be based upon the nature and complexity of the instant requirements.  It is contemplated that Firm, Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed-Price-Incentive-Fee (FPIF), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), Fixed-Price-Labor-Hour (FP LH), with potential for Cost  Reimbursable Materials, ODCs, Travel and DBA and hybrids thereof will be employed.  The term of each MAIDIQ will be one (1) 2-year base ordering period with three (3) 1-year ordering periods, commencing on or about 29 May 2012.  <br><br>Estimated MAIDIQ ceiling:  A shared ceiling is established for each domain MAIDIQ.  The value of each domain ceiling is:<br><br>Operations, Logistics, and Minor Construction: $950M<br>Command, Control, Communications, Information Detection & Monitoring (C31DM): $875M<br>Training: $975M<br>Program & Programmatic Support: $240M  <br><br><br>The NAICS Code for all domains is: NAICS 541330, size standard $27M  <br><br>Inherent in the execution of these scope of work are the following.  This information is preliminary and further information/details will be provided in a published Request for Proposals (RFP).<br><br>1. The Contractor will be required to provide these goods and services at CONUS and OCONUS locations and must plan accordingly, to include but not be limited to insurance, security, ITAR, export compliance, shipping and logistics.  These requirements are worldwide; however, the primary regional areas of interest include Central and Western Asia, Sub-Sahara Africa, and Central and South America.  <br>2. The Contractor must consider the requirements for delivering goods and services to remote and austere locations worldwide.   <br>3. Support may be required either as temporary duty (TDY) non-local travel or on-site support at destinations, which include both CONUS and OCONUS locations, to include possible deployment to theaters of operations/war zones. Personnel arming requirements are possible.  <br>4. Certain contractor personnel will be required to possess TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) CLEARANCE and/or be eligible for immediate adjudication by the cognizant security authority upon award of the contract.  Future requirements for SCI-eligible personnel will be identified in individual task orders.  The contractor shall have or be able to obtain a Top Secret "Facility Clearance" and shall possess "Safeguarding Capabilities."  Some task orders issued under this contract may require access to, and clearance for, Special Access Programs (SAPs) up to and including the TOP SECRET/SCI level.  Some task orders will require access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  The contractor shall perform in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220.22M) and ensure that all classified material is handled in accordance with the latest appropriate security classification specifications.  For task orders requiring TS/SCI clearance, foreign participation will not be allowed at the prime or subcontract level.<br>5. Performance of this anticipated effort will be subject to Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) provisions (see FAR Subpart 9.5) at the prime and task order level.  Firms performing directly or indirectly in a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant capacity on any program funded or managed by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>), or programs funded or managed in conjunction with  U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)  may be precluded from participation in this contemplated acquisition, dependent upon whether actual or perceived conflicts of interest can be mitigated.  Furthermore, any awardee under this contemplated acquisition that provides support under an individual task order to a system or program managed by USASMDC/ARSTRAT or other associated air, space, and missile defense organizations, may be precluded from participating as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant on future acquisitions directly or indirectly involving that system or program.<br>6. Contractors will be required to comply with ITAR requirements and will be required to export information and material to OCONUS locations.  <br><br>CNTPO ORGANIZATION AND MISSION<br><br>CNTPO is an acquisition program office working directly in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counter Narcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>).  The mission of CNTPO is to provide acquisition support to the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, State and local authorities, and partner nation agencies to disrupt, deter, and defeat the threat to national security posed by illicit trafficking in all its manifestations:  drugs, small arms and explosives, precursor chemicals, people, and illicitly-gained and laundered money.<br><br>Working primarily with the Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC), CNTPO performs technical and program management activities as required to convert requirements into contract actions and to ensure Government oversight is maintained throughout the performance of all activities associated with this acquisition. The associated end user community includes agencies such as, but not limited to:  (a) the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force South; (b) U.S. drug law enforcement agencies (including the Drug Enforcement Administration & U.S. Customs and Border Protection); and (c) Department of State (including the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs); and (d) individual partner nation agencies with law enforcement authorities.<br><br>The activities of the DASD-CN> span across the full spectrum of response to the illicit exchange continuum.  Since terrorist and militant organizations can easily tap into the transnational illicit marketplace (predominated by illicit drug proceeds) to underwrite their activities and acquire arms and other supplies to conduct insurgent operations, CNTPO must be able to respond to a wide range of acquisition requirements throughout the world and that extend beyond traditional DoD acquisition and contracting scopes. <br><br>Due to the rapid adaptability of the counter narco-terrorist threat, special federal Government spending authorities are available to the DASD-CN>.  Due to political and operational considerations, projects and requirements are usually determined and must be responded to quickly.   For existing goods and services, a typical timeline of 60-90 days from requirements identification to award is expected, with accelerated awards possible.  <br><br>INFORMATION REQUESTED: <br><br>If you believe your firm possesses the technical capability, financial, facility, equipment and personnel resources, and relevant experience/past performance to perform the type of work specified above as a prime contractor, please submit the following information.  Responses to this request shall be limited to 30 pages or less, excluding coversheets and/or table of contents, and must be received by 4:00 pm (CST), 22 November 2011.  Responses shall be submitted electronically to patricia.c.ashley@smdc.army.mil.<br><br>Again, this announcement is being used solely to gather market research information.

Discuss your capability to perform under each of the technical functional area(s) that your firm is interested in.  Disclose the portion of the domainthat you DO NOT have past experience in.       <br>10.

Discuss your firm's financial capacity to prime this effort.  Discuss your financial ability to support an effort of this size and scope, considering that payments may be as much as 90-120 calendar days in arrears of actual performance on multiple task orders.<br>12. Discuss the type and number of facilities that are currently available and would be proposed to be used to satisfy the scope of work (describe the type of facilities, capacity, capabilities and equipment, facilities clearance level, etc), as applicable.<br>13. Identify any real or potential organizational conflicts of interest that your firm may have regarding your status as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant on any program funded or managed by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>), or programs funded or managed in conjunction with  U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM).  Address each system and/or program separately and provide your planned approach for mitigating any conflicts.  If no real or potential conflicts exist, so state.<br><br>If your anticipated participation will be that of a small business joint-venture, you must identify each joint venture participant.  If participation will be that of a newly formed small business joint venture, provide the information required above for each participant in the joint venture.<br><br>If you are a small business, and if the Government were to set this (or any portion of this) acquisition aside for small business (either as a 100% set aside or a partial set aside), you would be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime.  The prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of 'ostensible subcontractor' as set forth in 13 CFR 212.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(H)(3).

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) Real Time Location Systems (RTLS) Industry Day was hosted on November 8, 2011.  VA thanks you for your participation.  The intention of the RTLS Industry Day was to provide preliminary information on VA's anticipated technical requirements, business/contract considerations, acquisition approach, sub-contracting information and an opportunity for contractors to ask questions and for interested firms to network with each other. The purpose of this specific special notice is to provide interested firms with the information resulting from the RTLS Industry Day and One-on-One Contractor meetings.  The following documents can be found at https://www.voa.va.gov (VA TAC Website): 

1)	Attachment A - VA RTLS Industry Day Brief
2)	Attachment B - Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) Brief
3)	Attachment C - VA RTLS Industry Day Participants and Contact Information
4)	Attachment D - VA RTLS Industry Day Questions & Answers (Q&A)
The Draft RFP is expected to be released in early December 2011.  VA anticipates posting additional questions and answers from the RTLS Industry Day on an on-going basis, which will be posted to the VA TAC Website by subject matter (RTLS Overview, Acquisition Questions, Enterprise System Engineering & Interface Task Orders, VISN 23 Task Order and OSDBU).  All documents are subject to change at any time; therefore, please continue to check the VA TAC website and FedBizOpps website periodically for updates and additional information.  Please note, attendance/participation at the Industry Day Conference is not a prerequisite for participation in any solicitation that may eventually result from the conference.

TAC Austin has setup a VA RTLS hotline, which can be reached at (512)-981-4409.  The VA RTLS hotline has been setup to provide contractors with a single source that provides the current status, updates and any other additional information in regards to VA RTLS acquisition.

Any other additional recommendations or questions should be forwarded to Robert Spierto at Robert.Spierto@va.gov.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>LEASE NUMBER:   GS-09B-02532<br />PROJECT NUMBER:	1CA2522<br />Agency Name: Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA-OIG)</p>
<p>1.	Identification and Description of Action Being Approved:<br />The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) currently leases approximately 10,395 rentable, 8,837 usable (ANSI/BOMA) square feet of office space and twenty seven (27) structured parking spaces at 5120 Shoreham Place, in San Diego, California under lease number GS-09B-0252 for Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA-OIG). The current lease expires November 25, 2011.  Approval is requested to negotiate an extension with the incumbent landlord without a full and open competition for continued occupancy at this leased location.</p>
<p>2.	Description of Supplies or Services Required:<br />VA-OIG currently occupies 10,395 rentable square feet of space in a lease that expires on November 25, 2011. The rental is not expected to be changed and the current rental rate is $36.87/rsf. The estimated annual cost of this lease is $36.87/rsf per year for an annual cost of $383,288.88.  The total cost for the three (3) months extension is estimated to be $95,822.22. The Government requires a three (3) month extension of its current lease to commence on November 26, 2011 with cancellation rights, in whole or in part, on or after November 27, 2011 giving thirty (30) days written notice. Extending the lease is necessary to protect the Government's occupancy, while allowing time for a build out to be completed.</p>
<p>3.	Identification of Statutory Authority:<br />41 U.S.C. &sect;253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>4.	Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires use of the Authority Cited:<br />GSAM 570.405(c)(2) allows for negotiation with the incumbent lessor when the Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its control in acquiring replacement space.   VA-OIG has occupied the above referenced space under Lease No. LCA02532 since May 26, 2010.  A lease extension is required to allow time for build-out of space to be completed in regard to a new/replacing lease.  If other space was leased for the extension period, the government would incur build-out, and relocation cost, first  to their temporary location and then to their permanent space.  A double move would create an administrative hardship and interrupt agency operations.  Furthermore, the Government would incur additional cost for the agency tenant improvements</p>
<p>5.	Description of Efforts to Solicit as Many Offers as Practicable:<br />No attempt to solicit additional offers was made for this lease action.  A New/Replacing lease action was undertaken and awarded to the incumbent landlord on November 1, 2011 utilizing Full and Open Competition.  This lease action is a short-term extension to allow completion of the necessary build-out required under the terms of the replacing lease.</p>
<p>6.	Demonstration that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable:<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303-2(b)(7), the Contracting Officer determines by certifying this document that the anticipated cost to the Government of $36.87/rsf for the entire requirement is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Recent market surveys conducted by GSA in San Diego, California via Loop net, Costar, and a new replacing lease that was awarded showed that comparable full service rental rate, ranges between $22.80 and $35.40 per RSF.</p>
<p>7.	Description of the Market Survey Conducted:<br />A market survey was conducted on October 13, 2011.  The following comparable properties were used to establish market rates for fully serviced leases.</p>

<p>5120 Shoreham Pl San Diego, Ca.<br /> $35.40<br />4350 La Jolla Village Dr San Diego, Ca.<br /> $33.00<br />8910 University Center Ln San Diego, Ca.	$31.80</p>
<p>3655 Nobel Drive San Diego, Ca.	$28.20</p>
<p>3636 Nobel Drive San Diego, Ca.	$22.80</p>
<p>8.	 Other Facts supporting the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />Relocation to another facility would involve significant down-time for the Agency and duplicative cost for the Government.  Under the terms of its current lease, a full complement of systems furniture is provided as part of the rental rate.  If the VA-OIG is relocated to another site, the Government would need to replicate cost for systems furniture (Approximated at $100k); data cabling; telephone cabling and other operational administrative costs.</p>
<p>9.	 List of Sources that Expressed an Interest in the Acquisition:<br />GSAM 570.405(c)(2) allow for negotiation with the incumbent lessor when the Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its control in acquiring replacement space.</p>
<p>10.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:<br />There is no plan of action to overcome barriers to competition for this requirement because a full and open competition was completed for the VA-OIG long term requirement.  The cost to relocate to another space for the short term of this extension far exceeds the cost of remaining in the current space.</p>
<p>11.	Contracting Officers Determination and Certification:</p>
<p>I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
