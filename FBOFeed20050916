<DESC>The Anderson Ranch Powerplant, located approximately 28 miles northeast of Mountain Home, Idaho; about 3-1/2 miles from Route 20 in Elmore County, at the southwest end of Anderson Ranch Reservoir on South Fork of Boise River, has a requirement for furnishing, installing, and testing new static exciters, including fused disconnect switches, power potential transformers, rectifier bridges, and digital voltage regulators.    The work also includes furnishing drawings and data; removing and disposing of existing voltage regulators and generator field breakers; modifying existing rotating main exciters; furnishing and installing conduit for power and control wiring and furnishing and installing conductors for power circuits; furnishing spare parts; and training Government personnel in operation and maintenance of new excitation system.   We consider acquisition of this excitation system to be a SUPPLY acquisition and we intend to award a firm fixed price SUPPLY contract as a result of this solicitation.  If a HUBZone small business concern submits an offer, for purposes of applying a HUBZone small business price evaluation preference for a SUPPLY contract, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-(d)(2), the HUBZone small business concern will need to agree that at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing, excluding the cost of materials, will be performed by the concern or another HUBZone small business concern, in order to be considered for the price evaluation preference.  In addition, even if the price evaluation preference applies, as stated in the solicitation price is the least important factor in our evaluation criteria, and therefore award may not be made to the lowest priced evaluated offer.   Award will be based on the best value to the Government and evaluation criteria will include technical factors, past performance, experience, price and price-related factors.  The criteria will be further defined in the solicitation. This requirement is not set-aside.  The solicitation will be available on CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format and will be available on or about October 5, 2005 (this is an estimated date). To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/supply.   Visit the website to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don't provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and a charge of $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which we will consider. See numbered notes 12 and 26.

<DESC>The Structural Science Center is the newest research Center in AFRL's Air Vehicles Directorate.  Our Center is active in conducting basic and applied research in the broad area of aerospace structural design.  Current areas of interest include structures operating in extreme environments (e.g., high temperature, high acoustic, and mechanical loading) and risk-quantified design.  The research goals for each area are described in the full text announcement.  This collaborative effort will be an extension of our in house center.  It is envisioned that there will be a large amount of interaction between the collaborative researchers and AFRL researchers.  This interaction will include regular weekly on-site visits and frequent short notice visits, and as such will require that researchers be able to travel quickly and on short notice between locations.

Offers must be received by close of business at 4:00 p.m. on December 12, 2005. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).

EACH OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL SHALL BE PREPARED AS OUTLINED BELOW. A) PART 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE. The evaluation of Part 1 data will result in a rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory. Factor: Past performance or experience in the snow removal and sanding industry. B) PART 2 - PRICE. The evaluation of Part 2 will result in ranking the quotation by lowest aggregate price. Factor: Price. Offerors must prepare proposals in sufficient detail to permit a thorough evaluation of each part. Each part must be clearly marked "Part 1 – Past Performance" and "Part 2 - Price". The offerors will be evaluated using the Performance - Price Trade-Off procedures in accordance with Attachment No. 3, entitled "Evaluation of Offerors". (I) FACTOR 1: PAST PERFORMANCE. Offerors shall provide information on present and past performance that summarizes present and prior Government (federal, state and local) and commercial contracts they consider relevant to this effort and the evaluation criteria to demonstrate their ability to perform the proposed effort. Offerors are advised that the Government will use all available data. All such data used, including data related to offeror's performance as a subcontractor and to the performance of the offeror's proposed subcontractor(s) will be reflected in the evaluation of the prime contractor.  (1)   Quality and Satisfaction Rating for Contracts Completed in the Past Three years:  Provide any information currently available (letters, metrics, awards, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrate customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed product for same or similar type contract.  In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.  (2) Performance Surveys:  The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirments of this RFP.  The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance.  Provide a list of no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. Submit information on contracts that you consider relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort.  Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate.  This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnal who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  Furnish the following information: (i) Company/Division Name, (ii) Product/Service, (iii) Contracting Agency/Customer, (iv) Contract Number, (v) Contract Dollar Value, (vi) Period of Performance, (vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, E-mail address, FAX and telephone number of the Contracting Officer, (viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions, (ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, and (x) Submit information on key personnel, major subcontractors, and work performed as a team of joint venture partner if prime contract history is not available.   If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent pas/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner.  If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contract.  For each contract identified in paragraph (2) above, forward the Experience Questionnaire found in paragraph (3) at attachment No. 4 to the company for their completion.   (3) Completed Performance Survey Submittal:  It will be the sole responsibility of the offeror to ensure that the questionnaires are received by their referenced sources and returned to the Contracting Office not later than the proposal due date.  The cover letter that is used to forward the questionnaire to your references should instruct them to e-mail it to:  William.Turczyn@rl.af.mil , mail it to:  AFRL/IFKO, ATTN: William Turczyn, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, or FAX it to:  (315) 330-2555.  Once completed, the questionnaires will become source selection information; so the media used for transmittal of the completed questionnaire shall be marked as "SOURCE SELECTION SENSITIVE".  In the event that a questionnaire is faxed back, references shall be instructed to call William Turczyn @ (315) 330-1953 relaying that a FAX is being transmitted that contains source selection information.   The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, none, marginal, or unsatisfactory. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "none", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. (II) FACTOR 2: PRICE. Price will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness as it relates to the service offered. (1) Fairness and reasonableness - the degree to which the proposed price compares to the price a reasonable and prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar goods or services.  Insert proposed unit and extended prices at Attachment 5, Bid Schedules for Base Year, Option Year 1, Option year 2, Option Year 3, and Option Year 4 for each Line Item.  Combine the cumulative total price of all line items for each of the 5 years (Base year plus 4 option years) and arrive at a Grand Total. The cost/price information shall be submitted in typed format for legibility.   Award will be made based on the best value to the Government. Past Performance and Price are of equal value.   FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, is applicable.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intend to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Joseph Swerdzewski and Associates (JSA) to provide expert consulting services in Federal Human Resources and Labor Relations on Federal sector labor law, current case law, interpretation and application of case law to the extensive variety of situations at hand, but not limited to, new term negotiations with the Union, implementation of Human Resource (HR) Reform Initiatives, and unit representation cases based on the statutory exclusion of national security using current case precedent and exploring new case law development promoting the application of the national security exclusion to positions involved in safeguarding the food supply in today’s environment.  JSA has the expertise for the critical tasks at hand without jeopardizing the Agency’s goals of negotiating an agreement with the National Joint Council (NJC) that most effectively paves the way for HR Reform within the bargaining unit and of attaining its public health mission through the exclusion of appropriate positions from the unit based on national security interests.  JSA is familiar with the organizational structure and mission of the Agency from past contacts with the Agency and has qualifications as former Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) General Council. JSA offers a unique array of insight and expertise that will significantly benefit the Agency as it goes before FLRA and the Federal Services Impasse Panel (FSIP) to litigate disputed contract proposals, and anticipated outcome of negotiations. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact.

<SOLNBR>FSIS-18-B-05

<CONTACT>Kathy Richardson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-504-4215, Fax 301-504-4276, Email Kathy.Richardson@fsis.usda.gov
<DESC>USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has a requirement for support for the Laboratory Sample Flow System (LSFS) and Microbiological and Residue Computer System (MARCIS).   The applications supported by these systems require a high level of expertise in the agency’s data and reporting requirements as well as the sampling programs conducted. The expertise must be of a level to quickly troubleshoot problems with applications.  There is a need for the contractor to have intimate knowledge of the operation and function of these highly specialized applications.  The contractor must be able to develop modules for existing applications to accommodate the agency’s changing sampling programs and reporting needs.  

USDA/FSIS intends to purchase these services from ID Enterprises, Inc.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is Citation 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The prospective follow-on procurement will be a Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Fixed Price No Fee Contract with a 1-year period of performance.  Currently this work is being performed under Contract 53-3A94-02-04 by ID Enterprises, Inc.

The objective of this procurement is to continue to support and provide enhancements to these critical agency applications until such time as they are replaced.  The agency’s minimum need is to have a contractor with in-depth knowledge of these applications to provide support and enhancements and a statistician with intimate knowledge of the Agency’s sampling and testing programs.  The current customized software and HP3000 hardware is the vehicle to be used for data warehousing of the analytical results and sample disposition until the final phase of validation of analysis is implemented on the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and the Public Health Data Suite (which includes PREP, LEARN, M2K and eSAMPLE and is under development) is fully implemented. 

ID Enterprises has developed and continue to maintain mission critical applications for the agency. This vendor provides a source of immediate knowledge of the detailed and complex sampling criteria and rules for the many and various sampling programs conducted by the agency.  The applications maintained by ID Enterprises are mission critical to the agency’s laboratories to provide timely data to agency field and headquarters personnel on sample status and laboratory results of product or carcasses which may be held pending laboratory results.  The time and expense of training another contractor in all the nuances of the agency’s sampling and reporting programs as well as the complexities of the custom software would result in unacceptable delays to meeting the requirements of the Agency.   One of the critical applications resides on antiquated hardware (HP3000 series 948) no longer supported by the vendor.  ID Enterprises owns and maintains a compatible HP3000 system running the same level MPE/iX operating system and software platforms. This allows ID Enterprises to test and develop software in-house without putting an excessive load on the agency’s system prior to implementation of software updates or edits. Until existing applications can be replaced, it is mandatory to keep them operating.  The contractor’s statistician has extensive knowledge of the statistics used to publish the Final Rule on Pathogen Reduction Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (PR/HACCP) Systems which focus to reduce both pathogenic organisms on meat and poultry products and the incidence of food borne illness associated with these products.  The statistician’s expertise is used extensively in the development of new performance standards for baseline studies, HACCP for Residues, and microbiological testing programs for Ready-to-Eat, E.coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria mono. and other pathogen testing.  With the implementation of electronic collection of information and submission of forms the statistician performs extensive QA/QC of the data, screens and reporting.  

There is an urgent need to maintain and enhance these custom applications as the agency’s mission to collect, analyze and report sample results involves public health.  Samples collected and submitted for testing are typically held in the establishments until laboratory results are received.  Notification of presumptive and confirmed positive samples with pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, E.coli O157:H7 and Salmonella occurs utilizing these applications.  Protecting public health is at stake in assuring these applications function continuously. There are tasks needed to complete modules for applications used to conduct the agency’s sampling programs or to make modifications to existing modules in order to meet the agency’s changing needs.  The transition to new applications and systems will require modifications to legacy applications to ensure the agency’s critical mission of ensuring public health safety is not interrupted.  ID Enterprises, Inc., has a staff of programmers and statistician with intimate knowledge of the Agency’s sampling programs and the specialized software utilized to schedule samples, input and store laboratory data and provides reporting of the laboratory data.  ID Enterprises owns and maintains an HP3000 system in order to develop and test applications without having to put the additional burden on the production system used by the laboratories.  This is critical for timely development and modification work to laboratory applications.  

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Award will be made utilizing FAR Part 12.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday, September 21, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be submitted to Kathy Richardson, Contracting Officer, at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD  20705-5230.   Responses will also be accepted by fax at 301-504-4276 or by e-mail at Kathy.Richardson@fsis.usda.gov.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.
A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent, as demonstrated by the currently deployed BioWatch surveillance system.  In FY04, HSARPA initiated two critical bio-sensor development initiatives under the Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures (DSBCC) Program, RA03-01. These systems, the Bioagent Autonomous Networked Detectors (BAND) and the Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS), will provide a cost effective, robust capability for continuous monitoring for a broad range of potential bio-aerosol threats with very high sensitivity and specificity.  As a complement to the technology programs initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA also initiated the BAA04-18 Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS) program to develop, test and transition the next generation of rapid bio-aerosol sensors for use in Detect-to-Protect system architectures. 

As a compliment to the above programs, HSARPA is initiating the Low-cost Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (LBADS) program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) intends to address the need for very low-cost bio-aerosol sensors (<$1,000 each for high quantity production runs) to further enhance the Detect-to-Protect technologies developed under the IBADS program.  The LBADS program will develop optimized sensor systems characterized by the following performance metrics (see Appendix G for definitions):

+ Improved Sensitivity (Level of Detection)
+ Low Probability of False Positive (Pfp)
+ High Probability of Detection (Pd)
+ Rapid Response Time
+ Very Low Cost of Ownership

The LBADS program will support research to determine trade-offs between the above metrics for selected sensor concepts, with a particular emphasis on the development of very low cost (<$1,000) biological sensors.  DHS intends to collaborate with the Department of Defense (DoD) to complete this effort and will place a high priority on transferring technology developed under DARPA’s SUVOS Program. 

Attached to this synopsis is the Broad Agency Announcement for the LBADS effort. This document and additional information is available at http://www.hsarpabaa.com.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT:  The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new five-year multi-center clinical trial, Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT).  The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) is a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of around-the-clock, supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPPED) and moderately severe hypoxemia.  The ultimate goal of the NHLBI is to improve clinical management of COPPED, with increased length and quality of life for patients with COPPED.  It is estimated that data will be collected from approximately 5,000 subjects and that it will include demographics, medical history, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests, and responses to questionnaires.  Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled over a 30 month period at each of approximately 20 Regional Clinical Centers solicited under a separate request for proposal.  Subjects will be followed for up to 42 months.  One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial will also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all RCCs or at only a subset of the RCCs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Substudy Subcommittee of the Steering Committee.  The DCC will: 1) provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for study monitoring; and for the analysis of study data;  2) administrative guidance, oversight, and support for the LOTT as a whole; promoting interactions among the RCCs and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; 3) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair; 4) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 4) coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB); 5) prepare and distribute minutes of the Steering Committee meetings; 6) establish and maintain a computer system and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data; 7) develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of LOTT information, documents, and forms to the RCCs, 8) develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about the LOTT for the lay public; 9) prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating RCCs, the project officer, a HCFA representative and the contracting officer, and 10) review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy.  Monitor adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study.  The DCC will frequently need to make quick decisions, often based on medical information obtained from the clinics.  Therefore, staff will need to possess the strong medical and scientific qualifications and experience relating to COPPED.  The DCC’s medical monitor should be board-certified in pulmonary medicine, have expertise in the clinical management of COPPED, and experience in clinical research.  The DCC must have experience with complex multi-center trials, readily available medical expertise, and the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, medical morbidity and mortality data.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer at the above noted address.  The capabilities statement submitted in response to this synopsis shall include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientist, medical expert, and technical personnel in accordance with the above outline requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, and 4) an outline of previous multi-center research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated and any other information considered relevant to this program.  The information provided must also establish the institution’s status as a small business.  Three copies of the capabilities statement must be received at the address listed above twelve days from the publication date of this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns.  The RFP will be available in FedBizOpps and electronically via the NHLBI Website.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Improved Control Surface Seals ABSTRACT 	Control surface seals are required in reentry vehicles to seal the gaps between actuated control surfaces.  These seals prevent the ingestion of high temperature gases into temperature sensitive locations.  Current state-of-the-art control surface seals are insufficient for advanced reentry vehicle applications and suffer from poor resiliency (springback after compression) at high temperatures, limited wear resistance, and inadequate structural integrity in some situations.  The current control surface seals consist of a Saffil (registered trademark) batting core, a knitted Inconel X-750 spring tube, and 2 layers of braided Nextel 312 sleeving.  The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has developed and tested improvements to individual components of this seal and would now like to incorporate these improvements into an integrated seal design.  SPECIFICATIONS 	The selected vendor shall produce 10 ft. samples of various designs for the control surface seals.	With the exception of the improved components, the seal samples should resemble the baseline seal in terms of configuration and construction as closely as possible.  Further details (Tables and detailed instructions) regarding the individual components will be provided with the RFQ.   This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 339991 and 500, respectively. The anticipated release date of the RFQ is on or about Wednesday, September 22, 2005 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about Friday, October 11, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is	 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22	   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential quoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.    All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax) to Nikki D. Brown not later than 5 days after release of the RFQ.	Telephone questions will not be accepted.

1.  Background

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the U.S. Department of Commerce assists foreign commercial, political, regulatory and judicial leaders to identify and make needed changes in laws and organizational structures, including those adopted under the platform of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to a qualified expert to serve as a Short-Term Advisor to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (GOBiH).  BiH is currently in the process of acceding to the WTO. The Advisor will provide technical assistance (acting through CLDP) to the GOBiH and will plan and coordinate technical assistance to be conducted by CLDP on WTO issues to further BiH’s accession process.

2.  General Description of Work

The Advisor will provide general guidance on the obligations of WTO membership, including all annexes, and on how the obligations relate to BiH trade and commercial regulatory system.  Specifically, the Advisor shall:

a.	Work with the CLDP Program Manager in developing a training plan for the GOBiH;

b.	Provide advice/assistance on WTO issues including, but not limited to trade in goods (customs, matters, tariffs, licensing, Harmonized System, Rules of Origin, etc.), trade in services, investment issues, intellectual property rights, standards, government procurement, and state trading. The Contractor’s advise will be dependent upon the need of BiH officials as they prepare for Working Party meeting, plurilater meeting , and other trade matters. 

c.	      Provide assistance to the GOBiH in the preparation of documents and materials submissions to the Working Party;

d.	Maintain close liaison with U.S. and BiH Negotiators to ensure that the advice and assistance provided meet the needs of the WTO accession and compliance processes.  The Contractor will not be part of the negotiating team nor participate in the formulation of negotiation strategies;

e.	Provide advice to the GOBiH on which institutional and legal structures are best suited to ensure that WTO obligations are fully and uniformly implemented in accordance with international standards;  

f.	Travel to BiH to implement training programs and/or consultations on WTO topics; 

g.	Support other functions as described by CLDP staff, such as assistance on legislative drafting, coordination of logistics for CLDP seminars and conferences, assist in identifying officials to participate in CLP programs and to maintain relationships with U.S. Embassy and GOBiH officials.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this project/task order is to develop a listing of preliminary business contracts (leads) established by the TIC or its designated contractor into full blown business opportunities.  The TIC may choose to hire a business analysis consultant to perform market research and business planning.  Any business contracts (leads) identified under that business planning effort would then be utilized by this project/task order for further development into true business opportunities. The goal of this project/task order is to increase the number of business opportunities available to the TIC and thereby to increase the current work efforts of the various TIC business areas.  While potential customers can include any commercial or DoD entity, there is a desire to target the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. State Department for the potential use of TIC services.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add the Response Guidance for the Request for Information (RFI).
 1.	RFI Response Guidance
1.1.	Response Requirements
RFI responses must conform to the below format and provide the following information:

I. Cover Letter: The cover letter must include:
&#61607;	Company name
&#61607;	Company point of contact and telephone number
&#61607;	Date submitted
&#61607;	GSA schedule number (if applicable)

II. Questionnaire Response
The government will assess and analyze responses and may use this information to inform future decisions and potential procurements.  Please respond in the provided Question/ Answer format for each question in the RFI Questionnaire section.  The government recognizes that many potential respondents will only have information pertaining to a portion of this RFI.  However, partial information may be of high quality and significant value to the Effective and Efficient Information Retrieval and Sharing initiative.  Therefore, while the government seeks a comprehensive approach, it does not discourage partial responses.  If you choose not to respond to a question indicate with a “no response” and provide the rationale.  

The main body of the response should be no more than 30 total single-sided pages with print no smaller than 12 point.  The submissions must be in sufficient detail and clarity to provide information needed to assess your approach.  As necessary, please include marketing and reference materials in appendices.  Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later.
1.2.	Key Considerations
Please factor in the following key considerations where relevant in your responses to the questionnaire.

•	Technical capabilities: Discuss how your approach is scalable, portable, and interoperable.
•	Tools & Techniques: Discuss the methodologies, processes and products, or services, both existing and emerging included in your approach.
•	Reuse: Where applicable, discuss how your approach leverages existing and emerging capabilities found across the government and elsewhere.
•	Maturity: Discuss the maturity of your approach i.e., distinguish between existing capabilities and those not yet available on the market.
•	Cost/Benefits: Highlight the costs and benefits of your approach where appropriate i.e., where it helps you formulate a response.
•	Data Security & Privacy: Data owners/producers/managers are responsible for ensuring adequate security and privacy protections e.g., management operational and technical controls to prevent inappropriate access and disclosure.  If your approach adds value in this area please elaborate however, you are not required to address such issues.  If necessary, discuss how your approach addresses government-wide security and privacy regulations (e.g., NIST 800-53, Privacy Act).
•	Accessibility: Discuss compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards of the Rehabilitation Act. (http://www/acessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm)
•	Records Management: Discuss how your approach could simplify the activities, systems, and processes of records creation, maintenance, and use to ensure efficient and effective preservation and disposal of records. 

1.3.	Example Scenarios

To help provide the context necessary to elicit quality responses from respondents, this RFI provides seven scenarios describing various common information discovery, retrieval, aggregation, and sharing needs.  Respondents are encouraged to use the scenarios below to provide context and examples for their responses to the specific questions found in section 4 below, specifically sections 4.2 and 4.3.  In addition, respondents may develop their own scenarios to provide better context for their responses.  The following scenarios are included:

<DESC>This is a Modification No. 6 to the synopsis entitled Center Operations Protective Services, Synopsis No. NNJ05115376L, which was posted on June 28, 2005.  You are notified that the following changes are made: In the June 28, 2005 synopsis, interested parties were asked to comment on Performance Incentives.  NASA/JSC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan call Award Term. This incentive is designed to foster long-term relationships by rewarding contractors with additional periods(s of performance in compensation for achieving desired objectives at a high level of performance and reduced costs in lieu of a traditional award fee arrangement.  For this particular procurement, NASA/JSC is considering the possibility of a 10-year period of performance without further competition through the use of award term incentives.   It is important to note that Award-Terms are not the same as contract options. Award-Terms are earned based on contractor performance and cost savings; whereas, options are a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a specified time, the Government may elect to purchase additional supplies or services called for by the contract, or elect to extend the term of the contract.  The Award-Term evaluation process mirrors that of Award-Fee; however, evaluations are to a greater extent based on objective metrics. A cost gate, that includes cost incentives, must be met in order to earn additional term.  NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program. In an attempt to determine the feasibility of this approach for this particular procurement, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions:  1) Would Award-Term Incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the COPS follow-on contract(s) and why?  2) Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the COPS follow-on contract(s) with the Award-Term Incentive and why?  3) What changes, if any, would you suggest to this incentive plan and why?  4) Have you had experience with Award-Term Contracting? If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of the work, the contracting officer's contact information, and your perception of how this incentivized/did not incentivize performance.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to Linda F. Riviera, Contracting Officer, no later than COB September 30, 2005.  When responding reference NNJ05115376L, Center Operations Protective Services (COPS) Contract.	Comments may be forwarded via electronic transmission at cops_seb@ems.jsc.nasa.gov or facsimile transmission at (281) 483-8529. This modification to the synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. The due date for responses is September 30, 2005. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is	 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

May 2006 – September 2006

Maintaining the health of a population requires a myriad of expensive interventions. Along with medical care, a number of socio-economic factors contribute toward health. Given their complexity and cost, expenditures for health must necessarily be prioritized.   

Public involvement in health policy has encountered a number of obstacles.  When feeling well, most individuals find that the issues lack salience, so decisions tend to be influenced heavily by health care workers.  Patients may be frustrated by the complexity of information and rely on physicians and insurers to decide for them, trusting the services they need will be provided to them in the event of illness. At the community or organizational level, the lack of consumer understanding and involvement in policy making has been identified as a serious impediment to a market-based health care system with a solid moral foundation. Over the last 8 years the Section on Ethics and Health Policy of the Department of Clinical Bioethics at the NIH has engaged in a project to design, and use decision tools that involve members of the public in resource allocation decisions for health care and other interventions aimed at ameliorating health.

While this effort has involved the accomplishment of many technical tasks such as game design, software development, and data collection and analysis, we have focused insufficient attention on a theoretical justification for the idea that the ascertainment of the public’s perspective should lead to public participation in policy setting.
To prepare a manuscript providing a theoretical justification for public participation in priority setting for health.
The contractor will be required to review the relevant literature, develop an outline for a manuscript, write and submit the manuscript for publication.
The Contractor, working closely with the project officer, will do the following work for the project: Review literature, Prepare a manuscript outline, Write a manuscript, Submit for publication and revise as necessary
Contractor will confer on a weekly or biweekly basis with the investigator to review the purpose of the study and plan the manuscript and to review the progress of the project. 
Progress Reports – The Contractor will submit to the Project Officer a progress report every month. The progress report will include: a description of the work to date, problems encountered, suggested resolution, hours of labor and other costs expended, and a comparison of planned project schedule to actual project schedule.

<CONTACT>Fannie  Richardson, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-443-1398, Fax 757-443-1424, Email fannie.richardson@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to purchase services to assist The Navy Environmental Health Center to understand the health effects for emerging chemicals.  The Navy Environmental Health Center is continuously tasked with responding to issues involving materials of evolving regulatory interest (MERIT).  DoD has been working along side EPA, and other agencies and stakeholders. As they are identified, Navy needs to ensure that research needs and approaches for addressing health concerns are conducted in an environmentally sound manner and meet or are better than existing regulatory requirements.  In some cases, current information regarding toxicology and fate and transport is very limited or nonexistent.

MERIT chemicals may include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perchlorate, nitrosamines, chlorinated pesticides and munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or their potential environmental break down products.  MEC include ingredients in solid propellant mixtures used for rockets, missiles, and munitions, various caliber, exploding and unexploded (potentially discarded) ordnance, smoke and pyrotechnics, test kits, particulates, energetic materials, carbonyls/ aldehydes, dioxins and furans, various gases (for example, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, etc.), chemical agents (such as GB, VX, and mustard gas), explosives, heavy metals, such as tungsten, depleted uranium, and lead, ammonium picrate, nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, HMX, RDX, TNT, black powder, ammonium nitrate fuel oil, etc.

Tasks

The support includes but is not limited to:
·	Conduct rigorous scientific research/review of the literature and other information to identify specific toxicological data needed to make a scientifically sound determination and provide timely and accurate comments.  The literature review should include USEPA and California EPA sources because they may have already evaluated the chemical and developed regulatory applicable reference doses or cancer slope factors.  The literature review should also include the general toxicological scientific literature; 
·	Prepare and provide toxicity profiles to NEHC for chemicals that NEHC identifies.  The toxicity profiles generally should not be longer than 3 pages and should focus on the topics identified in the outline below as information is available, including:
o	Assess the scientific validity of available data, data needs and data gaps
o	Verify that the key studies underlying the health assessment are of the quality, reliability, and relevance required drawing conclusions about the health implications of exposure to low levels of specific chemical in drinking water.
o	Interpret and summarize the key toxicology issues and help determine the validity of the scientific findings presented.
o	Identify populations at risk of increased susceptibility/disease outcomes.
o	Derive toxicity values for these MERIT and/or U.S. EPA proposed UCMR2 new list of chemicals.  
o	Prepare a chart of appropriate toxicity values for each chemical;
·	Prepare briefing materials, Power Point slides, and handouts to present in support of technical meetings; 
·	Determine whether to recommend that the Navy agree or disagree with the Federal, EPA Regional, and/or State regulators toxicology conclusions and outline the reasons.  
·	Provide specific toxicity information, as applicable, for each chemical concerning the disruption of function in humans and animals at various stages of life.  These efforts may help to prevent regulatory bodies from issuing overly conservative drinking water maximum contaminant level (MCL) that would create an unjustified heightened sense of concern in the public and needlessly waste tax payers money in cleanup costs.
·	Review the toxicological and epidemiological research, health studies, and regulatory initiatives that will impact Navy sites
·	Review available body burden data and determine appropriate toxicity values to use for indoor air/VI pathways for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in calculating the human health risk
·	Participate in conference calls with NEHC and other parties to discuss toxicological or other information that may issues involved in the evaluation of VI sites.
·	Revise the toxicity profiles based on NEHC input and finalize.  
·	Provide NEHC (if requested) with a copy of all pertinent scientific papers and information.  

TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILES CONCEPTUAL OUTLINE
·	Chemical and Physical Information Relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments
·	Toxicokinetics relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments such as Gastrointestinal, Respiratory Tract, and dermal absorption.
·	Hazard Identification 
o	Studies in Humans – Epidemiology and Case Reports for oral, inhalation and dermal exposure.
o	Subchronic and Chronic Studies and Cancer Bioassays in Animals
o	Reproductive/Developmental Studies
o	Other Studies 
o	Weight-of-evidence Evaluation and Cancer Characterization
o	Susceptible Populations
o	Dose-Response
§	Oral reference dose (RfD) basis
§	Inhalation RfC basis
§	Dermal RfD basis
§	Oral Slope Factor
§	Inhalation Slope Factor
§	Dermal Slope Factor
·	Summary and Conclusions
·	References

The contractor shall provide the following deliverables:

1.	Toxicological Profiles for 40 chemicals including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perchlorate, nitrosamines, chlorinated pesticides and munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or their potential environmental break down products following the above outline.  
2.	Responses to Regulatory Comments regarding the development of toxicological profiles for each chemical in MERIT.

Deliverable Requirements/Performance Standard: All deliverables provided under this contract shall be passed to the Government and it shall be considered as Government owned property with all rights and privileges of its use. The work requested will often require short fused deadlines to be determined by NEHC depending on the level and urgency of regulatory interest for materials of evolving regulatory interest in MERIT. Toxicological profile for each chemical must be clearly written and free of errors. The documents shall be developed in Microsoft Word (or other IBM compatible program), formatted, and submitted in electronic format to NEHC.  This requirement shall be procured in accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures. The NAICS code is 541690 and the FSC Code is B504.   This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request For Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  The RFQ should be posted on the website on or before 6 September 2005.  This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-aside.  The period of performance shall start before 1 Oct 05.  Amendment 0002 has been issued and it can be retrieved from website: www.neco.navy.mil.  This amendment makes 20 September 2005 at 1600 a firm response time.  All amendments shall be signed and returned prior to the firm response time.

<DESC>Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require  offerors to submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services  that involve a high level of complex skill sets.  The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same  however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of 500 could  overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust subcontracting  plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses that could provide  support for this acquisition and artificially reduce subcontracting goals.   Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small business base for this  acquisition and facilitate stronger small business participation, the size  standard for small businesses in this acquisition has been raised to 1,000  employees.  This determination has been coordinated and approved by the ASC  Small Business and the Small Business Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8  July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the  Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that  this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside.  The SB  strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small  business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we  will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E  under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision).  Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award.   Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that  will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be  posted to PIXS in the next two weeks.   The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Sept 2005.  Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP. Release of the formal  RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan  06. Award is contemplated late April 06.  A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort. ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005:  Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been  added to the  library (scroll below).  Questions were received during one on one interview  sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate  posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.

<DESC>Under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the Government anticipates entering into sole source procurement with Nortel Networks, 600 Technology Park, Billerica, MA 08121 for continued licensing, patches, maintenance and upgrades to Nortel Customer Owned and Maintained (COAM) system access.  NAICS code 514199 applies to this procurement.   The COAM products are proprietary and wholly owned by Nortel.  Nortel will provide direct access to Nortel’s technical support systems, E-service Tools, and Database/case management. The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government’s minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from one source.  This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302 and under Commercial Item Acquisition, FAR Part 12.  Interested persons may identify their capability to respond to this requirement or to submit proposals by September 23, 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received on or before September 23, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Department of Transportation (DOT) Credit Programs Portfolio Management System Request for Information (RFI) Request Statement The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks information regarding existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products capable of supporting DOT-wide credit portfolio management requirements.  DOT's objective is to implement and deploy a Credit Program Portfolio Management System (CPPMS).   The credit programs, whose requirements will need to be met, include: 1.	The Title XI Program provides a full faith and credit guarantee by the U.S. Government of debt obligations issued by (1) U.S. or foreign ship owners for the purpose of financing or refinancing either U.S. flag vessels or eligible export vessels constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in U.S. shipyards; and (2) U.S. shipyards for the purpose of financing advanced shipbuilding technology and modern shipbuilding technology of a privately owned general shipyard facility located in the United States.   2.	The TIFIA Program provides credit assistance for major surface transportation projects, including secure (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to project sponsors (borrowers).  Eligible projects include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  3.	The RRIF Program directs loans and loan guarantees available for the (a) Acquisition, improvement, or rehabilitation of intermodal or rail equipment or facilities, including track, components of track, bridges, yards, buildings, and shops; (b) Refinancing of outstanding debt incurred for the previous purposes; and (c) Development or establishment of new intermodal or railroad facilities.  Desired Capabilities DOT's oversight responsibility for these programs encompasses the entire life cycle of assistance beginning with the submission of applications through the final maturity of the credit instrument.  The CPPMS must meet the requirements of DOT's credit programs whose portfolios differ in many areas, e.g. number of outstanding credit commitments, average amount of credit assistance, borrower characteristics, and risk profile.  DOT intends to adopt a consistent approach to monitoring projects across all credit programs.   As described in the attached CPPMS Functional Requirements Document (FRD), DOT is interested in systems with capabilities associated with: Portfolio management as it relates to tracking of the portfolio of agreements to support efficient and effective administration of DOT credit programs.  Within the portfolio, each agreement is to be managed from origination to close.  Tracking includes the ability to: capture agreement information; record internal and third party reviews, reports, memoranda, and analyses; and track approvals and comments.  In addition, significant importance is placed on risk management of the portfolio. Monitoring as it relates to tracking of basic agreement information as well as periodic financial, insurance, status and other compliance reviews to assess compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, continuing credit quality, financial/operational performance, and the ability of the borrower to repay its obligations.  In addition, DOT is interested in any 'tickler' system alerting people when a date or deadline is approaching and a full range of reporting capabilities related to monitoring. The system should be capable of identifying certain compliance violations and providing trend analyses of key financial factors.  Note: specific information to be tracked and monitored shall vary between programs. Customer management as it relates to tracking of customer (i.e. applicants, project sponsors, contacts) information and related correspondence. All forms of communication related to applicant/project would be tracked. Data would be captured from the application stage through the close out of the credit facility. Document management as it relates to the storage of electronic artifacts within the portfolio (letters of interest, applications, credit reports, executed credit agreements, amendments to credit documents, construction status reports, disbursement requests, etc). Document management includes structured/logical file storage, intelligent and searchable metadata, and versioning of artifacts.  DOT is interested in a paperless environment through integrated document imaging. In addition, although not covered in the CPPMS FRD, DOT is interested in a system that would also be capable of supporting loan servicing.  Loan servicing would encompass tracking of all financial transactions related to a credit obligation.  This would include maintaining accounting ledgers for each loan/credit instrument for the purpose of calculating loan balances, amortization of principal and interest, penalties and fees owed and for recording receipt of payments.  Loan servicing features would also include automated notices of payment and/or fees due and an automated interface with the DOT's core financial system to record and track credit obligations. DOT's objective is to have an integrated system that meets its functional requirements so that the user is able to have one view into the system such that, at whatever level the individual is using the system, he or she can obtain the information needed efficiently and effectively through electronic means.  However, this does not mean that all information would be physically located in the same database, but that the system elements would be linked and operated in an integrated fashion.  Further, in order to support requirements, the CPPMS should generate standard reports and have the ability to create custom and/or ad hoc reports, with a user-friendly query tool (preferably graphics-based) that facilitates reporting rapidly on any required data elements. DOT will be evaluating a range of options to meet its credit portfolio monitoring requirements, from an in-house custom-designed system to off-the-shelf software.  Further, DOT recognizes that a single product may not meet all required attributes. Submittals To assist us in our review process, please provide the following in your submittal: 1.	Description of the proposed system demonstrating how the system meets DOT's requirements.  Demonstrations of product capabilities either through web links, CD-Rom, or site visits are encouraged. 2.	Description of the technologies upon which these systems are based.  Relevant information includes the operating system, Web-based vs. client/server, database, COTS vs. Custom development, etc.   3.	Information relating to implementation approach, including the degree to which the system has a modular structure capable of phased implementation.  Please address any third party software/tools that would be required to provide necessary functionality. 4.	Information on the pricing structure for licenses, configuration, customization, and maintenance. 5.	Identification of who would own or operate the system or options available. 6.	Information on other public entities and businesses currently using the system, including references with contact information. Period of Performance Responses are to be submitted to DOT not later than October 17, 2005. Notes This request makes no implication of future work and does not represent a commitment by DOT or any of the offices within DOT.

The MC2I Radar Program Office will present a Project and Future Directions Brief to all interested parties.  Specifically, the Project Office will present the planned development and delivery strategy for the Highly Expeditionary Long Range Air Surveillance Radar (HELRASR) Program, the Long Range Radar Antenna Array Engineering Development Model (EDM), an AN/TPS-59(V)3 shelter redesign effort to address and mitigate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, and the Radar Environmental Simulator (RES) effort.  The HELRASR is the next generation radar to replace the currently fielded AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar system.

Interested vendors are encouraged to have cost estimators in attendance as anticipated future discussion may require fiscal experience.  Vendors may request a one-hour one-on-one session after the initial one-hour briefing period.  Please reply to Lisa Herbst, (540) 657-5871, email lherbst@anteon.com no later than 7 October 2005 with your list of attendees and to arrange individual meeting times.

Maximum use of advanced technology in radar development and design is highly encouraged to produce a complete system to meet or exceed the mobility and transportability requirements outlined in the draft CDD and draft Performance Specifications while maintaining and improving the performance of the Marine Corps’ next generation long range radar system.  The new radar must be built within the funding constraints outlined in the current profile for HELRASR.  This funding is an estimate only and is subject to change.

Supportability considerations should be addressed in the design and development of the new radar, to include complete support for sustainment throughout the life of the system.  Critical to supporting the system is an effective maintenance and support philosophy.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and maintenance concepts designed to reduce life cycle cost to the Marine Corps should be addressed and included in the overall design of the system.  Autonomic logistics are essential for complete electronic and mechanical monitoring of the system and is critical to assessing system health.  Supportability considerations should also address seabased logistics and integrated data environment capabilities.

Contractors are invited to read (only) the current drafts for the 3-DELRR Concept Development Document (CDD) and Performance Specification at Anteon Corporation, Stafford Operations Center, 16 Center Street, Stafford VA 22556 by coordinating a visit request in advance with Lisa Herbst at (540) 288-5475.

<SUBJECT>D -- Voice System Expansion for Pearsall TX
<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis:

1.1.1	Background

	The San Antonio Detention and Removal Office is constructing a new detention facility at Pearsall TX. Pearsall is approximately fifty (50) miles south of San Antonio on Interstate highway 35. Currently, there is no lodging available in Pearsall. Vendor should plan on having their installation team stay in San Antonio, TX.

	This facility will contain administrative and law enforcement staff from three different government agencies as well as offices for the detention/enforcement staff of the facility operators, Correction Services Corporation (CSC). The three different agencies are: Department of Homeland Security Detention and Removal Office (DHS/DRO); Department of Justice Executive Office of Immigration Review (DOJ/EOIR); U.S. Public Health Service (PHS).

   This new facility is a single story building with the capacity to accommodate one thousand illegal immigrant detainees. This structure is a single building (not a campus environment). That is approximately fourteen hundred (1400) feet long and four hundred (400) feet wide. The long axis of the complex is oriented in an east/west direction. The administrative staffs for the DRO, EOIR, PHS and CSC are located approximately in the middle of the facility. This administrative staff area is approximately three hundred (300) feet by three hundred (300) feet. The detention cells are located in pods extending to the east and west of the central office complex.

    The Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Telecommunications Office has installed an Avaya 8700 series public branch exchange (PBX)telephone system for the three government tenants (DRO, EOIR, and PHS). A separate telephone system for the CSC staff will be procured and installed by CSC for their staff. This Statement of Work (SOW) addresses only the requirements for the telephone system for the government tenants mentioned above and DOESNOT address the requirements for the CSC system.

1.1.2	Objectives

     The San Antonio DRO has procured and installed an Avaya S8710 PBX with redundant processors (high reliability). The system was installed in June 2005 and the facility is operational. The new system supports personnel with digital or analog telephone instruments and integrated voicemail. The new system has sufficient RTU’s and voice mail ports to accommodate 100 users. 

     The newly installed system currently has voice mail for 100 users and sufficient RTU’s for the sixty nine (69) telephones currently deployed.

     It is the intent of the government to expand the existing system to accommodate additional staff members. The configuration/capability specified in this SOW shall be the requirements for the expansion portion of the system and does not address the current configuration of the system. The expansion of the system capacity shall not render the equipment installed under the initial operational capability installation obsolete.

    There are underground/under slab conduits between the three server rooms. One 4” conduit runs from the DRO phone room to the EOIR phone room and one 4” conduit runs from the DRO phone room to the PHS phone room. There are no interconnecting conduits between the PHS and EOIR phone rooms. The approximate distance between the DRO phone room and the EOIR phone room is one hundred and sixty (160) feet. The approximate distance between the DRO phone room and the PHS phone room is one hundred forty (140) feet.

    The voice cabling for the DRO area will terminate in the DRO phone/server room, EOIR in the EOIR phone/server room and the PHS cabling in the PHS phone/server room etc. The government will have a copper tie cable running between the three government tenant phone/server rooms. The PBX is currently located in the DRO phone/server room and connects to the EOIR and PHS phone/server rooms via a copper tie cable. The telephone instruments for the PHS have already been distributed and no further instruments will be placed in the area. A majority of the new telephone instruments will be distributed in the ICE area with the balance of the instruments placed in the EOIR section. The final instrument count to be distributed to each of the ICE and EOIR offices is currently TBD and will be determined at a later date, but prior to installation.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a turn-key, multi-wavelength pyrometer whose expert system determines and displays the temperature, the on-line tolerance and signal strength (emissivity), spectral and total emissivity correction, and absorption/emission compensation.  The system will use a spectrometer to measure the radiant intensities as a function of wavelength to determine these numbers.  Measurement is either continuous or on operator demand.  The thermal spectrum is displayed and the raw data, including emissivity versus wavelength, can be saved to non-volatile memory for later analysis.  Instrument consists of optical input (sensor), fiberoptic interconnection cable, and console (Intel/Windows PC).  Specifications: 1.	This multi-wavelength spectrometer-based pyrometer shall have a dual temperature range of 800 – 2500C and 1500 – 4000C, accuracy of ± 0.2% for grey targets and ± 1% for non-grey targets between 800 and 2600C, reproducibility of ±1C, and resolution of 0.1C.    To accomplish these requirements, the spectrometer shall use a grating to disperse the light into a wavelength range of 500 – 1000 nanometers with the number of wavelengths being 500 having a resolution of 1 nanometer.  The detector shall be made of silicon. Along with displaying the temperature, a tolerance or uncertainty of the temperature measurement as well as a mid-range emissivity value shall be displayed.  This emissivity value shall be the ratio between the intensity of the signal from the target to the intensity of the signal from a blackbody calibration source at the same temperature as the target.  Whether the emissivity is a relative or absolute value will depend on the differences in the operating conditions between the calibration and the target measurement performed by the operator2.   The system will use one achromatic doublet, anti-reflectively coated lens assembly 6 inches long by 1.5 inches in diameter.  The focal length can vary between 6 inches to 20 feet with corresponding target spot size diameters ranging from 0.010 to 1 inch (0.25 to 25mm).  3.  Attached to this lens will be one 7-meter interconnecting armored multimode fiberoptic made of low OH silica-silica.  The fiber ends will be terminated with SMA-type connectors.   4.  One Helium-Neon low-power laser will be provided that is attachable to the fiberoptic to supply a visible spot on the target for aiming the pyrometer. 5.  The computer system shall have an industrial closure within which is enclosed the CPU (at least 1.2 GHz Celeron), hard drive (at least 80GB, 52x24x52 CDRW), RAM (at least 512 MB), ethernet board (10/100), and a serial, parallel, and 2 USB ports.	Windows 2000 Professional shall come installed.  A 15” LCD monitor shall be provided.  The industrial closure shall have 88 CFM intake with a washable filter, have the capability of providing 400W of power, and weigh 50 lbs. with front-mounted handles and be 19” rack mountable. 6.  The spectropyrometer’s software shall provide the capability to allow the user to specify the path and a unique name for the datafiles. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to use the On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above or it may be accessed at	http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=   .

Statement of Work
Purpose:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) is soliciting a proposal to install an acoustic structural health monitoring system on both WP-3D aircraft.  Data gathered from the system will be temporarily monitored and interpreted by the contractor with the agreement of the contractor to train AOC personnel to monitor and interpret data and transfer that function to the AOC within a reasonable time.  Installation of the health monitoring system on the second aircraft will be based on the performance of the first installed system.  Installations would occur approximately one year apart.
Background:  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration operate two WP-3D Orion aircraft from their operating location at MacDill AFB, Florida.  The WP-3Ds are the world's premier research aircraft and participate in a wide variety of national and international meteorological, oceanographic and environmental research programs in addition to their widely known use in hurricane research and reconnaissance.  These aircraft are equipped with a variety of scientific instrumentation, radars, and recording systems for both in-situ and remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, the earth, and its environment.  Obtained as new aircraft from the Lockheed production line in the mid-70's, these robust aircraft have led NOAA's continuing effort to monitor and study hurricanes and other severe storms, the quality of the atmosphere, the state of the ocean and its fish population, and climate trends. NOAA has monitored the Navy’s P-3 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) and concluded that the operating environment of the WP-3Ds is significantly different from the Navy P-3 fleet environment, and that the NOAA Orion’s are subjected to specific stresses and accelerations as a result of their severe weather penetration profiles.  In order to ensure that the aircraft are maintained at the peak of readiness, and that all airworthiness concerns are addressed, NOAA requires that a structural monitoring system be installed on the aircraft that can record and report on the specific condition of the aircraft wing and empennage structure.  
The system must do more than record exceedances, and must be able to report specifically when damage occurs to the structure, and then to pinpoint the location of the damage for maintenance personnel.  In addition, the system must be able to provide a record of the flight such that the maneuvers that were being conducted can be correlated to the damage at the moment it occurs. Requirements:  The selected vendor will provide a structural monitoring system with the following required capabilities: 1.  The system must be capable of monitoring the entire aircraft wing, focusing on the key elements of the P-3 structure as designated by the Navy SLAP program as specific areas of concern. 2.The associated sensors, wiring harnesses and attachment fittings must be capable of being installed on the WP-3D while the aircraft is in depot maintenance, and must be accomplished by a small team within a reasonable period on a not to interfere basis, so that the depot maintenance duration is not prolonged. 3.The system must monitor the aircraft structure continuously through the flight regime, as well as during ground operations such as taxi, takeoff, and landing rollout, and be capable of identifying damage to the structure at the precise moment it occurs.  4.The data collection device in the aircraft must be capable of storing up to 50 flight hours and be readily downloadable for analysis. 5.NOAA maintenance personnel will download the aircraft data and forward to the appropriate organization for analysis.  The analysis of the in-flight structural data must be provided as an included service, and completed within one week of submission of data.  The analysis service must also have the capability to perform a 24 hour turnaround of data if NOAA identifies a specific flight as likely to have caused damage to the aircraft.  6.The analysis will initially be accomplished by the vendor but ultimately will be performed by NOAA personnel.  The vendor will develop appropriate user software so that the analysis can be accomplished locally. 7. Any damage that the system detects must be defined within a 4 inch radius.  The specific location of the structural anomaly should be displayed electronically to the maintenance technician in a CAD drawing of the P-3 wing and empennage structure.  The CAD system must be capable of zooming in or out, panning or rotating the damaged structural part, and identifying it by physical location (i.e., wing station) as well as by part number and nomenclature. 8. The CAD system will not only be used for identifying and locating damage, but will also be used for the training of structural maintenance personnel.  The CAD system must also have the capability of graphically recording repair information so that the digital image can be maintained as a permanent record of repair and structural modification for each aircraft. 9. Although not a Flight Data Recorder with specific crash survivability requirements, the system must be capable of recording up to 24 user-defined inputs for the duration of each flight.  These inputs (i.e., airspeed, altitude, GPS position, angle of bank, control position, etc) must be capable of correlation at the specific time that damage occurs to the structure.  In other words, where was the aircraft, what were the conditions of flight, and what precisely was the aircraft doing when the damage occurred.  The goal of this capability is to be able to review flight procedures and to modify severe weather operating doctrine to minimize damage to the structure. 10. An optional mission replay capability shall be available in which the aircraft can be displayed with elective overlays that will include a geo data base with terrain features. 
Signed and dated offers must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/CRAD, Attn:  Donita McCullough, Room 1756, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106.

All boom logs shall be cut from live timber, shall be Douglas fir, and shall be unseasoned, sound and free of bird holes, splits, hollow pitch centers and short crooks.  Decay shall not exceed 2% removal of the bark is not necessary.  The sweep of each log shall be in only one plane and shall not exceed 6" in 33' of length.  The measurement of sweep will be done by placing a line from one end of the log to the other end.  Logs with sweep in more than one plane, even if the 6" maximum is not exceeded in either plan, shall not be acceptable.  Other customary industry measurement systems are not acceptable substitutes  for the above specified method.  The logs shall be 33' in length plus or minus 3".  Length is critical as this standard size facilitates replacement of individual, damaged boom logs without effecting the total length of the log booms.  The minimum diameter shall be 14" as measured with a 14" diameter circle template placed at the small end of the log.  Logs must have wood (not bark) contacting the template around the entire circumference to meet this requirement.  Since trees are not round, contractors are required to use logs with an average diameter exceeding 14".  Other customary industry measurement systems are not acceptable substitutes for the above specified method.  Maximum diameter shall be a nominal 24".  This maximum diameter may be exceeded by 10% as long as the maximum sweep requirement is met.  Logs must be float tested.  Contractor shall work with the National Park Service to float test logs and NPS will mark logs for boom chain holes. Item 2. 42 Units of BOOM CHAIN assemblies shall be 7' - 0 " in length,  "Pacific Coast Pattern", and consist of 6 feet of >-inch heat treated alloy steel chain, with 80,000 pounds minimum average tensile breaking strength and certified to be proof tested to 40,000 pounds working capacity. The chain is attached on one end to a 1 inch thick ring that has an 8 inch outside diameter. The other end of the chain is attached to a 7/8 inch thick, 3 < " X 9" toggle link, with a 3/4 inch thick, 3 1/8"  X  12 inch toggle , as shown on Drawing No. 617 - 80116. The toggle may be cast, forged, or cut from A36 steel plate so long as the toggle/link is free to rotate allowing the toggle/link to pass freely through the 4 in. diameter chain plate and log end holes.  Note: The toggle, link, and ring must exceed the breaking strength of the chain. All chain shall be proof tested to 40,000 pounds and a copy of the certification shall be provided.  Chain, rings, and toggles of marginally different sizes or other alloy materials may be used to meet current production and manufacturing standards, provided that the strength of the chain assemblies and installation requirements through the boom logs described above are met. Alternate material/hardware substitutions require the Contracting Officer's approval.  Item 3. CHAIN PLATES The chain plates shall be fabricated from <-inch thick by 8-inch square steel plate, ASTM A-36, "Specification for Structural Steel" , with one 7/16-inch hole punched in each corner of the plate 1-inch from each edge.  A 4 inch hole shall be punched or cut in the center of each plate as shown on Drawing No. 617 - 80116. Each chain plate shall be labeled with the initials " NPS " and with the date showing the month and year the boom log was made, with numbers and letters approx. 1/8" high and 1/8" wide.  Item 4. SPIKES Federal Specification FF-N-105B, Type V, Style A, 3/8-inch diameter by 8-inches long, round boat spikes.EXECUTION FABRICATION:  Boom logs shall be factory assembled prior to shipment.  Ends of the logs shall be neatly sawed and shall not be out of square with the axis of the log by more than 1-inch per foot of diameter.  Branch stubs and overgrown knots protruding above the normal surface of the log shall be trimmed flush with the surface of the log.  Hardware includes chain plates, boat spikes, and steel chain, including toggles, toggle links, and 8-inch rings.  All hardware shall be fabricated as shown on the drawing number 617 - 80116.  Near each end of the log, two log surfaces opposite each other shall be neatly notched, flattened, and leveled according to the floating plane of the log just large enough to accept the full bearing surface of the chain plates and just deep enough for the plate to be below the surface of the log, not counting the bark layer. A 4 inch diameter hole shall be drilled through each end of the log to receive hardware as shown on drawing 617 - 80116. The holes drilled through the logs shall be perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the log and shall not exceed 5 degrees of angle with each other. The maximum acceptable deviation of the hole from vertical shall result in a distance of not less than 3 inches from the edge of the hole to the water, when the log is floating unhindered in the water. FABRICATION: Access to the 8 inch ring is critical while the log boom system is in place and operational. It must be out of the water in order to replace, add, remove, or adjust the boom logs. Therefore, the contractor shall first determine how each log floats in the water. After determining the position of the log as it floats freely in the water, the contractor shall then drill the 4 inch diameter holes at a perpendicular angle (90 degrees) to the water line at each end of the log. The holes must be within plus/minus 5 degrees from the vertical of each other at both ends of the boom log. FABRICATION :  The chain plates shall be mounted parallel to the water line, with the NPS date side up. The NPS date stamping on the plate shall be rotated so it is opposite the end of the log, to protect it from wear caused by the boom chain assemblies.   DELIVERY:   The contractor shall furnish 2 pairs of log tongs for unloading the boom logs at the designated delivery site.  Unloading shall be performed by the NPS, or their agent. Tongs shall remain the property of the NPS after delivery, for future use.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. The NAICS Code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with M2 Technology, Inc., 21702 Hardy Oak, Suite 100, San Antonio, TX 78258 for the requirement to acquire Watchfire’s WebXM™ Security Module, support and maintenance included.  M2 is an authorized reseller for Watchfire and is a certified minority 8(a)company.  Due to the highly specialized nature of web application testing, the NIH Incidence Response Team (IRT) requires a secured application testing tool that can interface to NIH web scanning capabilities, including professional services to support such a unique product.  Since it is imperative to keep our nation’s medical research institutes up-to-date in this rapidly changing security posture, NIH requires a best-of-breed web application testing tool that allows for maximum utilization of the organization’s limited time and resources available to devote to this function.  After conducting a thorough review of the marketplace, CIT determined that (1) there are no open source applications that can perform the required interfacing with NIH’s web scanning engines, and (2) Watchfire’s WebXM is the only software application that can fulfill NIH’s requirement for a secured application testing tool that allows for maximum utilization of the organization’s limited time and resources.  WebXM provides NIH with an on-line risk management software to effectively monitor and report on quality, privacy, accessibility, security and compliance risks.  The WebXM security module analyzes websites by running thousands of platform- and application-specific tests to detect hundreds of types of vulnerabilities.  It incorporates sophisticated security algorithms and combines them with enterprise scanning, reporting, dashboarding and trending capabilities within the software to provide three categories of security reporting – security vulnerabilities, worst case scenarios, and custom security standards.  WebXM provides the following benefits:  (1) Automates analysis versus costly manual efforts, (2) Uses an enterprise approach to manage from the top down across all websites versus a “per application” approach, (3) Utilizes a sophisticated tiered infrastructure via a web-based platform, (4) Provides personalized dashboards and reporting, and (5) Enables enterprise database storage for scaling and report manipulation.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror’s Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a product that can perform the requirements described above. Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.   Responses are required within 7 (seven) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM synopsis No. 05-207/KDR shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO:  kr33v@nih.gov.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6546; Fax 301 402-0642.

Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors or similar terms are used in this solicitation or in an y applicable provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Provision 52.212-1, Ins tructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  An addendum to this provision is applicable; paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis  are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identificatio n Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are o pen Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  O n Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicl es will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehic le is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the v ehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to  North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  T he driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b ) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contr actor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must ent er through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), th e East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notif ied by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain acce ss to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per we ek or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issu ed for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor  shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsibl e for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaini ng a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall r eturn the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracti ng Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contra ct price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contr actor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting O fficer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identi fication badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how  long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Statement of Work Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers DCIP Area Development Plan Training Class 16 Sept 05 INTRODUCTION The Office of the Chief of Engineers through the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for providing master planning support to Army installations to include the development and management of installation Real Property Master Plans  (RPMP). These responsibilities also include providing assistance to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) and the Installation Management Activity (IMA), which includes its Headquarters Staff, Regions, and Installations. Further , as per DoD 3020. ff, the Army Corps of Engineers is the DoD Critical Infrastructure Protection (DCIP) lead for the Public Works Sector.  The DCIP role involves imbedding a Infrastructure assurance planning process throughout DoD (including the Army)     One of the prime responsibilities is sustaining/ establishing both DCIP Public Works and the Armys Master Planning Curriculum and Course of Instruction. To facilitate the successful accomplishment of this task, the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires that new course be established to provide instructions on how to complete an Area Development Plan that considers Infrastructure Assurance considerations into the planning process.  BACKGROUND Army Installation Commanders are responsible for the short and long range planning of their installations, including real property, in support of current and future missions.   Installation Real Property Master Plans satisfy a multitude of requirements.  To assist Installation Commanders, Headquarters, Department of the Army developed policy guidance for development of installation master planning.  Army Regulation 210-20 requires each installation to develop a Real Property Master Plan.  The RPMP is the I nstallation Commanders plan for the management and development of the real property assets of the installation, including land, facilities, and infrastructure.  Additionally, the RPMP documents the real property planning process.  The RPMP is comprised of  the following components: Real Property Master Planning Digest (RPMPD); Long-Range Component (LRC); Installation Design Guide (IDG); Capital Investment Strategy (CIS); and the Short Range Component (SRC).  The Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for developing and maintaining the Master Planning Curriculum and Course of Instruction and teaching master planning techniques to Army installations.  This forum includes teaching master planning state of the art training ot installation planning professionals at such venues as the Installation Management Institute, and sponsoring 40 hour training classes related to master planning. IAW with updated 210-20, Critical Infrastructure Assurance considerations are now required to be included in the comprehensive development of installations, however, and many installation planners are not trained to consider these constraints.  Further, th e installation Planning components have not been updated to address these critical infrastructure assurance issues. An Area Development Plan is a focused succinct planning product that allows for a concise planning analysis that is comprehensive but allows the minimum planning needed to make adequate planning decisions.  ADPs are used extensively by cities and towns to  master plan neighborhoods as well as consider special initiatives (i.e. historical preservation, bicycle use, etc.).   It is the intent for Army installations to use ADPs as a means immediately evaluate DCIP impacts on installation plannin g decisions. DESCRIPTION OF WORK Develop an standard training course that will provide instructions to planner on how to complete an Area Development Plan, This course will include a complete of set of Instructors briefing slides, program of instruction, and complete exercise that will e nable students to fully understand how to complete an Area Development Plan.

<DESC>Note: Please request Attachments 1 and 2 via email to Shaundra.duggans@va.gov as they are too large to post. The purpose of this amendment is two fold: (1)	To respond to vendor submitted questions (Attachment 1 and 2). (2)	To extend the RFQ closing date. Due to significant Government delays in responding to vendor submitted questions, the proposal due date is hereby extended from 2:00 PM Eastern Time Friday, September 16, 2005 to 2:00 PM Eastern Time Wednesday, September 21, 2005. Vendor Questions 1.	Does VACO have a preference for the database used for the data repository? Answer:  No 2.	Does VACO have a preference for the ad-hoc reporting tool used with the data repository? Answer:  No 3.	Will any processing be needed beyond reporting and auditing? Answer:  No 4.	Where will the new system reside? Answer:  See answer to number 7.  The production system will reside internal to the VA firewall, with a specific location to be determined. 5.	Who will be responsible for system administration after the period of performance? Answer:  To be determined. 6.	Does VACO expect the solution from the contractor to include hardware? Answer:  Yes for the Proof of Concept.  VA will not acquire hardware under this contract, only the use of contractor hardware for the duration of the Proof of Concept effort.  No, for the production system.  Production system will be installed on VA owned hardware within VA internal firewall. 7.	Does VACO expect the solution from the contractor to include software licenses for the database and the reporting tool?  Answer:  The vendor shall provide an option for the software licenses for the data base and reporting tool.  The government may exercise that option at its sole discretion. 8.	What is the anticipated award date or date range for award?  Answer: It is the Government’s intent to make award no later than September 30, 2005. However, due to delays in responding to vendor submitted questions, this may change. 9.	Is there an existing Datamart that will be used as part of this program or is building a Datamart part of the requirements for this solicitation?  Answer:  No.  Building a data mart is a requirement of this solicitation. 10.	In the “Description” section of the solicitation it states “DVA requires the services of a contractor to capture, store, and provide a Web-based reporting tool that will provide ad-hoc reports and secure access to our customers.”  In the SOW “Background” section it states “Developing a financial reporting capability will be completed outside of this particular effort using our on-site contractor and a COTS tool that will be compatible with this effort.”  Please clarify. Answer:  The VA has purchased Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) reporting system to satisfy the Department’s consolidated reporting requirements for external reporting, such as financial statements, FACTS I/II, etc.  11.	Are there any hardware platform, operating system, database management or other technology requirements and/or standards for the Web-based Data Repository and Ad-hoc Reporting Tool for FMS solution?  Answer:  Any solution must be aligned and consistent with VA Enterprise Architecture guidelines.  VA Enterprise Architecture documentation is located at: http://www.va.gov/OIT/EAM/EAservice/EAv2-1Collection/default.asp 12.	Wi l the required development software, hardware, and tools be contractor or government provided?  Answer:  See response for number 8. 13.	What reporting tools does VA currently use or plan to use?  What COTS package is VA currently using for standard accounting reports for the financial reporting capability?  Who is the on-site contractor supporting this package?  Answer:  The VA legacy financial system, the American Management System Federal Financial System uses COBOL and SAS reports.    Changes to legacy reports are performed by the Department of Veterans Affairs Austin Automation Center.  See item 11 for additional information. 14.	(1) What DB is envisioned for the repository?  (2) How many users will require standard reporting capability to the data warehouse? (3)  How many users will require ad-hoc query capability to the data warehouse?  Answer:  (1) The repository is to be determined.  (2 and 3) Initially, less than 25-30 personnel would require access for standard and ad hoc reporting purposes.  As the solution matures and more interfaces are added, this number would increase.    15.	How many users will require standard reporting capability to the feeder systems data?  How many users will require ad-hoc query capability to the feeder systems data?  Answer:  Same as above.  16.	What are the number and type of reports that must be created?  How will these reports be accessed?  Do report specifications exist?  If so, will the VA provide them prior to submission of proposals?  Answer:  To be determined.  No report specifications currently exist and will be developed by the vendor during the course of this contract.   17.	Please provide the FMS system architecture.  What are the technical specifications for the mainframe supporting the current FMS application, including hardware make and model, and CPU capacity?  Answer:  Platform	Network Protocol	DBMS	Language IBM OS-390/ MVS, CICS	TCP/IP and SNA	VSAM	COBOL and SAS 18.	Does a hardware and/or software platform already exist to support the data warehouse?  If so, what are the technical specifications of the platform, including hardware and/or software components, models and version information?  If not, is the procurement of the platform included in this proposal?  Answer:  See number 8. 19.	Please confirm the following for the interface file from each feeder system: (1) platform, (2) file type, (3) file structure, (4) file layout, (5) file size, (6) record length, (7) number of records. Answer:  See attachment 1.  The interface files are flat files with a file format dependent on the type document being passed over the interface (i.e.; a standard voucher is a widely used document across many interfaces and the standard voucher format is consistent across these interfaces).  Additional information regarding these file layouts and file sizes can be provided upon contract award.   20.	RE:  Scope, item (e) - are the queries limited to querying the data provided by the interface file from each feeder system?  Answer:  Where cost efficient and feasible, detail from source systems will be provided as flat files for input to the data ware house. In some cases, queries and retrieval of data may be necessary from the feeder systems. be  21.	What is the partial list of products (ODBC, ACCESS, EXCEL, SQL SERVER, ORACLE, SYBASE, INFORMIX, PROGRESS, VSAM) on page 4 under DELIVERABLES intended for?  Answer:  This is intended to be a list of various data forms which may need to be accessed to fulfill the queries and build canned and ad hoc reports. 22.	Would additional interface data sources be handled in the same way as existing mainframe interface data sources, including direct reporting and querying at the source as well as reporting and querying after migration and consolidation in the data warehouse?  If so, what platforms are used to support these data sources?  Answer:  See number 22. 23.	RE:  Scope, item (f) - can the VA indicate what new file types are envisioned ? Answer:  This would be based on future development efforts that are not currently defined. 24.	Can the VA provide its desktop/laptop/VPN architecture? Answer:   See http://www.va.gov/OIT/EAM/EAservice/EAv2-1Collection/default.asp 25.	The Proof of Concept section describes a much more limited scope of work than the section "Scope". Is "Scope" intended to describe the scope of the eventual production system?  Answer:  Yes. 26.	Will the selected contractor be developing a Proof of Concept and a production system or just the Proof of Concept? Answer:  It is anticipated the vendor will provide a proof of concept and a production system.  27.	 The RFP states that canned reports and an ad-hoc reporting tool will be expected deliverables. What are the specific compatibility requirements for this tool (operating system, database compatibility, programming language API, etc.)? Answer:  The tools shall be compatible with the VA Enterprise Architecture.  See number 26. 28.	 How many simultaneous users are expected to access this system during peak usage? Answer:  10-15 for the initial stage of nine interfaces. 29.	 How is the Data Mart implemented? Was a COTS data mart tool used, and if so, which one? What is the underlying relational database management system for the data mart? Answer:  There is no existing data mart for this purpose. 30.	 Is the Government expecting price proposals that include services fees as well as the licensing fees required for procuring a COTS reporting tool? If a COTS reporting tool is expected to be delivered as part of this proposal, more information will be required to price the licensing for the COTS tool, including the number of web user licenses required, the number of servers and number of CPU's per server, the number of report designer license required, and the support service level required. If the Government is expecting a complete, Firm Fixed Price proposal to include COTS license fees, please provide this information. Answer:  For proposal evaluation purposes only, offeror should propose software licenses compatible with the information provided.  Exact license purchase prices, if the option is exercised, will be determined based on the exact technical solution. Also, see answer to number 8.l 31.	 What are the various types of flat files that need to be imported?   Any specific examples.  Answer.  See attachment 1. 32.	 How big are the flat files (their size) and the time window to validate the data?  Answer.  See attachment 1. 33.	 It is mentioned that there is a possibility of extracting data from FMS or Update FMS? Can we have any specific examples to understand the complexity of the process? Do we need to write separate programs or script(s) to do this from the proposed system or will they be written/reside on FMS.  Answer:  FMS can provide an extract of the processed and accepted documents on a nightly basis.   34.	Do we need to have a history of the extracted files or is there any retention period set for the data. Answer:  Extracted files are currently on a retention period; however, analysis will be required to determine if that retention period is viable or further retention of data would be required internal to this initiative.   It is estimated the data repository will require 18 months of data. 35.	When validating the flat files, apart from basic validations, do we need to interface back with the FMS to do integrity check? If so, any examples.  Answer: No.  36.	Please provide one interface file with the field descriptions and all the related cross-reference information to do the proof of concept.  Answer:  to be provided upon award to do proof of concept. 37.	Please provide a sample of canned report formats for that interface file to do the proof of concept. Are they in tabular form? Is there a need for graphs and charts? Answer:  See answer for number 18. 38.	Who is the on-site contractor & which COTS tool are they using for reporting? Answer:  This information is not required to respond to this solicitation. 39.	Do we have to provide resumes of the candidates we plan to propose? Answer:  Yes 40.	Do these candidates require any form for security clearances? Are non-US Citizens eligible to work on this project ? Answer:  See attachment 2. 41.	Do we need to provide hardware for backups, Production Server or will DVA take care of this? Answer:  See the answer for number 7. 42.	Do you have a reporting tool already in place, if not do you have any preferences?       Answer:  No to both questions. 43.	Can this project be done offsite? Answer:  The Proof of Concept is expected to be performed off-site; however, the VA will provide limited work and meeting space as needed.

Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background Investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative.  The following forms will be provided and must be completed:  (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor Preliminary Background Check Form.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract.  To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.  At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR.  Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.  Government Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.  (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual(s) presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are to formally answer questions submitted and extend the due date for responses from September 19, 2005 to September 20, 2005.




Answers to Questions on the Contingency Capability SOO


1.  Is this purely disaster recovery or is this for a combination of data backup and disaster recovery? 
            
·	It is a combination of a daily data backup and a disaster recovery site.
  
2.  Please clarify whether or not the data backup related portion of the RFQ is for pre-existing tape backup or if the office is looking at online data backup.  We provide online backup services where backups are done automatically, electronically, and moved offsite all in the same step on a daily basis. 

·	We plan a whole backup of everything from our site to the alternate site at the start and we plan daily backups to the alternate site for the data that changes daily. Online backup is needed.

3.  If the interest is there for online backup, I need to know: 

Data volume to be backed up?

·	85-90GB

 Quantity of servers?  Are they all in one location?  If not all in one location, is there a WAN or Frame Relay, etc. connection?

·	We have 3 servers that will need to be backed up all in one location.

 	Just one Exchange Server?   Is it backed up at the database level only or at the mailbox/message level?

·	We have one Exchange server that we backup locally at both the database and mailbox/message level.  

Any database applications running on the servers?  What are they and how are they currently backed up (how are open files addressed)?

·	We are running the Reporting Suite, and Web Apps as well as the Exchange server.  There is a full backup nightly because the amount of data (or lack of) allows for full backups to run overnight.  

Retention Policy for the data?  How long are tapes kept now? 

·	We have 7 Tapes that we rotate.  2 Friday tapes, 1 Monday, 1 Tues, 1 Thurs, and 1 Mail tape.  The Mail is backed up every night as well as a tape for every weeknight.  The Friday tapes are rotated every 2 weeks. (Odd and Even Fridays)

 	How is the current backup done?  Frequency?

·	See above.

Connectivity to the Internet (i.e. T1, Cable Modem, DSL)?

·	We use an SDSL with a 1.5 burst speed.  We will be upgrading to at least a T1 in the next few months.

4.  It is stated in the RFQ that the "location/capability must be within 15 mile radius of Baltimore City...” Based on our experience of designing disaster-recovery sites, we would recommend the disaster-recovery site to be farther away.

·	There is no formal RFQ document, but this is the requirement per the attached SOW. It is the desire of FedSource to maintain the 15-mile radius for its employees. It is understood in most cases these types of facilities would be further away, but FedSource wants to still allow for a fairly regular commuting distance for the employees working at this site without causing the unnecessary hardship of relocating if possible.

 5.  Original response date is Sep 19, 2005.  Has the Current Response date been extended?  What is the Current Response date?

·	The response date has been extended to 9/20/05.

6.  Provide complete description and details of the primary site located at 31 Hopkins Plaza, Suite 1600, Baltimore, MD, 21201-2806 (facilities as well as technology infrastructure, and the details of the existing systems).

·	Currently FedSource Baltimore utilizes about 5600 SQ feet of office space. The office supports the Project Support task order program for various government agencies. The FedSource systems allow for the automated support and billing of the “Project Support” program for its numerous clients. The applications are developed on the latest Microsoft .NET architecture utilizing the SQL2000 database. There is a document management workstation that is used to capture all paper documents for online viewing. There are approximately 47 active workstations that are running Microsoft XP, Microsoft Office and use Microsoft Outlook for Email

The scope of work encompasses the Contractor to provide subscription service and a license to use Form 990PF data that has been digitized by the contractor.

The scope of work is not for transcription services.
5) The proposal due date remains, September 20, 2005, 4:00 p.m. EDT.

Questions (Q) and Answers (A):

Q.1: Is there an incumbent?

A.1:  Yes, Philanthropic Research, Inc. (“Guidestar”)

Q.2: What is meant by the phrase of "Government acceptance"?

A.2: Government acceptance constitutes acknowledgment that the supplies or services conform to applicable contract quality and quantity requirements. 

Q.3: Is this a small-business set-aside?

A. 3: No, it is unrestricted.

Q.4: Please clarify.  From my understanding, the contractor is to deliver an agreed upon Digitized Form 990-PF Data.  Why does the solicitation state that, "The contractor shall enter and verify all financial source data?"  

A.4:  The contractor shall deliver the Digitized Form 990-PF Data in the file format and delivery method to which the parties agree.  The Government is not acquiring transcription services, but the digitized data that the Government subscribes to must be accurate.  Verification refers to the processes used by the contractor (key verification, math checking, etc.) to ensure that transcription is accurate. 

Q.5: What is the quantity of Form 990-PF that are to be Digitized by the contract in a one year period?

A.5:  Approximately 82,000.

Q.6: How many Form 990-PF forms are required be data captured and processed for the
IRS in the 30 day period and are there any periodic turn-around schedules?  

Will there be any additional forms required to be processed after the first 30 days of the contact in the first contract year? 

If so, how many forms are estimated to be processed on an annual basis? 

A.6 (a): Most current year data (2004).  Since all 2004 returns have not been filed yet, it is expected that the contractor will have the process established to start providing data to the Government within 30 days after award of the contract.

A.6 (b), (c): Yes, approximately 82,000.

Q.7: What are the digital data field output specifications required by the IRS and is a publication of these specifications available? What are the digital media specifications for the output returned to the IRS?

A.7: See under Task Description.  The format will be mutually agreed to by the parties after award.

Q.8: Are alphabetic fields of data to be converted using upper case characters only or upper and lower case characters?

A.8:  Alphabetic fields should use upper case characters only.

Q.9: Are numeric fields captured with decimal dollar values?

A.9:  Dollar amount fields should be captured as dollars only.

Q.10: What is the unit of measure for proposed pricing (per form, per character)?

A.10: Per Year.

Q.11: More specifically, is this a new requirement, or is there a current contract in place for the services?  If there is a current contract, please provide the following information; contractor (location would be very helpful), contract number, contract type, award and expiration date, and value.   

A.11: See A.1 above for the contractor’s name.  A current purchase order is in place.  Location is the contractor’s site.  Purchase order number is TIRNO-04-P-00621.  Contract type is fixed price.  Award date is 08/26/2004 and expiration date is 08/31/2005.  The purchase order award amount is $41,625.00

Q.12: Under DELIVERABLES it states that "The contractor shall deliver the Digitized Form 990-PF Data within thirty days from the date of award."  To ensure to be able to deliver the data in thirty days I need to get some indication of how much data (in pages) is involved in this Solicitation? 

A.12:  Approximately 2,000,000 pages

Q.13: The RFQ requests "transcribed data from the Forms 990-PF for tax exempt organizations that have filed with the IRS reporting financial activity in calendar year 2003."  We interpret this to mean returns filed with fiscal year ending dates between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003.  Is this correct?

A.13: Form 990-PF data for the 2003 returns filed with fiscal year ending dates between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003 plus additional 990-PF data as produced through the end date of the subscription.   

Q.14: Would you clarify exactly what it is the solicitation is asking for?  It talks about the contractor providing a subscription service or license to use the data digitized by the contractor.  Will the contractor be hosting the form and collecting the data and then giving it to TE/GE?  Also, the Acceptance Criteria talks about conversion of financial source data.  What are they referring to?
Are you looking for a contractor to host the form, collect the data and provide it back to TE/GE?  Or are you looking for a contractor to tag fields on the form, extract that data and give it to TE/GE?

A.14: The contractor will not host anything for TE/GE.  The Government is acquiring a subscription to use the data. The data will be transferred to IRS as described in the SOW. The database should already exist and IRS is not involved with how the awardee stores the vendors data.

Q.14: What is the volume of 990-PF forms?
Are we responsible for picking up the forms or will they be shipped to us?
If we are responsible can we use a courier like UPS?
Is there a record layout?
Is there a current vendor doing this work now and if so what is their pricing?
Are we to bid by the form, record, keystroke or total yearly costs?

A.14: See the responses above: A.1, A.5, A.14, A.7, A.11 and A.10.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001
The following AMENDMENT 0001 is hereby issued to make the following changes:
1.	The area of decking measures approximately 12,000 SF.
2.	The list of spaces spreadsheet shall be considered an estimate only.  Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship’s designated representative(s).
3.	Offerors shall quote a firm fixed price for materials and installation for 12,000 SF.  The log tracking system established by the contractor and certified by the ship’s designated representative (identified at pre-work planning conference) shall serve to verify the scope of work, in this case NTE 12,000 SF.
4.      A word about underlayment, contractors shall expect to either install one-step decking system directly over exisiting decking system if determined 'sound' prior to work starting and certified by the ship's designated representative.  Any rip out or removal of an existing unsound decking system shall be completed by ship's force.  Again, bottom line is that contractor shall quote for the material and installation only of the one step system NTE 12,000 SF.  Any underlayment system or cove base required prior to or part of the one-step system shall count against the 12,000 SF.
