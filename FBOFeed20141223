15. Mandatory Language:   
The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is a full and open requirement.  All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.   
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.   
The Contractor is required to be "Export Controlled" certified to receive and view the drawings for this solicitation.  To become certified, register at website www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp (for guidance, go to FAQ).  Foreign owned firms are advised to contact Tina Vinson at (405) 734-8128 or email tina.vinson@tinker.af.mil before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions to receiving an award.   
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR).  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards.   
First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it.  First Article testing is waived if the offeror is the prime contractor, Pratt and Whitney.  All other offerors can apply for a waiver of First Article approval under the following condition(s): Offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar article to the prime contractor for delivery to the Government; offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Government, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Government; provided not more than 36 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.  Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<p>DESCRIPTION<br />This synopsis IAW FAR Subpart 5.2 is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for proposals. Do not submit a proposal at this time. This is a pre-solicitation notice for The Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) engineering and research activities support at the U.S. Air Force Academy, CO.</p>
<p>The Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) is located in the Department of Engineering Mechanics (DFEM) at The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). CAStLE's mission is to provide structural integrity tools, solutions and information to Department of Defense (DoD) as well as non-DoD and non-Government entities through the use of appropriate formal agreements. CAStLE also supports the Dean's mission by bringing Air Force-relevant research and engineering activities into the classroom.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform engineering and research activities related to material degradation due to aging, initiated by external customers, CAStLE, other government agencies and non-government entities. In general, the research and engineering activities performed by CAStLE cover a variety of work that follows aircraft and other structures through their life-cycle from cradle to grave. CAStLE efforts span a wide range of material degradation-related topics, including basic development and characterization of materials, mechanical testing of structure(s), material corrosion susceptibility and mitigation, computer modeling and finite element analysis, flight data acquisition, structural teardown and analysis, and analysis of damaged, failed and/or degraded structure(s) and materials. The contractor may be required to perform efforts related to the above listed CAStLE activities, as well as research activities, engineering activities, structures teardown, non-destructive analysis, design analysis/development/qualification testing, full-scale testing, certification and force management development, force management execution, training/procedural support, written reports/briefings, education, lab equipment maintenance, and other related efforts. The scope of this effort may cover a variety of aging structures (from a micro-level up to aircraft, ships, tanks, ground support equipment, bridges, and other varieties of aging structures and materials). The Contracting Officer will issue Task Orders (TOs) as the ordering mechanism for specified requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541712 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is a total small business set aside in accordance with FAR Part 19.502-2(b). It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically about mid-January to early February 2015 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web page at https://www.fbo.gov/. Due date for receipt of proposal will be indicated in the solicitation document when it is released. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates or amendments. It should be noted that paper copies of documents will not be provided. All proposals are to be submitted by U.S. Mail or by other courier delivery services company only. No proposals will be accepted by email or fax.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) or may not be considered for award. Registration can be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of electronic annual representations and certifications in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process. Representation and Certification are to be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun and Bradstreet and can be obtained at http://www.dnb.com/.</p>
<p>This is expected to be a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), DoD Source Selection Procedures (dated 4 March 2011) and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS). These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. A contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the price difference. The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. <br />5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 2014)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, <br />Kelly S. Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@us.af.mil<br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU/HQ AFICA/AFISRA/SMC ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2395, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>Destination Information: FOB Origin, Inspection and Acceptance at Origin</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 252 days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 01/09/15 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/. Solicitation number is SPE7MC15R0034</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery, socioeconomic support, abilityone and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>Eligible Applicants <p> Public Law 102-588, passed in 1992, authorized NASA to initiate NASA EPSCoR to strengthen the research capability of jurisdictions that have not in the past participated equably in competitive aerospace research activities. The goal of NASA EPSCoR is to provide seed funding that will enable jurisdictions to develop an academic research enterprise directed toward long-term, self-sustaining, nationally-competitive capabilities in aerospace and aerospace-related research. This capability will, in turn, contribute to the jurisdiction's economic viability and expand the nation's base for aerospace research and development. <p> Based on the availability of funding, NASA will continue to help jurisdictions achieve these goals through NASA EPSCoR. Funded jurisdictions will be selected through a merit-based, peer-review competition. <p> The following are the specific objectives of NASA EPSCoR: <p> Contribute to and promote the development of research capability in NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions in areas of strategic importance to the NASA mission; <p> Improve the capabilities of the NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions to gain support from sources outside the NASA EPSCoR program; <p> Develop partnerships among NASA research assets, academic institutions, and industry; <p> Contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction; and <p> Work in close coordination with the Space Grant consortium in the jurisdiction to improve the environment for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. <p> While proposals can be accepted only from institutions for which the NASA EPSCoR Directors are currently serving, all institutions of higher education within the jurisdiction should be given the opportunity and be made aware of the FY 2015 NASA EPSCoR CAN. <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) determines overall jurisdiction eligibility for NASA EPSCoR. Details regarding general eligibility are available at: <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligible.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/p rograms/epscor/eligible.jsp </A>    . <p> The following jurisdictions are eligible to submit one proposal to this NASA EPSCoR solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. <p> Agency Name NASA Headquarters <p> Description <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Education, in cooperation with NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), Human Exploration & Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorates (SMD), the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), and NASAs ten centers, solicits proposals for the NASA Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Each funded NASA EPSCoR proposal is expected to establish research activities that will make significant contributions to NASAs strategic research and technology development priorities and contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction. The program parameters are: <p> NASA EPSCoR Jurisdictions responding to this Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) may submit one (See EPSCoR Eligibility and Proposal Acceptance section of the solicitation). <p> The maximum funding request per proposal is $375,000.

<DESC>Eligible Applicants <p> Public Law 102-588, passed in 1992, authorized NASA to initiate NASA EPSCoR to strengthen the research capability of jurisdictions that have not in the past participated equably in competitive aerospace research activities. The goal of NASA EPSCoR is to provide seed funding that will enable jurisdictions to develop an academic research enterprise directed toward long-term, self-sustaining, nationally-competitive capabilities in aerospace and aerospace-related research. This capability will, in turn, contribute to the jurisdiction's economic viability and expand the nation's base for aerospace research and development. <p> Based on the availability of funding, NASA will continue to help jurisdictions achieve these goals through NASA EPSCoR. Funded jurisdictions will be selected through a merit-based, peer-review competition. <p> The following are the specific objectives of NASA EPSCoR: <p> Contribute to and promote the development of research capability in NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions in areas of strategic importance to the NASA mission; <p> Improve the capabilities of the NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions to gain support from sources outside the NASA EPSCoR program; <p> Develop partnerships among NASA research assets, academic institutions, and industry; <p> Contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction; and <p> Work in close coordination with the Space Grant consortium in the jurisdiction to improve the environment for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. <p> While proposals can be accepted only from institutions for which the NASA EPSCoR Directors are currently serving, all institutions of higher education within the jurisdiction should be given the opportunity and be made aware of the FY 2015 NASA EPSCoR CAN. <p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) determines overall jurisdiction eligibility for NASA EPSCoR. Details regarding general eligibility are available at: <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/eligible.jsp">http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/p rograms/epscor/eligible.jsp </A>    . <p> The following jurisdictions are eligible to submit one proposal to this NASA EPSCoR solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. <p> South Carolina may submit up to two proposals, provided at least one of the proposals represents a project from the U.S. Virgin Islands (which currently falls under South Carolinas jurisdiction). <p> Hawaii may submit up to two proposals, provided at least one of the proposals represents a project from Guam (which currently falls under Hawaiis jurisdiction). <p> Agency Name NASA Headquarters <p> Description <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Education, in cooperation with NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), Human Exploration & Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorates (SMD), the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), and NASAs ten centers, solicits proposals for the NASA Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Each funded NASA EPSCoR proposal is expected to establish research activities that will make significant contributions to NASAs strategic research and technology development priorities and contribute to the overall research infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic development of the jurisdiction. The program parameters are: <p> NASA EPSCoR Jurisdictions responding to this Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) may submit one proposal with the exception of South Carolina and Hawaii which may submit up to two proposals.  (See EPSCoR Eligibility and Proposal Acceptance section of the solicitation). <p> The maximum funding request per proposal is $750,000. This amount is to be expended over a three-year period. <p> All NASA EPSCoR monies must be cost-shared at a level of at least 50% with non-federal monies.

<DESC><strong>Description:<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Basic Research Laboratory (BRL) plans to procure on a sole source basis environmental consulting services for physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of environmental contaminants specifically for construction of multiple PBPK models of data derived from studies of environmental contaminants by BioSimulation Consulting, Inc., 2915 Ogletown Road, #1182, Newark, DE 19713.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541620 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price labor hour type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months; Jan. 26, 2015 through Jan. 25, 2016.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The BRL investigates the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of potential environmental toxicants. These studies are conducted in rodents with the ultimate goal of providing data for extrapolation to assess risk of exposure to humans. Mathematical modeling of these data using PBPK methods can be used for extrapolation of results between doses, routes of exposure, and species. Previously, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) selected specific chemicals for research interest for PBPK modeling. Three (3) PBPK models are currently partially completed (10%, 50%, and 80%). The requirement is for the Contractor to complete these PBPK models, and to provide comparative models of other chemicals of interest using established model methods and techniques.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide environmental consulting services, to include developing PBPK models from laboratory data based on methods, techniques, and parameters as described by Emond et al, 2005, 2010, and 2013. These models shall be developed using acsIX and/or MATLAB software applications. The Contractor shall provide consultation to the NIH Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during concept development for each PBPK model. The Contractor shall provide the following: 1) Multiple PBPK models for each chemical, based on different exposure scenarios; 2) PBPK models to support observations of a specific mechanism of action, target tissue, route of exposure or excretion, or metabolic pathway; 3) Convert rodent PBPK models to human PBPK models. The Contractor shall provide monthly progress reports of the work accomplished by email to the COR. The Contractor shall provide a final report consisting of a manuscript suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed journal at the completion of each model.</p>
<p>BioSimulation Consulting, Inc. has the requisite capabilities to finish the partially completed PBPK models due to its documented expertise in PBPK models of the selected specific environmental contaminants of research interest to the NTP. The purchase is needed to complete the PBPK models in order to maintain the integrity of the established model methods and techniques. A change would be disruptive to the research conducted to date.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00PM EST, on January 9, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 812930 and the business size standard is $38.5M.</p>
<p>Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months Feb. 1, 2015 through Jan. 31, 2016.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The NCI OSFM uses 11400 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD as swing space for NCI programs that are having their office spaces renovated. Therefore, the quantity of parking spaces needed changes.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide eighty (80) parking spots at Rockwall One / 11400 Rockville Pike, Rockville MD for NCI employees located at 11400 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD. The Contractor will provide the allotted number of parking cards with unique identification numbers to an NCI contact who will then assign a card to each NCI employee at Rockwall One.

The Neurobiology Group has generated a series of mouse lines that mode the potential effects of genetic or environmental perturbations to uncover critical periods of norepinephrine system development, and to determine the long-term structural and behavioral consequences of these manipulations. The Med Associates open-field equipment is required to record spontaneous behavioral activity as well as evoked activity induced by important experimental factors like stress or environmental toxicants. These chambers enable NIEHS to record a wide range of behaviors (i.e. distance traveled, stereotype, rearing, etc) over a long period of time (e.g., hours to day) with automated precision. Simultaneous recording of neural activity in live, behaving mice is also enabled by these chambers because the housing is compatible existing in vivo recording equipment at NIEHS. Procuring mouse behavior test products from manufacturers other than Med Associates, Inc will cost the investigators unpredictable amount of extra time and effort for testing and troubleshooting and will result in significantdelay and complete failure in the process of achieving our ongoing research here at NIEHS. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Purchasing Agent at the address stated above. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 8 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD 20892 will be soliciting proposals from small business concerns that possess the research and development (R&amp;D) expertise to conduct innovative research that will contribute toward meeting the program objectives.
<p>NIDA has an interest in understanding the consequences of nicotine addiction and promoting research into smoking cessation and reduction of harm caused by smoking. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, also known as electronic cigarettes) are recently developed devices that deliver nicotine along with other constituents and flavorings in an inhalable aerosol. NIDA has an interest in supporting research into ENDS because their use is rapidly increasing in adults and youth, and they may also represent a valuable opportunity for harm reduction and smoking cessation. The currently available research data on ENDS is insufficient to fully inform public policy or to assess their overall impact on public health. Research is hampered for several reasons, including the limited information available on the nicotine delivery characteristics and uncertainty that any specific model will be available for the full term of a multi-year study. Furthermore, currently available devices do not have the product data and manufacturing documentation required for Investigational New Drug (IND) approval, thereby preventing their use in many clinical studies. In order to accelerate ENDS research, NIDA is seeking proposals to develop a standardized ENDS to be used in clinical research. This request for proposals may be most relevant (but not limited) to current ENDS manufacturers, provided they are eligible to apply to the SBIR program.</p>
<p>The solicitation is planned to be available electronically in January 2015.  At the earliest it will be posted 15 days from this notice.  You will access the solicitation through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fbo.gov) or through the NIDA website: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html). All information required for the submission of a proposal is contained in or accessible through the solicitation package. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available ONLY via electronic means. Printed copies of the solicitation will not be distributed. Potential offerors are encouraged to check the fedbizopps.gov for updates on the program. Any updates or corrections to the solicitation will be posted there.</p>
<p>The purposes of the SBIR program are to: (a) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; (b) strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal research/research &amp; development (R/R&amp;D) needs; (c) increase the commercial application of Federally-supported research results; (d) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned business concerns; and improve the return on investment from Federally-funded research for economic and social benefits to the Nation. For purposes of the SBIR program, a small business concern is any business concern that, on the date of award, (1) is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States, which operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to the United States economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; (2) is in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture, there must be less than 50 percent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture; (3) more than 50% directly owned and controlled by one or more individuals (who are citizens or permanent resident aliens of the United States), other business concerns (each of which is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens or permanent resident aliens of the United States), or any combination of these; OR more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, or any combination of these. No single venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm may own more than 50% of the concern AND (4) has, including its affiliates, no more than 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Integrated Systems Toxicology Division (ISTD) intends to solicit, on a competitive basis for a Brand Named item, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b )(ii) for an Aperio ScanScope AT2 manufactured by Leica Biosystems. The Aerio Scanscope AT2 is a digital pathology slide scanner designed for automatic capture, storage and analysis of images from biological tissue samples mounted on microscope slides. Acquiring the Aperio ScanScope will provide quality means to maintain an in?house digital pathology slide storage program. This system will be a major resource to numerous research programs within NHEERL and potentially other centers and laboratories within ORD. In addition, it provides ISTD the capability to maintain collaborations with nearby pathology professionals who also use the Aperio platform. For example, the Aperio instrument infrastructure will allow use of current EPA storage server design  and back-up protocols engaged by the Office of Scientific Information Management. This platform maintains and furthers ISTD?s capacity for collaborations with other pathologists. The Aperio is the platform of choice for the National Toxicology Program and other nearby pathology organizations. The Aperio AT2 slide scanner has the capability to 1) perform routine scanning applications for digital archiving of histologic, immunohistochemical, and special-stain slides from EPA studies and sharing of slides for pathology consults and peer review; and 2) enhanced slide visualization, advanced image analysis, teleconferencing, digital classrooms, and image archiving. This system offers unprecedented image quality, speed, and reliability for whole slide imaging with a focus on slide safety. Fragile glass slides are never touched by the scanners, but are held horizontally in secure slide holders to minimize any risk of damage or breakage. 
It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516. The size standard for this code is 500 employees. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Procedures. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit a capability statement via FedConnect (www.fedconnect.net). A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this applied research (6.2) topic is to identify, understand, and resolve key issues associated with the operation of a free space optical quantum key distribution (QKD) system that functions in a maritime environment including the development and maturation of algorithms, protocols; and methods that resolve these issues; determine the performance of and demonstrate the capability of these algorithms, protocols and methods in order to understand their benefits and limitations; as well as to identify and provide technical solutions for performance barriers associated with supporting technologies such as single photon sources, detectors, and adaptive optics, needed to support operating in the context of a free space optical QKD system in the maritime environment.
<p>Much of the basic research effort related to QKD has been instantiated in fiber optic systems for which many mathematically derived, results regarding security and security weaknesses of the system due to imperfections of the implementation have been recognized and experimentally verified. In the context of the motivating problem - a free space optical QKD system operating in a challenging environment featuring a time varying propagation channel, absorption, and multiple scattering the Office of Naval Research wishes to accelerate the development and understanding of QKD security and the underlying technologies required to successfully operate a QKD link in this challenging environment. While research efforts that employ fiber optics provide valuable insight into the operation and security of QKD systems, the assumption of a near lossless fiber optic propagation channel with no scattering and a static propagation environment is quite different from the environment associated with the motivating problem. This environment presents different challenges regarding the security of QKD protocols, the detection of eavesdroppers, the viability of schemes to maximize the information encoding of a single photon (or packets) that exploit precise timing, and polarization due to self-motion of platforms as well as the time varying propagation.</p>
<p>While QKD is often regarded as unconditionally secure, it is known that imperfect implementations of the mathematics associated with QKD, even in fiber optic systems, leads to vulnerabilities in the QKD system. Of particular interest to the Navy is to develop an understanding and characterization of the security implications for QKD in the maritime environment, the development of protocols that simultaneously minimize leakage of information to the environment and the creation of secure networks, as well as schemes to maximize the information carried by a single particle. Additionally, ONR seeks to advance the theoretical understanding of what an eavesdropper might accomplish when the assumptions associated with mathematical QKD security proofs are relaxed particularly the assumptions associated with an omnipotent eavesdropper that has access to all of the missing information, infinite resources, and infinite time in which to operate.</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research intends to initiate a new applied research program focusing on QKD motivated by enabling a free space optical QKD link in a maritime environment as previously described. As a notional aide to identify system issues that could be addressed offerors shall consider the following motivating problem, a free space optical implementation of a QKD protocol that operates between two surface platforms located 30 km apart and that can achieve a key generation rate on the order of 100 Mb/sec.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals that:</p>
<p>i) Under Topic 1, identify vulnerabilities and potential attacks resulting from the time varying, dispersive maritime environment and the effects of multiple scattering.</p>
<p>ii) Under Topic 2, mature, evaluate, and develop the understanding of discrete and continuous protocols that could enable secure communications in a maritime environment as well as develop new protocols that are easily implemented with minimal associated leakage of information to the environment and good security properties including detection of an eavesdropper with low overhead.</p>
<p>iii) Under Topic 3, develop methods to maximize the amount of information carried by either a single particle or packet in a discrete or continuous variable protocol, respectively in the context of the motivating problem.</p>
<p>iv) Under Topic 4, investigate how conventional signal processing techniques or the QKD protocols themselves could be used to simplify the physical design of the hardware that is used for implementing the QKD protocol, i.e. are there algorithmic methods that are available that could relax the requirements for stabilization, pointing, and tracking; temporal synchronization and jitter control; propagation control.</p>
<p>v) Under Topic 5, develop strategies on to how, from a security point of view, to expand a well characterized point to point free space optical QKD link to a network that may include non-trusted nodes.</p>
<p>vi) Under Topic 6, identify any other technical issues in the context of the challenge problem to include an argument for the deficiencies in these technologies that need to be overcome.<br />Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 24 May 2010. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university. The research shall not be considered fundamental in those rare and exceptional circumstances where the applied research effort presents a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense, and where agreement on restrictions have been recorded in the contract or grant.<br />Pursuant to DoD policy, research performed under grants and contracts that are a) funded by Budget Category 6.2 (Applied Research) and NOT performed on-campus at a university or b) funded by Budget Category 6.3 (Advanced Research) does not meet the definition of "contracted fundamental research." In conformance with the USD (AT&amp;L) guidance and National Security Decision Direction 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified "contracted fundamental research," except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the prime contractor is restricted research, a subcontractor may be conducting "contracted fundamental research." In those cases, it is the prime contractor's responsibility in the proposal to identify and describe the subcontracted unclassified research and include a statement confirming that the work has been scoped, negotiated, and determined to be fundamental research according to the prime contractor and research performer.<br />Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity.</p>
<p>FAR Part 35 restricts the use of the Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts and grants made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.<br />The Research and Development efforts to be funded will consist of applied research. The funds available to support awards are Budget Activity 2.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TECHNICAL, ENGINEERING AND OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT SERVICES.</p>

<p><br />Attachment</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>MAPPING SOFTWARE</p>
<p><br />1.0 SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT. LeMay Center/WG needs to stand up a host server with mapping software that provides digital geographic map imagery on a Representational State Transfer (REST) Web Service in a closed network.</p>
<p>2.0 DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT.</p>
<p>2.1 An application to view spatial data, create, manipulate (edit) and manage GIS datasets, perform spatial analyses, create automated process (geoprocessing models), and perform tasks (such as geocoding), in support of our Common Operations Picture (CoP)<br />2.2 Ability to create, manage, and publish any custom GIS web map, application, data, geocoding, and/or geoprocessing services.<br />2.3 Web Service deployed on-premises (behind the firewall in a private cloud) on the organization's network or private cloud.<br />2.4 A map imagery repository appliance to provide terabytes of worldwide basemaps and reference layers, along with geocoding and routing services on a preloaded, network-attached storage device that plugs into the organization's internal network. The content layers and related services and protocols should be the same as those available via REST Services over the Internet so our custom applications do not have to write custom code to switch between networks.<br />2.5 A Silverlight web mapping Application Program Interface (API). <br />2.6 Hardware (server &amp; storage) will be addressed internally within LeMay Center/WG.</p>
<p>3.0 BACKGOUND. LeMay Center/WG's Web Forces software, developed in-house, provides the CoP with underlying map imagery for wargames. Web Forces was built around the API of ESRI geographic information system mapping software. WG currently connects to the ESRI Cloud via NIPR to access the underlying map imagery for Web Forces. WG needs to take this capability offline for use on a closed network. That will require WG to host a map server on the closed network. Leading industry providers (Google, Bing, and MapQuest) don't authorize standalone servers for their map imagery. ESRI is the only known provider that will license WG to host a map server on a closed network.</p>

<DESC>Notice <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice(SS)/Request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes, and is not to be considered an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No reimbursement will be a made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this SS/RFI or any follow up information request.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No questions will be taken on the SS/RFI.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  The information will be used in a Market Research Report assessment of sources capable of providing professional support services in support of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF).  Therefore, no late submissions will be considered in the development of the Market Research Report.    <br>  <br> Response Instructions <br>  <br> Responses should be emailed to Mr. Joseph Rozmeski, joseph.j.rozmeski.civ@mail.mil, at the REF by the response date listed above.   <br>  <br> Description <br>  <br> Military action conducted by units in Afghanistan and other contingency areas often requires operations by small, specialized units in austere, remote outposts.  As part of its Water to the Tactical Edge initiative, the REF has developed a WiaB integrated system prototype.  <br> The purpose of WiaB is to mitigate the logistical challenges and costs associated with providing water for the Army's small units in remote locations while diminishing the impact on local populations and the environment.  This integrated, modular system is comprised of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) components and will reduce the logistical challenges associated with water delivery by purifying, monitoring, and packaging locally available fresh, brackish, and/or sea water. <br>  <br> The WiaB prototype currently provides the deployed company commander with an integrated system capable of producing the daily requirement of potable water from fresh, brackish or seawater sources.  After both ultraviolet and chlorine disinfection, the drinking water can be distributed in bulk for in-camp use (cooking, hygiene, etc) or packaged into 3-liter CamelBak inserts for personal consumption.       <br> The current WiaB system has completed its first developmental spiral.  This spiral included component ruggedization and integration, technical demonstration, performance/safety testing and certification, operational demonstration, and initial operational assessment.  WiaB is currently undergoing a long-term (one year) user assessment by equipped U.S. Army units. Continued input from the operators will be assessed and included as appropriate in a second developmental spiral, WiaB Spiral II.    <br> For WiaB Spiral II, the REF is seeking to improve upon the

<SUBJECT>Establish a DHA TRICARE Claims Review Services (TCRS) Contract
<SOLNBR>DHA-RFI-14-TCRS
<RESPDATE>120513
<CONTACT>MARTINA DEVRIES, Email MARTINA.DEVRIES.CTR@TMA.OSD.MIL
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA), formerly TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), seeks information about methods DHA may use to improve its health care claims processing compliance reviews to identify and report improper payments made by DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors to civilian healthcare providers and/or TRICARE beneficiaries. This process is conducted in compliance with TRICARE Regulation which charges TRICARE purchased care contractors with the responsibility of providing timely and accurate processing of all healthcare claims. The processing is also performed to meet requirements of Public Law 107-300 - Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, and amended in Public Law 111-204 as the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010, which stipulate in general that agencies are required to examine the risk of improper payments in all programs and activities by identifying and reporting improper payments to the Office of Budget and Management (OMB) for publication in the DOD Annual Financial Report (AFR), and to the DHA, Uniformed Services, and TRICARE Regional/Program Offices (TRO) to assess contract claims processing performance. <br /><br />To accomplish its goals, the DHA intends to expand the TCRS requirements to include supporting the DHA by validating results of DHA Improper Payment Program-initiated focused studies which result from contract claims processing compliance reviews; healthcare data analysis and/or mining; the implementation of a new health benefit; or at the request of other DHA entities. The ultimate goal is to develop contract requirements that achieve the maximum impact and value for our taxpayers. In particular, the DHA seeks comments regarding which approaches it should consider to assess various aspects of identifying improper payments and/or developing requirements for focused studies. The intent of the RFI is to gather information from industry about commercial best practices, benchmarks or other methods which DHA may use for upcoming contract requirements. The information will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research in determining DHA's acquisition strategy and contract requirements, and to achieve its overall objectives under the Program. Specific requirements and additional detailed information about the Program are below: <br /><br />BACKGROUND: TRICARE is a DOD healthcare program which serves active duty and retired military personnel, other uniformed service personnel, and their family members. DHA is accountable for the management and operation of the TRICARE health benefits program, which provides medical, dental and pharmacy care through the Military Health System (MHS) to over 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide in DOD Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and is augmented with private sector services obtained through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSCs), TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP), TRICARE Pharmacy (TPharm) Program and Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) contracts. <br />DHA currently has a contract in place to assist in validating that its contractors are performing healthcare reimbursement determinations and healthcare claims processing services in accordance with TRICARE directives and/or specific contract requirements. The DHA TCRS contract provides an independent, impartial review of the reimbursement determinations and healthcare claims processing services provided by the MCSCs, TDEFIC, TOP, TPharm and ADDP contractors. Compliance reviews utilized by the TCRS contractor to determine whether payment, or, as specified, coding and payment, was accomplished in accordance with TRICARE regulation or contract provisions, are not governed by Government Auditing Standards and are not conducted in accordance with the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards better known as the Yellow Book. <br /><br />The TCRS contractor performs claims processing compliance reviews on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis depending on the DHA purchased care contractor's contract requirements. Quarterly compliance reviews are conducted on the MCSCs, TDEFIC, and TOP contracts, while compliance reviews are conducted semi-annually on the TPharm and ADDP contracts. Separate annual health care cost (AHCC) reviews are performed on each MCSC. These reviews are performed to support the accuracy of Target Health Care Costs and to identify unallowable underwritten health care costs under the terms of the MCSCs. <br /><br />The TCRS contractor develops a process to validate the accuracy of claims payment based on claims processing documentation provided by the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors. DHA provides statistically valid samples of TRICARE purchased care data records in the form of a list of TRICARE Encounter Data (TED) Internal Control Numbers (ICNs) listings to both the TCRS and DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors to initiate the compliance review process. The DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors have approximately 45 calendar days from the date of receiving the TED ICN listing to compile claims processing documentation which substantiates the adjudication and reimbursement of the healthcare claim being reviewed. Documentation includes, but is not limited to, the following:<br />&bull; Legible copies of healthcare claim forms (i.e. CMS 1500, UB 04, DD2642, etc.);<br />&bull; Claim-related correspondence when attached to a claim or related to the adjudication action (i.e., status inquiries, written and/or telephone development records);<br />&bull; Other claim-related documentation such as medical reports, medical review records, coding sheets, referral and authorization forms (if applicable);<br />&bull; Referrals for civilian medical care (SF Forms 513 or 2161);<br />&bull; Other health insurance and third party liability documents; <br />&bull; Screen shots of the TRICARE purchased care contractor's claims processing system;<br />&bull; Discounted rate agreements, negotiated rate(s), per diem rate(s), state prevailing fee (s) or fee schedule(s);<br />&bull; Pricing information (i.e. Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) perspective payment system (PPS);<br />&bull; Copy of Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for selected claim; and <br />&bull; Other such documents to support the actions taken on the claim. <br />Based on provided documentation, the TCRS contractor re-adjudicates the claim in accordance with TRICARE regulations and reimbursement requirements to detect errors in claims payment and or TED payment record coding. Errors are detected by comparing the payment and coding actions as indicated on the TED Audit Detail Record (TADR) provided by the DHA, to the documentation provided by the TRICARE purchased care contractor. The TADR is the primary tool used during the compliance review, and is facsimile of the TED payment record as reported by the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors. The TADR contains claims processing, patient and or sponsor, healthcare provider, admission and or discharge, procedure and diagnostic code and healthcare utilization information. Each TED data field reported on the TADR is found in Chapter 2 of the TRICARE Systems Manual. The TCRS contractor uses the TADR to record the rationale used to either assess payment or coding errors, or to approve the adjudication process of the claim being reviewed. <br /><br />TRICARE purchased care contractors are given two rebuttal opportunities to provide additional supporting documentation or provide substantive information supporting the adjudication actions. The TCRS contractor and DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors have specified timelines to complete each phase and aspect (i.e., initial, rebuttal, and 2nd rebuttal) of the compliance review process. For this reason, compliance reviews can take between 6 and 8 months to finalize. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures that all TRICARE regulation, letters of instructions, or DHA TRICARE purchased care contract modification requirements in effect at the time the claim was processed into the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors' system, are met. TRICARE manuals are available at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/. <br />The TCRS contractor manages the receipt and storage of all claims documentation to enable the quick retrieval of claims documentation throughout the entire compliance review cycle. The TCRS contractor securely stores and protects the claims processing documentation containing Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) until such time as the DHA instructs the TCRS contractor to destroy documentation for claims with no assessed payments or TED record coding errors. <br />The TCRS contractor maintains up-to-date hardware and/or software which enables auditors to group and price inpatient hospital claims processed under the TRICARE DRGs reimbursement methodology; to accurately adjudicate claims subject to reimbursement under the SNF perspective payment system (PPS); to accurately group and price outpatient hospital claims processed under the TRICARE Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS); verify the accurate coding of claims using claims auditing software (ClaimCheck or equivalent); access the TRICARE web-based Provider Reimbursement Rates and Restrictions to verify the appropriate reimbursement rates (i.e., Ambulatory Surgery, Anesthesia, CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC), DRG, Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS), Mental Health and OPPS), or any TRICARE reimbursement restrictions applicable to the claim under review. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures staff has the appropriate DHA security clearance allowing the access and utilization of Government-controlled databases (i.e. General Inquiry DEERS (GIQD) web-based application to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) and DEERS Catastrophic Cap and Deductible, PEPR Care Detailed Information System (PCDIS) and TED Audit (TA) Application) to verify the eligibility of patients; to verify the accurate reporting of provider information and correct reimbursement of hospital claims eligible for reimbursement under the DRG reimbursement methodology, and to document DHA purchased care contractors' payment or coding errors. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures that experienced Medical Review Staff at the Registered Nurse (RN) or Physician Assistant (PA) levels are available as needed to review claims involving questionable TRICARE purchased care claims decisions on appropriateness of care issues. The TCRS contractor also ensures that translation services are available to accurately review claims submitted by the TOP contractor for overseas claims.<br />The TCRS contractor reviews and analyzes special claims processing, benefit issues, contractor compliance with new payment methodologies or recent benefit changes, and brings issues identified to the attention of the DHA. To ensure that compliance reviews are being conducted in accordance with DHS TRICARE regulations and TRICARE purchased care contract requirements, the TCRS contractor conducts internal quality assurance audits to identify incorrect error determinations and omission by auditors; inconsistencies amount auditors; and any problems with audit procedures, guidelines, or operational and policy directive that adversely affect the accuracy and consistency of the compliance reviews. <br />RFI RESPONSE FORMAT: <br />DHA requests RFI responses in the form of a white paper in Microsoft Word (Times New Roman, 12-point font). Please submit responses in the following format: <br />Section I. Company name, mailing address; and the name, phone number, fax number, and email of the designated point of contact.<br />Section II. The name and contact information for the business or other organization whose views are represented in the paper if that contact information is different from that provided in Section I.<br />Section III (NO MORE THAN 15 PAGES). Please provide responses to each of the questions listed below. <br /><br />QUESTIONS: <br />Respondents should review the Background information above prior to answering the questions. Respondents are asked to draw their responses from objective, empirical, and actionable evidence and to cite this evidence within their responses. DHA is particularly interested in the findings of research in the areas of medical, pharmacy and dental claims auditing, coordination of benefits in relation to other health insurance and hospital or physician balance billing, patient eligibility and other health insurance coverage, requirements for professional credentialing needed to effectively perform compliance reviews, methods for analyzing and evaluating healthcare data or what the most effective sampling approach that can be used to identify improper payments. While some of the goals of the improper payment oversight program are directed by statute, the overall goal of the program is to ensure that the DHA is accurately and effectively identifying potential or actual improper payments. DHA may use responses in designing the future direction of the DHA Improper Payment Program.<br />DHA asks that each respondent address each of the following questions as it pertains to utilizing a single contractor to provide technical, analytical, and professional healthcare support to meet all claims processing compliance reviews performed on all DHA TRICARE purchased care contracts:<br />1. Given the Background information provided above, what do you believe is the best approach to evaluate contractor compliance with TRICARE regulations and contract requirements and payment accuracy that would deliver maximum program value to the tax payer? In particular, the DHA seeks comments regarding approaches it should consider to assess various aspects of identifying improper payments and/or developing requirements for focused studies. <br />2. What advantages would the program expect to realize by adopting the approach you described in your response to Question 1? <br />3.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: POSSIBLE U.S. CONTRIBUTIONS TO ESAS ATHENA MISSIONFOCAL PLANE INSTRUMENTS
<SOLNBR>NNH15ZDA003L
<ARCHDATE>12232015
<CONTACT>Dr Michael  Garcia, Astrophysics Division Science Mission Directorate, Phone 202-358-1053, Fax 202-358-3062, Email Michael.R.Garcia@nasa.gov

<a href="mailto:Michael.R.Garcia@nasa.gov">Dr Michael  Garcia</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The NASA Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, requests information about potential U.S. contributions to the focal plane instruments of the European Space Agencys (ESAs) Athena mission. The Athena focal plane instrumentation is expected to consist of two cameras, an X-ray Integral Field Unit (calorimeter), X-IFU, and a Wide Field Imager, WFI. The U.S. contributions may consist of instrument subsystems (hardware contributions) or contributions to the instrument calibration, data processing, software, or modeling of the instrument response (development contributions). While possible contributions may not be limited to these items, all contributions must support the development of these instruments. NASA is interested in contributions that enhance the science return of the mission and that utilize unique U.S. expertise. Responses are due: February 2, 2015. <p> This information will be used to inform NASAs program planning, including consideration of whether to competitively solicit NASA-funded U.S. contributions to the Athena focal plane instruments. A response to this Request for Information (RFI) is requested so that NASAs program planning can be informed using all relevant information. <p> Background <p> In November 2013, ESA selected the "Hot and Energetic Universe" as the theme of the second large mission (L2) in its Cosmic Vision program. The theme is to be addressed by an X-ray Observatory led by ESA, to be launched in 2028. On June 27, 2014, ESA announced its selection of the Athena mission concept to fulfill this theme (see <A HREF="http://sci.esa.int/athena/">http://sci.esa.int/athena/ </A>    ). NASA is working with ESA to define the possible NASA-funded contribution to this ESA-led X-ray mission. NASAs participation in Athena is consistent with the most recent Astrophysics Decadal Survey, which recommended an international partnership for an advanced X-ray observatory. <p> NASAs out-year budget planning supports a hardware development contribution at the $100-$150M level. This level includes contributions to the focal plane instruments as well as to spacecraft components, including possible contributions to the X-ray mirror. <p> ESA has assembled a Study Science Team (SST) to initiate the required study activities during the Assessment Phase of the Athena concept. The charge for the Athena SST can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/athena/study-science-team">http://www.cosmos.esa.int/ web/athena/study-science-team </A>     . The U.S. is represented on this SST by Randall Smith of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; Robert Petre (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center) and Michael Garcia (NASA Headquarters) are ex-officio members of the SST. <p> The Athena focal plane instrumentation is expected to consist of two cameras: an X-ray Integral Field Unit (calorimeter), X-IFU, and a Wide Field Imager, WFI. <p> The X-IFU is a cryogenic imaging spectrometer covering the 0.3 to 10 keV energy range with unprecedented energy resolution of 2.5 eV over a field of view a few arcminutes across. The Principal Investigator (PI) of the X-IFU proto-consortium is Didier Barret of the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Plantologie (IRAP), who is supported by the Centre National dEtudes Spatiales (CNES), the French space agency. More details can be found at <A HREF="http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu">http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory .eu </A>    , under the INSTRUMENTS tab. <p> The WFI is based on a silicon active pixel sensor, and covers the 0.1 to 12 keV energy range. It provides a large field of view, excellent spatial and energy resolution and maximum count rate capabilities. The PI of the WFI proto-consortium is Kirpal Nandra of the Max-Planck-Institut, extraterrestrische Physik (MPE), who is supported by the Deutschen Zentrums fr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), the German space agency. More details can be found at <A HREF="http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu">http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory .eu </A>    , under the INSTRUMENTS tab. <p> Note that any NASA-funded contributions will require letter of support from the PI of the proto-Instrument consortium. <p> ESA anticipates releasing an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for instruments and science ground segment in early 2016. NASA is only interested in responses that can meet the specified schedule requirements as outlined in the L2 call. <p> This RFI requests information only on possible contributions to the X-IFU and/or WFI, including associated ground segments; it does not request information on possible contributions to the spacecraft, X-ray mirrors, or other items. <p> Requested Information <p> The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASAs NSPIRES system (see instructions below) by February 2, 2015. The response should not exceed three pages in length. <p> The response must contain the following information: 	Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, E-mail address). 	Name and contact info for all Co-Investigators on the RFI response. 	Name of the single anticipated instrument for which the contribution is proposed. 	The date(s) on which the European instrument PI was contacted, and his response in support (or not) of the proposed contribution; it is not necessary to provide a letter of support from that PI, merely a statement regarding the response. 	Identification of any parts of the response that may not be shared with the European instrument PI (see below). 	The specific, unique U.S. expertise that the proposed contribution provides. 	The anticipated science return to the U.S. community. 	A description of the component(s) that are being provided, including current technology readiness level (TRL) and critical interfaces to the instrument. 	A description of the work planned, ROM of cost through study and definition phases (A/B1), and approximate cost from Adoption to launch (phases B2 through D). 	Any other information that might be helpful to NASA in planning its future program. <p> Material in a RFI response is confidential, nonbinding on the respondent, and will be used by NASA for information and planning purposes only. NASA reserves the right to share the information collected with the Athena instrument PIs to the extent possible, but will not share any information responders identify as not to be shared.    This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information requested. No proposals will be awarded funding as a result of this RFI. <p> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. <p> Instructions <p> All responses submitted in response to this RFI must be submitted in electronic form via NSPIRES, the NASA online announcement data management system, located at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>     .

<DESC>This notice is for market research and planning purpose only and does not obligate the Government to any contractual agreement. This is not a request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the review of the information received. The information obtained from this Sources Sought notice will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy and Acquisition Plan for this requirement. The Government will not reimburse interested sources for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.
<p>General Information</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) is seeking information on commercial sources for the Department of Commerce (DOC) International Trade Administration (ITA) Global Markets (GM) that are capable of providing a requirement to assess, revise, and strengthen position management systems and practices over a multi-year period. Specific objectives are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct a Job Analysis and create a Competency Model for the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration Global Markets (GM) Foreign Service Officer (FSO) positions. (The Job Analysis and Competency Model from 2011 are available for reference.)<br />&bull; Produce a new Foreign Service Position Classification Handbook, which includes creating new standards for classifying FSO positions. Commerce's FS grade structure consists of FS-04 through Senior Foreign Service. <br />&bull; Develop new PDs for all FSO grades/position types based on the new Handbook. <br />&bull; Classify/reclassify current FSO positions based on the new Handbook.<br />&bull; Recommend a worldwide position structure and multi-year "flow through" (number of positions at each grade) for the newly-classified FSO positions and recommend specifications for an automated flow-through system.<br />&bull; Identify minimum qualifications requirements for hiring at the entry level Foreign Service grade level. <br />&bull; Identify the variance between the current and proposed employee population/position structure/flow-through, and propose a strategy for transitioning to the recommended structure.<br />&bull; Create a Competency Model(s) for GM's Locally Employed Staff (LES) employees.<br />&bull; Conduct Training Needs Assessments (TNAs) for GM's three employee populations - FSO, LES, and General Schedule (GS) to identify training needs and fill gaps. (A CM developed under contract for GS employees in 2014 is available.) For the FSO population, recommend a continuing TNA process (standard operating procedure.)<br />The review of the classification process for General Schedule (GS) and LES (Locally Employed Staff) employees are out of scope for this project.<br />The project will consist of an initial base year plus an option year and will require the contractor to provide TNA deliverables associated with three distinct workforces.</p>
<p>DOC/ITA/GM is a Foreign Affairs Agency governed by the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Accordingly, GM uses the Foreign Service (FS) personnel system, which is materially different from the Civil Service system, to manage the FS workforce. Section 501 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 provides the legal authority for classifying positions.</p>
<p>The project will require the contractor to provide deliverables associated with three distinct workforces: Foreign Service Officers, Locally Employed Staff, and General Schedule Staff.</p>
<p>Vendors are encouraged to provide estimated costs or pricing information for the services, which they can provide, within their response. Include any other relevant information that is not listed above, which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.<br />TIMELINE: NIST anticipates issuing a Request for Proposals for the services no later than the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 (first quarter of calendar year 2015), and awarding a Purchase Order for the system no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 (third quarter of calendar year 2015).</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541612-HUMAN RESOURCES CONSULTING SERVICES, as those domestic sources having $15 million. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that have a COTS system are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to monica.brown@trade.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The statement of capabilities should include:</p>
<p>1. Firm name, address, e-mail, telephone and fax numbers</p>
<p>2. Small business certification - 8(a), HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran or Women-owned.</p>
<p>3. Applicable contract vehicles (i.e. DOC, GSA, NASA SEWP) available for Government-wide use.</p>
<p>4. Past Experience - describe your experience of similar type, size and complexity to that which is the subject of this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>5. Provide a listing of three (3) most recent projects your firm has performed.</p>
<p>6. Your firms Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)</p>
<p>7. System for Award Management (SAM) registered NAICS Codes.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD, Office of Acquisitions 6701 Rockledge Drive RKL2/6209 MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD, 20892-7902, UNITED STATES<br /><br />Introduction <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is for all interested businesses. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Healthy Communities Study, being conducted since August of 2010, assesses the associations between characteristics of community programs/policies and BMI, diet, and physical activity in elementary and middle school children, including communities that have a high proportion of African American, Latino, and/or low income residents. In addition to cross-sectional data, the HCS includes retrospective data on both BMI and community programs and policies. The retrospective BMI data is critical because the HCS will be able to assess longitudinal associations between BMI and childhood obesity programs and policies as these programs unfolded within communities over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The analyses, publication, and presentation of the longitudinal data will require additional funding because of the complex relationships between children's BMI trajectories and community programs and policies over time. Without the additional funding, the study cannot complete analyses of the longitudinal medical record and community data.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to clean and analyze longitudinal all of the community programs and policies and BMI data (from medical record abstraction) and develop a manuscript for publication and presentation.</p>
<p>Specific work being conducted:</p>
<p>1. Clean the longitudinal BMI data obtained from the medical records,<br />2. Conduct analyses to assess the relationships between the longitudinal community program and policy data and the longitudinal BMI data,<br />3. Develop a manuscript for publication based upon the longitudinal data, and<br />Present the findings from the longitudinal analyses at an obesity-related conference.</p>
<p>Capability Statement</p>
<p>Interested businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contract Specialist. The capabilities statement must specifically address each project requirement separately.

<p>The anticipated period of performance includes a base period of 12 months and 4 one-year options for a total performance period of 5 years. The anticipated start date is 26 March 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE</strong></p>
<p>The contract type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or Seaport-e Task Order with Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Term (LOE) CLINs. The total LOE is estimated at 800,840 man-hours (based on 1,920 hours per year) with up to 31,585 overtime man-hours over a period of five years. These services shall be performed on-site (90%) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, MD and off-site at the contractor's facility (10%).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>A Draft SOW (including projected labor categories &amp; personnel qualifications) and Draft projected Level of Effort are attached for review. Please note these documents are subject to change.</p>
<p>Feedback from industry is being sought on the SOW, and suggestions/recommendations on CLIN structure for the basic contract award. If your company has any questions about the structure of the SOW, or areas that may need further definition, please also identify those in your response.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance. Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business' General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost. The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14. If your company is a joint venture, please note that Seaport-e does not permit Joint Ventures. As can be seen from the most recent rolling admissions RFP, N00178-14-R-4000, under "Additional Instructions to Offerors" in Section L, paragraph 3.11 states that "proposals submitted by Joint Ventures will not be considered for award." Because Joint Ventures are not permitted for award of basic contracts within Seaport-e, please instead specify that you are a joint venture in your capability statement and state that your preferred contracting method is outside Seaport-e. Joint ventures should also be aware that the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Since at least a portion of the resultant contract will be on a cost-type basis, the successful awardees will also be required to have a Government approved accounting system upon contract award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUBMITTAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in the attached SOW. This documentation must address, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<p>1. What type of work has your company performed in the past in support of the same or similar requirement?<br />2. Can or has your company managed a task of this nature? If so, please provide details.<br />3. Can or has your company managed a team of subcontractors before? If so, please cite contracts and teaming arrangement.<br />4. What specific technical skills does your company possess which ensures capability to perform the tasks?<br />5. If you are a small business, provide an explanation of your company's ability to perform at least 50% of the tasking described in this SOW for the base period as well as the option periods. <br />6. Provide a statement including current small/large business status and company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office locations, CAGE code, DUNS number, etc. <br />7. Respondents to this notice must also indicate whether they are a large business or qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.<br />8.

<DESC><p><br />SHELTER CARE FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Program Support Center (PSC) are seeking a qualified business to perform the following requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the ACF Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) obtain information about sources capable to provide services to unaccompanied children during an influx.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. HHS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>This Notice is issued solely for information and market research purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. Furthermore, those who respond to this Notice should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission. This Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. ORR is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this Notice. All costs associated with responding to this Notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Section 462, transferred responsibilities for the care and placement of unaccompanied children from the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since then, ORR has incorporated child welfare values as well as the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorization acts, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement provides temporary shelter care and other related services to unaccompanied children in ORR custody. Shelter care services begin once ORR accepts a child for placement and ends when the minor is released from ORR custody. Shelter care and other related services are provided in the least restrictive setting appropriate for the child's age and special needs. This Notice is to identify potential offers capable of providing services required to support a temporary influx of unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>In preparation for future influxes of unaccompanied children, ORR seeks information that it may use to develop options for contract surge capacity to shelter and care for these children on a time-limited and expandable basis as needed. Due to the nature of unaccompanied children arrivals, ORR seeks sources for a contract vehicle that is flexible, cost-efficient, and could provide the following services on a regional basis throughout the United States:</p>
<p>1) Staffing<br />2) Wrap-Around Services<br />3) Temporary Structures<br />4) Training and Technical Assistance (T&amp;TA)<br />5) Transportation</p>
<p>No decisions have been made about the need for surge capacity in 2015, or whether or not contracts would be awarded for each of these elements. The purpose of this Notice is solely to identify possible sources to the agency in the event of a future influx of children.</p>
<p>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>ORR requests information that it may use to develop options for indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide for an indefinite quantity of the specified services for a fixed time. The potential competition and award of a five-year (base year plus four option years) IDIQ contract could provide comprehensive surge capabilities for future influx of children and should provide for appropriate cost/pricing arrangements by the award of task order for services on an as-needed basis. Cost/pricing arrangements should provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (e.g., estimated number of labor hours) and would be funded in full at the time of the task award. A contract may cover one or more of the five categories. The initial award of the base year contract and each option year would require a minimum amount of funding for the development of service infrastructure.</p>
<p>The staffing and wrap around services, identified on a regional basis, could support surge locations. The T&amp;TA contract could support these surge sites as well as surge or new providers so that these sites are in full compliance in terms of fulfilling the mission and goals of ORR. Finally, the transportation contract could support releases to his or her sponsor by coordinating travel at a national level for all release and transfer of children.</p>
<p>Specifically information is sought for the following services. Responses to this notice should illustrate capabilities related to one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Staffing</p>
<p>The purpose of the staffing contract would be to provide staffing services at ORR-identified shelter locations to provide the management, supervision, and required services to children. Staff support is defined as formal and informal services provided to ensure children's safety and care. The contractor would provide all positions identified and described in the Statement of Work, including licensed professionals, program management staff, and supervision of daily operations. The contractor would provide all logistical support for the travel and equipment needed to fulfill the requirements under the Task Order (s). The contractor would provide scalable staffing plans to serve 100 - 2,500 children with ramp-up and draw-down capabilities.</p>
<p>Wrap-Around Services</p>
<p>The purpose of the wrap-around services contract would be to provide all support services at ORR-identified shelter locations. The mission would include feeding, cleaning, maintenance and facility preparation, clothing, linens and laundry, transportation, recreational equipment, security, hygiene kits, medical supplies, and custodial services. Depending on the needs of the facility, wrap-around services could include portable toilets and hand washing stations, mobile trailers for offices. Security services would include unarmed security guards and any equipment, such as closed-circuit television networks and communication devices as directed by the government. Maintenance and facility preparation services could include fencing for the property, painting and building repairs, industrial cleaning, addressing non-ADA compliance factors, and other preparations needed to accommodate the sheltering of children in the facilities.</p>
<p>Temporary Structures</p>
<p>No decisions have been made regarding the need for surge capacity in 2015, but ORR is exploring options available should the need arise. The purpose of the temporary structures with staffing and services is to identify agencies capable of standing-up soft-sided structures, trailers, or other temporary structures that could shelter 100-2,500 children on federally leased or owned land. These agencies would be responsible for the building maintenance and all services to the building, including electricity and plumbing.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Under normal, steady state operations, a sponsor is required to pay any transportation costs associated for the child to travel from the shelter to the sponsor's location. During an influx of children, ORR may waive the requirement for sponsors to arrange travel and associated costs of releasing the children from the shelter and place with the sponsor. In these instances, ORR seeks information regarding a national transportation contractor to make travel arrangements for children in ORR standard shelters and temporary surge facilities. The travel contractor would be responsible for purchasing transportation, including flights, trains, buses, and car rentals, for the children and an escort, if applicable, to release the child.</p>
<p><br />Training and Technical Assistance</p>
<p>The mission of ORR is to provide unaccompanied children with a safe and appropriate environment while providing the highest quality of care that is client-focused and maximizes the child's potential both in-care and once released to a sponsor. As part of this mission, ORR focuses on identifying and releasing the child to a sponsor while the child is in immigration proceedings. In order to effectively stand-up temporary surge shelters, ORR is seeking information regarding a training and technical assistance provider to train staff. The training would include ORR policies and procedures, completing sponsor packets, use of the ORR web-based database, and implementing best practices to provide high quality services to the children. While this contract would be primarily targeted towards temporary surge facilities, in fiscal year 2014, ORR awarded nearly 22 new grants to shelter providers and could request the training and technical assistance provider to work with new grantees which operate standard shelter beds.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT</p>
<p>ORR is seeking sources capable of providing the services outlined above, including regions which could be served, cost/pricing estimates, length of time needed to become operational, and number of children able to serve.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SOUGHT AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>All inquiries to this Notice must be in writing to linda.jules-o'neil@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO LIMIT COMPETITION
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to limit competition statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.<br /><br />The Reference Number is N6889815RCBG825. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intends to award a limited source contract to provide passenger shuttle bus transportation service for Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) personnel at Joint Base Charleston Weapon Station.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to solicit and limit competition to those vendors listed under the DoD Approved Carrier list for Military Bus Program https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bus.cfm .</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with limited sources (see above). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the limited source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:<br />(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Limited source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide passenger shuttle bus transportation service for Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) personnel at Joint Base Charleston Weapon Station.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) Limited sources is capable of providing services.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The Defense Travel Regulation 4500.9 Ch. 104 "DoD" entities arranging charter bus service must ensure that only DoD - approved carriers are considered only.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: GSA advantage and SAM were queried for sources to discover any approved vendors under the DoD - approved carriers. IAW FAR 5.102, this limited source notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov).</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on comparison of similar services from GSA schedules and other open market sources.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of GSA schedules and open market sources yielded similar services with comparable pricing; however none of the service providers in the areas revealed that they are not listed under the DoD Military Bus Carriers Program.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: The Defense Travel Regulation 4500.9 Ch.104 lists the DoD approved bus carriers, no other source approved to provide services.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Several GSA schedules were found for similar services; however none were listed under the approved DoD Military Bus Carriers Program.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />Continue to monitor the DoD Regulations verifying any changes that will open opportunities for other vendors.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Address questions to Douglas Lembo, Contract Specialist, at (843) 963-5162, fax (843) 963-5183, email douglas.lembo.2@us.af.mil or Jacqueline Brown, Contracting Officer, Phone (843) 963-5857, email Jacqueline.brown.1@us.af.mil</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE LINE ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.

1.1.2	To arrive at the Best Value decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation of past performance, Technical and Price, with Technical and Past Performance being of equal weight, but when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  While the Government and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process.

2. 	EVALUATION FACTORS AND BASIS FOR AWARD:

	2.1. 	Evaluation factors are Technical considerations and Past Performance, which are of equal weight, but when combined are significantly more important than cost or Price. The evaluation process is as follows:

		2.1.1. 	The Government will evaluate and rate an Offeror's Technical proposal using a color rating that combines technical merit and proposal risk.

		2.1.2. 	The Government will evaluate the Offeror's Past Performance using descriptive adjectives that most accurately define the evaluators confidence of the Offeror's performance risk considering each sub-factor identified in this section.  	

		2.1.3. 	The Government will evaluate the reasonableness and realism of the total projected price for the offer, and assign a reasonable or unreasonable rating to the price of the offer.

3.	TECHNICAL EVALUATION

	3.1. 	The evaluation of each quote will evaluate and measure the ability of the Offeror to effectively produce and deliver Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for use by staff for training purposes and emergency response to infectious diseases like Ebola.

		3.2.2	 All quotes and quote information are considered confidential and will not be shared with anyone outside the evaluation team.  Any questions or concerns should be addressed to the Contracting Office's POC: Jonathan Charles; e-mail: jonathan.charles@va.gov

	
	3.3.	TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTOR RATINGS:

		3.3.1. 	The technical rating reflects the degree to which the proposed approach meets or does not meet the minimum performance or capability requirements through an assessment of strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks of an offer. The Government will rate an Offeror's Technical acceptability through a factor level using a color rating that combines technical merit and proposal risk considering all subfactors. 

Color	Rating	Evaluation Criteria
Blue	Outstanding 	Offer meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Purple	Good	Offer meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.  
Green	Acceptable	Offer meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. 
Yellow	Marginal	Offer does not clearly meet requirements and has not indicated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Red	Unacceptable	Offer does not meet requirements. Offer is unawardable. 

4.	PAST PERFOMANCE EVALUATION

	4.1 	The Past Performance Evaluation will consider if an Offeror is on the Excluded Parties List located on the System for Award Management (SAM) website https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM?portal:componentId=7d526634-bb8c-40f9-a579-7061ad3477ac&portal:type=action&interactionstate=JBPNS_rO0ABXc0ABBfanNmQnJpZGdlVmlld0lkAAAAAQATL2pzZi9uYXZpZ2F0aW9uLmpzcAAHX19FT0ZfXw** . 

5.	PRICE EVALUATION

	5.1	The Government evaluation team will conduct a Price evaluation of each Offeror's submission.  Since solicitation is being competed amongst Federal Supply Schedules and as such the price schedules have already been determined "Reasonable" the purpose of this evaluation will be to allow the Government to consider a higher price as long as it is commiserate with added value. Conversely, it allows the Government to consider a lower price which is commiserate with a lower value.

(See 29 CFR 4.174) THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension<br />plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.<br />Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the<br />basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200043 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-79 effective 15 December 2014.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following part:

VAVLE, HYDRAULIC REL
P/N: L95H06203
NSN: 4820-14-488-9510
QTY: 30 EA
MFGCD: F0422
RDD: 7/17/2015

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Zodiac Intertechnique Fuel & Inerting Systems (Cage Code F0422).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  
Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on USCG aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>SECTION C1</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>C1.1 SCOPE. The Cherry Point Windsock, hereafter the Windsock, is the authorized, unofficial publication of Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina (MCAS Cherry Point). As such, its contents do not necessarily reflect the official views of, nor constitute an endorsement by, the Department of Defense (DoD). The Windsock is a civilian enterprise (CE) newspaper, published by a CE contractor (hereafter referred to as the "Publisher") under contract with MCAS Cherry Point. As such, the Windsock contains advertising sold by the Publisher, and may contain supplements or inserts. The Publisher sells advertising to cover costs and secure earnings. Other advertising provisions are contained in this Statement of Work (SOW). The Publisher also provides personnel to aid and support the Windsock staff to support newspaper operations as stipulated in this SOW. The Windsock is published 50 times per year with a circulation of 11,500. It is a key medium in the Commander's internal information program and is used to communicate mission-essential information to members of the command, including Marines, Sailors, civilian employees, and family members. A typical issue of the Windsock contains most, if not all, of the following elements: command, Marine Corps and Department of Defense news/features, Commander's comments; letters to the editor; editorials; commentaries; features; sports; entertainment items; Marine Corps Community Services news and announcements; installation and local community news briefs and announcements; photography; line art and classified advertisements. The Publisher may provide material for use in the newspaper if approved by the Commander, or Public Affairs Officer (PAO) as the Commander's representative. All editorial content used in preparing the Windsock, whether used in an issue of the newspaper or not, is the property of the Marine Corps. The PAO provides oversight and final approval authority for all editorial and advertising content of the paper.</p>
<p>C1.1.1 The Contractor shall prepare, produce, publish and distribute at weekly intervals, a CE newspaper, to be known as The Windsock and its website, barring national catastrophe or failure to adhere to editorial and pictorial deadlines by the Government. This publication shall comply with all applicable provisions of the:</p>
<p>&bull; Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5120.4 (16JUN97), <br />&bull; DoD Direction 5122.10 (21NOV2000), <br />&bull; Department of Navy (DoN) rules and regulations, Marine Corps Publication and Printing regulations (MCO 5720.74); <br />&bull; and SecNavInst 5720.44C.</p>
<p>Upon request, copies of the above references will be made available to the Contractor by PAO.</p>
<p>C1.2 Concept. To have a responsible firm publish the Windsock newspaper using copy collected and laid out entirely by the Publisher. Publisher will gather copy from standard sources, including but not limited to: Defense Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS), Marines.mil, articles provided by PAO, local news sources (for off-base events), base organizations such as Marine Corps Community Services, Joint Safety Office, Chaplain's Office, Chow Hall, Single Marine Program, and others designated by the PAO. Priority for story publication will be determined by the PAO, but generally will be laid out by the Publisher in the following order: local (on-base) news including news briefs, local (on-base) features, local (on-base and regional) announcements, Corps-wide news and features, especially those that might be of interest to local Marines. Publisher will design and lay out all pages in accordance with the Editors' SOP, which will be provided by the PAO. PAO will have oversight and final decision on all copy and design layouts.</p>
<p>C1.2.1 To enhance the quality of life for military and civilian personnel serving and living at Cherry Point by providing news and information that is informative, educational and entertaining.</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

Period of Performance:  February 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015        
Agreement:	

1.	Scope of Work:  This contract reflects the tasks associated with the bioinformatics support for the VA VISN 5 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) research investigators. The vendor will 1) create data elements for research studies; 2) create acceptable data forms for data collection utilizing a paper or web based system; and 3) maintain the HIPAA compliant database(s) for data related to all MIRECC Investigator research projects.

2.	Background: The MIRECC research investigators must have a system and process to collect and store research participant data.  This process and the database was created through an earlier contract/agreement with the University of Maryland, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Bioinformatics Core (BC) who now maintains active ongoing MIRECC research data in a database.  

3.	Objectives:  This Statement of Work describes data collection, database creation and management services defined as follows:
  
a.	Creation and maintenance of study specific data dictionary to include naming conventions, definitions and ranges for data dictionary items;
b.	Implementation of the database will include development of relational data tables to accommodate each data component;
c.	Ensure the full capability of entering data thru a web based or paper system (TeleForm Application, Redcap, etc.) to scan, review, validate, edit, and approve data items prior to entry into the system; 
d.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant de-identified database server, its operating system and software related to the system;
e.	Maintain strict standards for granting users access to its servers and systems.  


4.	Work Requirements:  The contractor shall perform the following functions:

a.	 Maintenance of study database- 
i.	The vendor will maintain the HIPAA compliant database(s) for data related to all MIRECC Investigator research projects which will include the following tasks:
1.	The vendor will create a data dictionary that provides details about each data item and acceptable ranges and limits of these items. These items will be in a format suitable to provide adequate documentation for the MIRECC staff to develop reports or conduct data analyses. The MIRECC staff will provide naming conventions, definitions and ranges for data dictionary items to the vendor staff, if available. If no definitions are available, the vendor will develop these after consultation with MIRECC personnel.
2.	The implementation of the database will include development of relational data tables to accommodate each data component. The vendor will set up a link that will allow Statistical Analysis System (SAS), Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Excel or Access to directly access read only, de-identified study data from the database to MIRECC staff who have been granted rights by the Principle Investigator (PI) or Co-PI. The MIRECC PI or Co-PI will determine who has access to this link and then provide the vendor with documentation (form provided by the vendor) of HIPAA and VA training compliance. The vendor will create views such that identified MIRECC staff will have read rights to de-identified data pertaining to each study according to the roles that are set for study personnel. Study personnel roles will be determined by the Principal Investigator for each study. 
3.	Specifically for each project, the vendor will create views such that the MIRECC staff may access specific data sets that are held in the database via software specifically created by the vendor. The interface will have unique components in consultation with VA regulations and HIPAA compliant security.
4.	The vendor will attend information exchange meetings as needed. MIRECC staff will contact any outside data coordination centers directly for specifications of data management requirements or regulations for this project. The MIRECC staff will be responsible for informing the vendor staff of these specifications. 
5.	The vendor staff will be available by appointment to any authority identified by MIRECC staff for audit of the study database.

The MIRECC staff will be responsible for having access to IBM compatible computers, with a minimum of Windows XP operating system.
2.	The vendor will be available during normal working hours (8:00am to 4:30pm) to assist MIRECC staff with operational issues. In the event that the system becomes inoperable, the vendor will investigate and repair problems in the system at no cost to the VA. 
3.	The vendor will also provide the ability to view an electronic image (which can be printed for source document) of the data collection forms to help resolve errors or problems. The vendor will provide these if MIRECC staff do not have the appropriate equipment. 

b.	Data - The MIRECC data stored in the database shall not contain any of the 18 HIPPAA Protected Health Information (PHI) elements, nor any other data that can be construed as identifiable singularly or in conjunction with other variables.

The vendor will perform quality control procedures to test the accuracy of the first 10 records of each new table to verify that the data is going in correctly. If the MIRECC staff responds with corrected data via QC reports, the vendor will implement the corrections bringing the error rate closer to 0%.

d.	Systems Support - The vendor  staff will also provide the following support:
i.	House and provide internet-based access to the de-identified database for MIRECC staff;
ii.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant de-identified database server, its operating system and software related to the system;
iii.	Maintain the HIPAA compliant study database, implement user accounts, and maintain daily database backups;
iv.	Provide access to MSQL Server and MySQL tools needed to support the above information management functions;
v.	Provide access to a central TeleForm server that will digitize and verify data entered at a web page, sent by fax, or paper forms and send this data to the database;
vi.	Provide a contact during normal working hours that will be able to troubleshoot problems in the system and bring the system back on line, if necessary; and
vii.	Provide access to periodic reports (Excel spreadsheets) on the accumulation of records in a table at intervals determined by the MIRECC investigator or staff.

e.	The vendor agrees to provide a high standard of professional service and perform the aforementioned tasks within the time and funds available for the center. The vendor also agrees to maintain, as confidential, all information furnished by MIRECC staff and designated as such, except for any information that is already in the public domain.

f.	Quality Standards - The vendor will maintain strict standards for granting users access to its servers and systems.  

i.	A user will be granted an account in the research database and access to a particular protocol only through written authorization of the principal investigator (PI) for the study, or their designated administrator.  Every PI or administrator maintains full control over the list of users and roles in the database related to their protocol.  
ii.	The research database will use Oracle 10 g database management system (DBMS) and reside on a secure server behind a firewall in a special HIPPAA user's zone.  Backups will be made daily and each month a backup tape will be stored in a secure off-site location.
iii.	Security measures to prevent unauthorized access, including mandatory periodic password changes and automatic logoff from inactive connections will be part of the system.
iv.	All changes to data collected on the study forms will be restricted to specific personnel.  An audit log will be maintained which contains the previous value, the new value and the reason for the change.  

5.	Description of Tasks and Associated Deliverables - 

a.

<DESC><p>Clarification Questions, FA2517-10-T-6028<br /><br />1. In the current system, are all 6 libraries in one union database or are there 6 separate databases representing the holdings for each individual library?</p>
<p>We are unable to discuss the current system; however, our requirement would be six separate catalogs.<br /><br />2. Do you want a Union Catalog where all 6 libraries are working in one main database or do they want to have 6 separate catalogs that are all searchable by each other?</p>
<p>Six separate catalogs that are searchable by each other. Refer to paragraph 1.0 and 1.1.1.</p>

<p>EBSCO host is purchased by the Centralized Library Service (AFLIS)and all<br />AFSPC libraries currently have access</p>
<p>4. How much data conversion is expected a part of the contract?<br />Without reviewing sample data we can only estimate the data conversion<br />services that would apply.</p>

<p>10. Will demonstrations be required prior to the final decision being made<br />and the contract awarded?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>11. Are high security protections required such as IP authentication and<br />SSL encryption?</p>
<p>Patron privacy information must be secured. Also, refer to para 1.1.1 of the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>12. Data conversion can encompass just the catalog records or everything<br />in the current system including checkout history, serials subscriptions,<br />vendor records, order records, payment history, routing, claiming, etc. so<br />the more we understand about what is expected the more accurate our offer<br />will be.</p>
<p>Data will consist of all information to include circulation history, serials, patron history and catalog, and catalog records.</p>
<p><br />13. Does HQ AFSPC prefer one consolidated database or separate<br />databases for each library, which can be accessed by staff and base users?</p>

<p>18. Does HQ AFSPC have a previously negotiated low rate of air travel<br />which would be available to Softlink training staff? If yes, how much are<br />the rates from Denver, Colorado?

<p>No. Travel is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>19. Will (hotel or other)housing for the trainer be supplied on bases<br />during the training sessions? Are there any charges for that during the<br />training period?<br /><br />No. Travel is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>20. Is there a preferred order for implementation of the six libraries<br />or is that determined by the company providing the ILS software?</p>
<p>General libraries first and then technical.</p>
<p>21. What format is the data in?</p>
<p>CSV file</p>
<p>22. What is the size of the current database file(s)?</p>
<p>The entire application is currently running at approximately 15 GB. The data alone looks to be around 6 GB, but this is based on the current storage database. Size will differ based on format.</p>
<p>23. Will the govt receive one file or several files of data, once we request the information be delivered? Is so, what type of files.</p>

<p><strong>Government Evaluation:<br /></strong>The Government will award a contract to the <em>lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror</em> whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Capability:</span> In order to be considered technically capable offerors must make clear their capability to meet the requirements in the statement of work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of capability to maintain and repair fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, pre-reaction systems, or fire extinguishers will make the offer technically unacceptable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Lack of experience with Siemens fire products will make the offer technically unacceptable and ineligible for award. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A lack of demonstrated ability to meet the required 2 hour emergency response time will make the offeror technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span> The Government will verify the offeror demonstrated minimum 3 years' experience in maintaining fire protection systems of a similar size (or larger) than those contemplated under this combined synopsis/soliciation. DMEA will contact offerors previous customers to verify how successful the offeror's firm was in servicing the identified fire protection systems under those contracts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of experience with comparable projects will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Unsatisfactory performance on previous contracts will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span> Quotes will be evaluated to ensure that all labor rates proposed are consistent with industry practices and historical prices paid by the Government for similar services. The Government will verify that the number of hours proposed for completing preventative maintenance work is consistent with industry practices and the Government's experience on similar work.</p>
<p><strong>Representations and Certifications: </strong>To be eligible for contract award, vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM): <a href="http://www.SAM.gov">www.SAM.gov</a>. If not registered at this time, vendors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quote. If a prospective successful offeror cannot become registered by two (2) weeks after the date proposals are due, their quote will be considered non-responsive and award will be made to the next lowest-priced technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Because DMEA is a secure facility, DMEA staff will escort all maintenance workers around the facility and during performance. Upon completion, the COR will inspect all work to ensure all maintenance was performed, all necessary repairs were made, and that the system is functioning properly. When remedial emergency maintenance is required, DMEA will contact the contractor to schedule the repair work. If the Government determines that the cause of any needed repairs is the fault of the contractor, the repairs shall be made at no cost to the Government.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The work and associated deliverables to be performed under the contract include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Procurement, fabrication, field assembly, installation, testing and commissioning of three (replacement) 2000 KVA, 13.8 KV-480 volt spot network normal power dry type transformers, one (upgraded from 500KVA) 1500 KVA, 13.8 KV-480 emergency power dry type transformer, 480 volt switchgear, interconnecting 480 Volt bus ducts, incoming 15 KV cables from ACRF Vault 10, necessary cable terminations, three 15 KV Fused Load Break Disconnect Switches for normal power feeders 60, 70, 80 and one 15 KV Fused Load break Disconnect Switch for emergency power feeder 85L1(old W10). In addition to transformers and switchgear Vault 11 will be cooled by three (3) new 12-ton vertical floor mounted air conditioning units.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The 13,800 volt feeders #60, #70 &amp; #80 emanating from Vault 10 serve the three existing spot network transformers while Feeder #W10, also emanating from Vault 10, serves the existing 500 KVA emergency transformer. These existing feeders, bus-ways between each transformer, overhead conduit for the switchgear and the switchgear itself will be replaced by this project and are all below the line of the proposed new mezzanine platform that will house the new transformers.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The upgraded emergency power transformer will provide the future capability of adding additional equipment such as the Air Handling Units that supply air to the ambulatory clinics and research laboratories in the ACRF. Additionally the project requires the removal of life safety equipment power for the Clinical Research Center (CRC) to be re-fed from the CRC Vault AB. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This change will mitigate any interruption or disruption that might occur with shutdowns during construction in the vault that could impact the hospital (CRC).</span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">After installation of the structural work for the mezzanine platform which encompasses the entire footprint of Vault 11, the sequential removal of each transformer will be accomplished and new dry type transformers assembled, installed, and energized on the new mezzanine platform. Along with each transformer each new section of the electrical switchgear will be installed and connected to the new transformer and distribution feeders to allow uninterrupted power service to the building. Once complete, the old switchgear will be disconnected and removed.</span></p>

<DESC>Title: Hawaii Bikeshare Planning
The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted.  See below.
QUESTION1: Pursuant to Addendum 1 issued 12/09/2014, shifting the solicitation to full and open competition, are the FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures still applicable? ANSWER1: Yes. 
QUESTION2: Section II Contractor Qualifications states the resume submitted for key personnel shall not exceed one page. Is that one page overall for the entire team or one page for each staff member. ANSWER2: One page per staff member 
QUESTION3: The BikeShare System Recommendations RFP seems to be largely oriented around planning and community engagement, however there is a specific mention of ?final detailed drawings for station designs? (p. 12).  Are these intended to be specific station plans, or typical plans illustrating different potential installation options? ANSWER3: Typical plans illustrating different potential installation options
QUESTION4: The BikeShare System Recommendations Report entails support regarding vendor and operator contracting. Does EPA see any conflicts if a person participating in this EPA-funded bike share project decides to pursue the actual system implementation (vendor and operator contracting) in the future? ANSWER4: This EPA procurement is only for a planning purchase order. EPA will not be involved with the procurement of the actual system implementation, and hence does not see any conflict of interest. The entities involved with the system implementation will utilize their own processes and how they conduct any corresponding implementation procurements will be up to them.
QUESTION5: Will EPA entertain approaches to Task 1: Bikeshare Community Engagement that change the process requirements (as an example for illustrative purposes - fewer stakeholder meetings and more community workshops)? ANSWER5: To clarify, the purpose of identifying the number of meetings/workshops as outlined in the Statement of Work is to ensure adequate coverage and engagement of stakeholders and community members -- as with the Task overall. Please estimate your quote based on the numbers and approaches identified in the Statement of Work. 
QUESTION6: Does this contract require audited rates? ANSWER6: No
QUESTION7: Do rates need to be based on raw direct pay rate times overhead? ANSWER7: For the presentation of hourly rates in response to this RFQ, please only provide Fully Burdened Rates.
QUESTION8: Can profit be applied to rate inclusive of overhead? ANSWER8: For the presentation of hourly rates in response to this RFQ, please only provide Fully Burdened Rates.

<DESC>12/18/14:
<p>The purpose of this Amendment 0001 to Solicitation GS-03P-15-QK-C-0003 is to hereby incorporate the following changes:</p>
<p>1.  The due date for proposals is hereby changed to Tuesday, December 30, at 4:30 PM EST.  The submittal location remains at U.S. General Services Administration, Pittsburgh Field Office, Moorhead Federal Building, 1000 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1316, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.</p>
<p>2.  The C301-SAT Form is hereby incorporated into the solicitation/contract.</p>
<p>3.  The following questions and their corresponding answers are hereby incorporated into the solicitation/contract:</p>
<p>a.  Question:  They state that there is an attachment 1 included that is a previous survey for the building.  Can that be provided for us?<br /> <br />Answer:   This was stated in the scope of work in error.  There is no previous survey to attach.</p>
<p>b. Question: Can you provide us the age of the building?</p>
<p>Answer:  The building was constructed in 1995.  Given the age of the facility, we are operating under the assumption that no asbestos containing materials were used for its construction.<br /> <br />c. Question: There are three doors in question in the specifications.  The first door is a bullet proof door, but the specifications do not state if they should be wood or metal.  Please confirm.</p>
<p>Answer:  The door frame must be metal.  The door should meet the specifications contained in the scope of work.  If the door is wooden, the finish shall be Stain Grade.</p>
<p>d. Question: Do we need permits?</p>
<p>Answer: No permits are necessary for this project.</p>
<p>e. Question:  I have a few questions about the HVAC in the ADP Main Telephone Room.  Where is the condensing unit going to be placed?   Where outside in relations to the room in question, and distance away?</p>
<p>Answer: We did not specify a location for the condensing unit.  The condensing unit hsall be placed in an appropriate location to service the newly installed unit in accordance with local and national codes as well as manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>f. Question: After reading through the solicitation, in Section II.E of the C201-SAT-Tradeoffs, it describes that the offeror shall submit the Annual Representations and Certifications, using the attached Offeror Representation and Certifications (C301-SAT).  We did not receive any Representation and Certifications to fill out to submit with this proposal.  How can we acquire this document?</p>
<p>Answer: I apologize for this oversight.  I have included the C-301-SAT document as part of this amendment.  Please be sure your company is registered in SAM (www.sam.gov) as this is a requirement.</p>
<p><br />Please be sure to complete this modification form and return with your proposal package along with the C301-SAT form and all other items as requested with the original solicitation.</p>
<p>Please email shannon.scureman@gsa.gov with any questions you may have.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0002 for Solicitation GS-03P-15-QK-C-0003 hereby incorporates the following questions and their respective answers into the solicitation/contract:<br />
<p>1.  Question: While looking over the documents, I could not find where it explicitly stated about a bid bond. There was a brief and vague mention of a payment bond on the Notice to Offeror's, but I couldn't find a percentage of the bid amount, etc. I did find on the SF1442 that it said a payment and performance bond was not required nor was an offer guarantee.</p>
<p>Answer: A performance bond and a payment bond are both required for this project.  However, these are not necessary until an award has made.  Once we award this contract, the contractor who receives the award will be responsible for providing these bonds to us at that time, before the notice to proceed is issued.</p>
<p><br />2.  Question: Regarding the VCT and the Static Resistant VCT flooring requirement, we can not find any referenced square footage for any of the rooms referenced for new VCT flooring. With the exception of the computer room which was stated to be approximately 550sf, but can not find measurements for Storage, Fire, Break room or ADP Main telephone and computer room.</p>
<p>Answer: VCT is required in the 3 areas listed in the specifications (computer room, break room, and storage room).</p>
<p><br />3.  Question: On page 10 Under Finishes, the SOW talks about tile being installed in ADP rooms, then directly below, under HVAC, references the ADP room. There are no labels on the project drawings indicating an ADP room, so with the wording it's a bit unclear whether this is one room or multiple rooms in need of new VCT flooring.</p>
<p>Answer: Page 10 of 10 of the USAO master specs lists the computer room as the ADP room.  The computer room (ADP room) is the room on the drawing located between the spaces labeled conference room and office.  The space is currently open to the hallway.  A new wall and door shall be installed to close it off thus creating the computer room.  The space is approximately 120 sq. ft.  Static resistant VCT is required in the space.</p>
<p><br />4.  On page 3 of 10 on the specs it shows a Hirsch Access keypad/prox reader? What are the specs/model number for this product?</p>
<p>Answer: You are only to provide the Hirsch MB8 back box.  The card readers and door contacts are being provided by the security contractor and not the general contractor.</p>
<p><br />5.  Page 10 of 10 states, " VCT shall be installed in storage rooms, file rooms and break rooms. In addition, Static Resistant VCT shall be installed in telephone and computer (ADP) rooms.  Per conversation with Chris Pless, the end user is only interested in Static Resistant VCT only in the computer room. Request clarification.</p>
<p>Answer: The computer room (ADP) room does require static resistant VCT.  The customer also wants normal VCT in the break room.  VCT already exists in the storage room, and this must be replaced.  They want new VCT in the 3 areas specified in the SOW.</p>
<p><br />6.  Request floor plan measurements (prefer pdf file) of rooms on floor to be renovated with security enhanced infrastructure. Other recommended option, if amendable, is to schedule another site visit for the contractor to take measurements. As example, it is our understanding that the computer room floor plan is 120 sq. ft. Request confirmation.</p>
<p>Answer: Attached is a dimension drawing of the space.  The dimensions are APPROXIMATE and should be used only for reference purposes.</p>
<p><br />7.  Request clarification of "WF01A" on drawing on last page of SOW. There is no SOW verbiage on "WF01A" as there are for other walls (WT-04, WT-02, WT-01A).</p>
<p>Answer: There is no wall type WF01A; the F is actually a T.  It should read WT01A.</p>
<p><br />8.  Question: Request an extension to accommodate holidays and additional information.</p>
<p>Answer: We are unable to extend this solicitation any further than December 30, 2014.</p>
<p><br />The due date for proposals remains Tuesday, December 30, at 4:30 PM EST.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact shannon.scureman@gsa.gov.</p>

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for expanding its citrus processing and packing facilities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Project Background and Description of Grantee</span>:</p>
<p>Hama Holding Investment Company is comprised of seven subsidiaries focused on agriculture production, processing and marketing of fruits and vegetables.  Since 1996, Hama Holding Investment Company has considerable expanded its business to become the largest citrus producer and exporter in Egypt, producing 10% of Egyptian citrus exports.</p>
<p>Hama Holding Investment Company established Hama for Food Industries (Hama) as an export-oriented citrus fruit processor, while another subsidiary, El Gebaly Fruit Company, supports the growing domestic market demand.   Due to Hama Holding Investment Company's increased agricultural production, Hama seeks to enhance its postharvest processing capacity and capabilities.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Hama is implementing a three- phased expansion at their Salheya City facility, which is located in a private industrial free zone, approximately 60 miles outside of Cairo.  Over a five year period, the expansion is anticipated to implement additional processing lines, cold storage capacities and new juicing and corrugated carton operations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Description of Study Components</span>:</p>
<p>The feasibility study will provide recommendations on the implementation of high-capacity citrus sorting, grading and packing processing lines; cold storage technology and equipment; and juicing and corrugated carton operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $503,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Reclamation, through this Prospectus, is outlining opportunities for a new expanded concession operation at New Melones Lake. This Prospectus is for the development of a marina and other commercial services that provide facilities and services as have been determined by the New Melones Lake Area Resource Management Plan and related documents. The planning effort that culminated in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) in 2010 provides the basic guidance for a new concession operation at New Melones. Reclamation has completed an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impacts (EA/FONSI) for the issuance of this prospectus identifying concession area boundaries and recreation services that shall be required along with additional services that would be authorized. The EIS and ROD, EA/FONSI, plus numerous other helpful documents mentioned throughout this Prospectus, may be viewed by visiting a specially developed New Melones Prospectus website at http://www.usbr.gov/mp/ccao/newmelones<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Business opportunities for the next concession contract term may include a full service marina, limited overnight lodging, houseboat and pleasure boat rentals, retail sales, RV Park, and day use facilities. Some operations may be seasonal in nature while others will serve year-round business demands. There may also be other appropriate facilities and activities that Offerors will suggest as a part of their unique proposals. It is likely that successful Offerors will propose a development program that requires substantial new concession investment. (Please see PART 5 of the attached Prospectus for detailed information on the proposal evaluation process to be conducted by Reclamation).<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Concession operations at New Melones have been operating in a very similar manner for over 25 years. However, since the construction of the original marina, there have been weather related and wave action incidents which has led to the conclusion that major portions of the marina must be relocated to a more protected cove. The new contract will provide for a new marina location that is much more protected. The current water based operations shall be terminated with the new contract except for the water area for the mooring ball field, which shall be available as a seasonal operation. The land portion of the original marina area will be available as part of the new contract, along with new land areas in the expanded concession boundary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Land based operations may continue to be utilized in the existing marina concession boundary. The concession area water well and one (possibly two if the outgoing 1 concessionaire leaves the one they own) 55,000 gallon potable water storage tanks are available and located adjacent to the existing maintenance building.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A maintenance yard is fenced and utilized by the current concession contractor for storage of concession-related personal property including rental houseboats, pleasure boats, and personal watercraft during the off-season or when demand for them is low. Sufficient land space is available in the existing land based operations to permit the maintenance yard to be expanded for the provision of Dry Yard Storage for houseboats seasonally moored in the Mooring Ball Field.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Additional land based facilities include paved and unpaved roads, a paved marina access ramp, two paved parking lots with overhead lighting and one unpaved parking lot, and a full hook-up RV site for temporary occupancy by the concession manager and/or site security staff. Additional facilities may be available for temporary use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Boat and houseboat rentals, RV sites, attractively designed cabin/yurt installations, and quality day use opportunities are all services that, following the re-development, should show immediate visitor demand. Current occupancy levels on rental boat slips at the existing marina is already nearly 100% and increases and upgrades in those Fixed Assets will also be met with continued user popularity. In addition, an existing waiting list for marina slips indicates a high interest in having a boat moored at New Melones.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It is apparent that this opportunity at New Melones Lake will require some well managed and timed phasing for new development to realize all of the apparent benefits. Reclamation is prepared to work closely with the eventual new concession contractor in approving and helping to coordinate the re-development of commercial public facilities. This Prospectus will be open for a period of 60 days in recognition of the complexities involved and the potential for individual Offerors to develop proposals. There are also inherent complexities in this opportunity because of the relocation of the marina and development of new RV camping and lodging opportunities.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">With the change to a business model that is committed to the provision of new facilities and services, Reclamation foresees outstanding commercial opportunities at New Melones Lake. New Melones is readily accessible by millions of potential visitors. It is within 3 hours drive of the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento and other municipalities in central California. The location, environment, scenic vistas and a multitude of outdoor recreation opportunities at New Melones Lake and vicinity make this a desirable location for a marina and related water-based commercial recreation services. Together, this presents a financially viable business opportunity favorable for the establishment of appropriately designed recreation facilities and services with outstanding growth potential over the term of the next concession contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The current concession contractor does not have any preferential rights for consideration on the next contract term nor will the eventual new operator have preference for the contract term following this opportunity.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Reclamation will provide through this Prospectus, opportunities for prospective Offerors to tour existing facilities, ask appropriate questions and express concerns regarding aspects of this concession business opportunity (see PART 3 Section B of the attached Prospectus).<br /> <br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #363636;">**This announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer nor any solicitation of any offer or </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">commit the Government </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #363636;">to purchase, otherwise acquire, issue, subscribe for, or sell any services.**</span></p>

<CONTACT>Tim Evans, Senior Analyst, Email Tim.Evans.ctr@dha.mil - Mike Sharpe, Contract Analyst, Email Michael.Sharpe.ctr@dha.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA), formerly TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), seeks information about methods DHA may use to improve its health care claims processing compliance reviews to identify and report improper payments made by DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors to civilian healthcare providers and/or TRICARE beneficiaries. This process is conducted in compliance with TRICARE Regulation which charges TRICARE purchased care contractors with the responsibility of providing timely and accurate processing of all healthcare claims. The processing is also performed to meet requirements of Public Law 107-300 - Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, and amended in Public Law 111-204 as the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010, which stipulate in general that agencies are required to examine the risk of improper payments in all programs and activities by identifying and reporting improper payments to the Office of Budget and Management (OMB) for publication in the DOD Annual Financial Report (AFR), and to the DHA, Uniformed Services, and TRICARE Regional/Program Offices (TRO) to assess contract claims processing performance. <br /><br />To accomplish its goals, the DHA intends to expand the TCRS requirements to include supporting the DHA by validating results of DHA Improper Payment Program-initiated focused studies which result from contract claims processing compliance reviews; healthcare data analysis and/or mining; the implementation of a new health benefit; or at the request of other DHA entities. The ultimate goal is to develop contract requirements that achieve the maximum impact and value for our taxpayers. In particular, the DHA seeks comments regarding which approaches it should consider to assess various aspects of identifying improper payments and/or developing requirements for focused studies. The intent of the RFI is to gather information from industry about commercial best practices, benchmarks or other methods which DHA may use for upcoming contract requirements. The information will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research in determining DHA's acquisition strategy and contract requirements, and to achieve its overall objectives under the Program. Specific requirements and additional detailed information about the Program are below: <br /><br />BACKGROUND: TRICARE is a DOD healthcare program which serves active duty and retired military personnel, other uniformed service personnel, and their family members. DHA is accountable for the management and operation of the TRICARE health benefits program, which provides medical, dental and pharmacy care through the Military Health System (MHS) to over 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide in DOD Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and is augmented with private sector services obtained through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSCs), TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP), TRICARE Pharmacy (TPharm) Program and Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) contracts. <br />DHA currently has a contract in place to assist in validating that its contractors are performing healthcare reimbursement determinations and healthcare claims processing services in accordance with TRICARE directives and/or specific contract requirements. The DHA TCRS contract provides an independent, impartial review of the reimbursement determinations and healthcare claims processing services provided by the MCSCs, TDEFIC, TOP, TPharm and ADDP contractors. Compliance reviews utilized by the TCRS contractor to determine whether payment, or, as specified, coding and payment, was accomplished in accordance with TRICARE regulation or contract provisions, are not governed by Government Auditing Standards and are not conducted in accordance with the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards better known as the Yellow Book. <br /><br />The TCRS contractor performs claims processing compliance reviews on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis depending on the DHA purchased care contractor's contract requirements. Quarterly compliance reviews are conducted on the MCSCs, TDEFIC, and TOP contracts, while compliance reviews are conducted semi-annually on the TPharm and ADDP contracts. Separate annual health care cost (AHCC) reviews are performed on each MCSC. These reviews are performed to support the accuracy of Target Health Care Costs and to identify unallowable underwritten health care costs under the terms of the MCSCs. <br /><br />The TCRS contractor develops a process to validate the accuracy of claims payment based on claims processing documentation provided by the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors. DHA provides statistically valid samples of TRICARE purchased care data records in the form of a list of TRICARE Encounter Data (TED) Internal Control Numbers (ICNs) listings to both the TCRS and DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors to initiate the compliance review process. The DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors have approximately 45 calendar days from the date of receiving the TED ICN listing to compile claims processing documentation which substantiates the adjudication and reimbursement of the healthcare claim being reviewed. Documentation includes, but is not limited to, the following:<br />&bull; Legible copies of healthcare claim forms (i.e. CMS 1500, UB 04, DD2642, etc.);<br />&bull; Claim-related correspondence when attached to a claim or related to the adjudication action (i.e., status inquiries, written and/or telephone development records);<br />&bull; Other claim-related documentation such as medical reports, medical review records, coding sheets, referral and authorization forms (if applicable);<br />&bull; Referrals for civilian medical care (SF Forms 513 or 2161);<br />&bull; Other health insurance and third party liability documents; <br />&bull; Screen shots of the TRICARE purchased care contractor's claims processing system;<br />&bull; Discounted rate agreements, negotiated rate(s), per diem rate(s), state prevailing fee (s) or fee schedule(s);<br />&bull; Pricing information (i.e. Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) perspective payment system (PPS);<br />&bull; Copy of Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for selected claim; and <br />&bull; Other such documents to support the actions taken on the claim. <br />Based on provided documentation, the TCRS contractor re-adjudicates the claim in accordance with TRICARE regulations and reimbursement requirements to detect errors in claims payment and or TED payment record coding. Errors are detected by comparing the payment and coding actions as indicated on the TED Audit Detail Record (TADR) provided by the DHA, to the documentation provided by the TRICARE purchased care contractor. The TADR is the primary tool used during the compliance review, and is facsimile of the TED payment record as reported by the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors. The TADR contains claims processing, patient and or sponsor, healthcare provider, admission and or discharge, procedure and diagnostic code and healthcare utilization information. Each TED data field reported on the TADR is found in Chapter 2 of the TRICARE Systems Manual. The TCRS contractor uses the TADR to record the rationale used to either assess payment or coding errors, or to approve the adjudication process of the claim being reviewed. <br /><br />TRICARE purchased care contractors are given two rebuttal opportunities to provide additional supporting documentation or provide substantive information supporting the adjudication actions. The TCRS contractor and DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors have specified timelines to complete each phase and aspect (i.e., initial, rebuttal, and 2nd rebuttal) of the compliance review process. For this reason, compliance reviews can take between 6 and 8 months to finalize. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures that all TRICARE regulation, letters of instructions, or DHA TRICARE purchased care contract modification requirements in effect at the time the claim was processed into the DHA TRICARE purchased care contractors' system, are met. TRICARE manuals are available at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/. <br />The TCRS contractor manages the receipt and storage of all claims documentation to enable the quick retrieval of claims documentation throughout the entire compliance review cycle. The TCRS contractor securely stores and protects the claims processing documentation containing Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) until such time as the DHA instructs the TCRS contractor to destroy documentation for claims with no assessed payments or TED record coding errors. <br />The TCRS contractor maintains up-to-date hardware and/or software which enables auditors to group and price inpatient hospital claims processed under the TRICARE DRGs reimbursement methodology; to accurately adjudicate claims subject to reimbursement under the SNF perspective payment system (PPS); to accurately group and price outpatient hospital claims processed under the TRICARE Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS); verify the accurate coding of claims using claims auditing software (ClaimCheck or equivalent); access the TRICARE web-based Provider Reimbursement Rates and Restrictions to verify the appropriate reimbursement rates (i.e., Ambulatory Surgery, Anesthesia, CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC), DRG, Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS), Mental Health and OPPS), or any TRICARE reimbursement restrictions applicable to the claim under review. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures staff has the appropriate DHA security clearance allowing the access and utilization of Government-controlled databases (i.e. General Inquiry DEERS (GIQD) web-based application to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) and DEERS Catastrophic Cap and Deductible, PEPR Care Detailed Information System (PCDIS) and TED Audit (TA) Application) to verify the eligibility of patients; to verify the accurate reporting of provider information and correct reimbursement of hospital claims eligible for reimbursement under the DRG reimbursement methodology, and to document DHA purchased care contractors' payment or coding errors. <br />The TCRS contractor ensures that experienced Medical Review Staff at the Registered Nurse (RN) or Physician Assistant (PA) levels are available as needed to review claims involving questionable TRICARE purchased care claims decisions on appropriateness of care issues. The TCRS contractor also ensures that translation services are available to accurately review claims submitted by the TOP contractor for overseas claims.<br />The TCRS contractor reviews and analyzes special claims processing, benefit issues, contractor compliance with new payment methodologies or recent benefit changes, and brings issues identified to the attention of the DHA. To ensure that compliance reviews are being conducted in accordance with DHS TRICARE regulations and TRICARE purchased care contract requirements, the TCRS contractor conducts internal quality assurance audits to identify incorrect error determinations and omission by auditors; inconsistencies amount auditors; and any problems with audit procedures, guidelines, or operational and policy directive that adversely affect the accuracy and consistency of the compliance reviews. <br />RFI RESPONSE FORMAT: <br />DHA requests RFI responses in the form of a white paper in Microsoft Word (Times New Roman, 12-point font). Please submit responses in the following format: <br />Section I. Company name, mailing address; and the name, phone number, fax number, and email of the designated point of contact.<br />Section II. The name and contact information for the business or other organization whose views are represented in the paper if that contact information is different from that provided in Section I.<br />Section III (NO MORE THAN 15 PAGES). Please provide responses to each of the questions listed below. <br /><br />QUESTIONS: <br />Respondents should review the Background information above prior to answering the questions. Respondents are asked to draw their responses from objective, empirical, and actionable evidence and to cite this evidence within their responses. DHA is particularly interested in the findings of research in the areas of medical, pharmacy and dental claims auditing, coordination of benefits in relation to other health insurance and hospital or physician balance billing, patient eligibility and other health insurance coverage, requirements for professional credentialing needed to effectively perform compliance reviews, methods for analyzing and evaluating healthcare data or what the most effective sampling approach that can be used to identify improper payments. While some of the goals of the improper payment oversight program are directed by statute, the overall goal of the program is to ensure that the DHA is accurately and effectively identifying potential or actual improper payments. DHA may use responses in designing the future direction of the DHA Improper Payment Program.<br />DHA asks that each respondent address each of the following questions as it pertains to utilizing a single contractor to provide technical, analytical, and professional healthcare support to meet all claims processing compliance reviews performed on all DHA TRICARE purchased care contracts:<br />1. Given the Background information provided above, what do you believe is the best approach to evaluate contractor compliance with TRICARE regulations and contract requirements and payment accuracy that would deliver maximum program value to the tax payer? In particular, the DHA seeks comments regarding approaches it should consider to assess various aspects of identifying improper payments and/or developing requirements for focused studies. <br />2. What advantages would the program expect to realize by adopting the approach you described in your response to Question 1? <br />3. How would utilization of the approach in your response to Question 1 allow the DHA to develop a robust compliance review process ensuring an improved process for identifying and reporting improper payments?<br />4. What are some important factors for DHA to consider if it were to adopt your recommended approach (including any alternative approaches you suggest in your response) in organizing its improper payment oversight program in this way?

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought is tied to potential future requirements outside the Period of Performance and Scope of any existing contracts at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). Any potential requirements for work as briefed in this Sources Sought will not commence prior to June 2015. USAFA requests information from potential contractors that believe they have the capabilities necessary to perform engineering related tasks and research activities in support of the Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE).<br /><br />CAStLE is a research center in the Department of Engineering Mechanics at the USAFA. The efforts performed by CAStLE cover a variety of tasks that follow aircraft and other structures through their life cycle from cradle to grave. CAStLE efforts cover a wide range of structure-related activities, spanning: <br /><br />1. Basic development and characterization of materials, <br />2. Mechanical testing, <br />3. Material corrosion susceptibility and mitigation, <br />4. Computer modeling and finite element analysis, <br />5. Flight data acquisition, <br />6. Structural teardown analysis, <br />7. Analysis of damaged, failed and/ or aged structure/ materials, and <br />8. Integration with the USAFA cadet/ faculty curricular mission.</p>
<p>The type of activities that may be sought are sustainment engineering (review, assess, define, resolve technical deficiencies revealed in products and materials), structures teardown analysis, root-cause/ failure analysis, non-destructive analysis, design analysis, system design improvement, developmental testing, component testing, full-scale testing, certification and force management development, force management execution, risk analysis, course development and training, subject matter expert support to USAFA cadets and faculty, maintenance/ operation/ upgrade of USAFA CAStLE laboratory facility, and preparation/delivery of written materials such as reports and/ or briefings. These types of activities may be required for a variety of structures and materials such as those found in aircraft, ships, ground vehicles, support equipment, bridges, and other categories of aging systems.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates any of the following NAICS codes may be applicable to this effort: <br />1. 541712 <em>Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology),<br /></em>2. 336411 <em>Aircraft rebuilding/ conversions/ overhauling/ developing and producing prototypes for aircrafts, <br /></em>3. 336413 <em>Aircraft assemblies,<br /></em>4. 488190 <em>Aircraft testing services</em>.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking all small businesses, to include Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, SBA 8(a) Disadvantaged Small Businesses or any other small business that have the capability and qualifications to provide approximately 110,000 infective larvae and adult worms of the filarial parasite Brugia Malayi per year. The contractor will be required to furnish all the necessary services, personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government. The contractor shall furnish the specific strain and quantities of these parasitic worms according to the required procedures. The primary objective for the use of these parasites is for studying human immunity to Filariasis, a disease which causes elephantiasis in human, and to develop an appropriate vaccine for the infection. In addition to the above, the colonies of the mosquito Aedes Aegypti (Liverpool strain) are required to be maintained for the production of the infective larvae. The parasitic materials derived from the mosquitoes must be collected, counted, stored, maintained and further processed in a manner required for this research study. The larvae and adult worms which are required to be produced from the larvae, have to be stored until need in a freezer (-80 degree centigrade), and injected intraperitoneally into jirds or suspended in media 199 and shipped immediately by air express. The NIAID anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price type contract; the NAICS code is 541990, size standard is $15M. Any potential offeror should respond with a capability statement by January 7, 2015. Capability statements must reference similar work that has been performed by the offeror and the dollar value of that work. Respondents must demonstrate, within the capability statements, skills and abilities that reflect experience with medical services. Potential offerors must indicate business size in their capability statement. This is a market survey, not a request for proposals. All questions must be directed, in writing, to Carolyn Wilder at cwilder@niaid.nih.gov.

Industry is encouraged to review the Draft Documents and submit questions and comments to the Government for further consideration.  The Government is not responsible for any costs associated with: reviewing the Draft Documents, preparing and submitting comments, or participating in Industry Day.  Furthermore, the Government is not obligated to compensate respondents for any information received, even if the Draft Documents are revised as a result of a respondent's comment or question. Respondents should refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this Notice because any information received by the Government will not be treated as proprietary information.  Lastly, while the Government is seeking comments and questions concerning the draft technical plans and specifications, at this time the Government does not intend to publish such questions and comments and does not intend to publish the Government's responses or comments thereto.    <br>        <br>    This notice is not a solicitation, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation.  This not a request for proposals and the Government will not accept unsolicited proposals for this project.    <br>        <br>    General Project Description: The USACE requirement is a roller compacted concrete reinforcing berm (RCC Berm) downstream of the Center Hill Auxiliary Dam. The purpose is dam safety. The work consists of controlled blasting and excavation of foundation rock, consolidation grouting, and construction of the RCC Berm. The Berm foundation excavation is estimated at 50,000 CY and approximate maximum depth of excavation is 40 feet. Dental concrete and a concrete leveling pad will be accomplished prior to RCC construction. The RCC Berm is approximately 100 feet high and 1,000 feet long and contains about 130,000 CY of roller-compacted concrete.     <br>        <br>    The scope of work also contains drilling, blasting, scaling and stabilization of rock slopes in the Left Rim just west of the main dam embankment. The work may also include stabilization of rock with rock bolts to reshape each side to a stable 1.5:1 slope. Rock bolts would be used where blasting methods are inadequate to stabilize individual large blocks of rock. Blasting methods may include presplit, production blasting, blast scaling and carefully controlled vibration criteria. Total excavated material is approximately 250,000 CY.     <br>        <br>    This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change.     <br>        <br>    Disclosure of the Magnitude of the Construction Project: The disclosure of magnitude range is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.    <br>        <br>    Industry Day and Site Visit: An Industry Day event and site visit will be held on December 16, 2014 at 10:00 am CST at the Center Hill Resource Manager's Shop Conference Room.

<AWARDEE>Aerojet Rocketdyne HWY 50  & Aerojet Rd Rancho Cordova, CA 95670-6000
<DESC>BACKGROUND One of the major challenges to achieving effective and affordable hypersonic flight is the ability to have a single engine start at zero velocity and accelerate to Mach 6+. To date the combined cycle engine approach, where one engine known as a gas turbine accelerates to a velocity that enables another engine known as a scramjet to take-over and accelerate the rest of the way has been investigated. This would be an acceptable solution except that the take-over velocity for the scramjet has been too high to be able to use an Off-the-Shelf (OTS) turbine as the first engine. Therefore getting to hypersonic speeds has been held back because of the need for two costly engine developments with uncertain outcomes on the success of both engine developments. <p> Aerojet Rocketdyne (AR) has developed technology which has shown through testing, under Independent Research and Development (IRAD) funding (using the direct connect combustor internal mold lines from DARPAs Falcon Combined Cycle Engine Test, FaCET, program), that it may very well be possible to have a dual mode ramjet propulsion system that allows the take-over velocity to be reduced to Mach 2 or lower and transitions to the scramjet engine permitting the vehicle to accelerate to cruise operating conditions.  This take-over velocity would allow an OTS available turbine engine to be used, greatly reducing cost and risk and decreasing the development time by at least 10 years. The purpose of this task is to use the scramjet technology developed by AR and explore and characterize ignition, operability and performance at simulated conditions representing Combined Cycle and Ramjet modes of operation over the mode transition corridor. <p> SCOPE OF WORK <p> The overall objective of the proposed Turbine-Based Combined-Cycle (TBCC) Low Mach Risk Reduction Direct Connect Combustor (DCC) Testing is to advance key enabling technology for TBCC hypersonic propulsion systems by extending low Mach and altitude operation of ARs 3rd generation powerhead for the dual-mode scramjet propulsion system while maintaining maximum flight Mach capability.  The specific objectives are to explore and characterize ignition, operability and performance at simulated conditions representing Combined Cycle and Ramjet modes of operation over the mode transition corridor. AR will conduct a hydrocarbon fueled direct connect test that provides a flexible, low cost approach which will reduce risk for TBCC hypersonic propulsion systems.  The contractor shall perform the following Tasks: (1) task planning and status, (2) integrated and coordinated pre-test analyses, (3) hardware refurbishment and fabrication, (4) ground tests in a jet burner test stand, and (5) post-test data analysis and reporting to meet program objectives.

<AWARDEE>BLUE TECH INC.;2251 SAN DIEGO AVE STE B155;SAN DIEGO;CA;92110
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      		
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for the procurement of two RadiantOne Virtual Directory Server (VDS) Context Edition - Non-Production Test/Development licenses and Radiant Logic RadiantOne Premium Annual Maintenance and Support.  This requirement is in support of the Department of VA Office of Information and Technology and Product Development.  This proposed action will be a Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Order  issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurements (SEWP) IV Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).  The period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 with three 12-month option periods. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for the purchase of two RadiantOne VDS Context Edition - Non-Production Test/Development licenses and Radiant Logic RadiantOne Premium Annual Maintenance and Support.  The Radiant Logic RadiantOne VDS licenses operate on a federated identity platform which enables authentication and specific authorization for identity management and context-driven applications.  The VDS licenses are designed specifically to solve data integration challenges for non-disruptive deployments in high volume, high complexity identity environments, without customization.  The Radiant Logic RadiantOne Premium Annual Maintenance and Support includes initial access to product upgrades, productivity enhancements, versions, releases, workarounds, bug fixes, and security/functional patches to licensed product(s).  The support shall be available via e-mail, web, phone and data knowledge base to support maintenance and troubleshooting.  
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Radiant Logic or authorized resellers can meet VA's requirements.  In April 2013, VA procured three (3) production and two (2) Non-Production software licenses with associated maintenance and support.  The Radiant Logic RadiantOne VDS software provides identity aggregation lightweight, proxy-based integration, subsystem integration for homogeneous identity sources and complete integration for a fully integrated, merged system.  Furthermore, Specialized Access Control Service (SAC) has been established to standardize and centralize the control of end-user access to VA Systems, data, and other resources.  SAC is "fine grained access control" that is tightly integrated with the "coarse grained access control" provided by the Provisioning Service.  Both the Provisioning and SAC services have been developed, tested, and deployed using the Radiant Logic RadiantOne VDS brand name software licenses.  
Two additional Non-Production software licenses are required so that the pre-production environment will maintain compatibility with the multi master replication high availability model in production.  The pre-production environment must match the production environment to ensure the solution is properly tested prior to deployment.  The purchase of a different brand, such as the Oracle Virtual Directory or IBM Integrator, would not allow for interoperability among existing systems due to the proprietary nature of each product and would not allow Identity and Access Management (IAM) to meet the objective of testing solutions in pre-production prior to deployment.  Furthermore, this lack of proper testing will lead to serious disruptions in the ability of a large user population to efficiently streamline and automate the granting and removing of electronic permissions to VA data, services, technology systems, and resources, as well as to enforce both coarse and fine grain control policies.  Specifically, the negative impacts of this degradation in service include a reduction or suspension of the support services that will be experienced by the current and planned customers of the Provisioning and SAC customers which include Veterans, beneficiaries, employees, contractor affiliates, and internal VA users.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  It was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name effort. In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b) (2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page and the justification will be made publicly available.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), the justification will be posted with the request for solicitation on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are authorized resellers of the requested software licenses and maintenance on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.

8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research to ascertain the ability of any other source, other than a Radiant Logic reseller, that can provide the aforementioned services.  VA technical experts conducted market research in November 2014 by researching other similar brand name items.  Specifically the Government reviewed software support from Oracle Virtual Directory Service product and the IBM Directory Integrator product.  The IAM team determined that the products in this space remain proprietary, and as such, solutions must be developed according to the specifications outlined by the product to be utilized, as opposed to a universal standard whereby any product can by utilized with a solution developed to that standard.  Simply said, solutions developed with one product cannot be utilized with a different product, without customizing the solution for utilization with the target product.

Additional market research was conducted by utilizing the Product Verification tool on the NASA SEWP website.  The search identified six authorized Radiant Logic resellers; one Value Added Reseller (VAR) and Computer System Original Equipment Manufacturer from Group A, one Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business VAR from Group B, three small business VARs from Group C, and one large business VAR from Group D.

<DESC>Synopsis :
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office 22 has established a purchase order (PO) with Tony Demaria Electric for installation of Automatic Transfer Switches for VA Long Beach Healthcare System. The PO was issued to ensure continuity of care to our Veterans and to avoid the possibility of a service stoppage which could have proved injurious to Veterans.
In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 and 41 USC 253(c)(2), a PO was issued for three months from date of award.

This notice is not a request for proposals or information. Please direct any questions to Ryoko Foran at Ryoko.foran@va.gov.

1.	Contracting Activity:
	Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 22, 4811 Airport Plaza Drive, Suite 600, Long Beach, CA 90815

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
	In accordance with the VHA Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Other Than Full and Open Competition Procurements, the VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHS) requests approval for firm-fixed price purchase order to Tony Demaria Electric, located at 131 West F Street, Wilmington, CA 90744.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
	VALBHS needs three (3) Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) installed for Building 126OP. The ATS allows the power coming from the life safety generators to enter the main switch gear and exit into the VA Medical Center. The current ATS are old and failing thus causing costly repairs and hospital power down time.  The current ATS can cause a life threatening situation to the Electronics Shop employees. The employees that manually transfer the 12,000 volts have to stand in front of the blast doors to switch the power, and if the switch fails, it could blow up and cause loss of life and or serious injury to the employee. One of the switches has already failed causing a long period of power loss to the VALBHS. A long period of power loss could cause loss of life to a veteran during an operation procedure or a resuscitator that requires power to constantly ventilate a patient could fail. Expected action must occur for the protection of patients and employee as soon as possible.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 
FAR 6.302-2 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2): Unusual and Compelling Urgency

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
The contract is needed immediately as it will impact patient care and treatment.  Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.  It was found that the ATS, which allows adequate power to enter into the VALBHS needs to be replaced or rebuilt. The switches protect the amplifier`s circuit and support the main substation. Failure to replace the ATS gear will result in a catastrophic power failure to the entire building, causing severe damage to hospital grade equipment and could lead to extreme voltage issues that could possibly escalate. This would pose an extreme risk to patients, possibly loss of life, and risk to employees which directly affect patient care.  It is critical that the ATS gear be replaced or rebuilt immediately to avoid any disastrous outcomes. Tony Demaria Electric is the only known company in the area that is familiar with the site conditions to complete the replacement of ATS for VALBHS. Based on previous experience with this company at VALBHS, they have the knowledge required to get the job done in a timely manner which has a minimal effect towards patient care. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:
	Synopsis of this procurement action was not submitted to FedBizOpps due to the urgent 	need for these services, in accordance with FAR 5. 202(a)(2). The contracting office will provide the availability of the justification, in accordance with FAR 6.305(b).
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:
	Searches in eCMS and FPDS yield results for a purchase order VA262-14-P-4238 awarded to Tony Demaria Electric for emergency replacement of ATS for VALBHS in the amount of $XXXXXX. The ATS replacement on that purchase order was for two (2) ATS.  
	Based on comparison with pervious purchase order VA262-14-P-4238, the estimated cost of $XXXXX is determined to be fair and reasonable.
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
	Due to the urgency of this requirement, minimal market research was conducted.  The market research conducted was for the purposes of determining fair and reasonable pricing. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	There are no other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
	No sources expressed an interest as stated in Section 6 above.
 
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
	If similar services are required of a non-emergent nature in the future, the Contracting Officer will survey the market for other vendors interested in completing the services by reviewing GSA, FBO and other sources on the internet.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
       		Office of Acquisition Operations
       	         	 	Strategic Acquisition Center - Frederick
                      	321 Ballenger Creek Drive, Suite 125
                     		Frederick, MD 21703


2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:

This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Strategic Acquisition Center - Frederick, Frederick, MD for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Veteran Directed Home and Community Based Service (VD-HCBS) Program. This activity proposes to negotiate a non-competitive award (sole source) with the Trustees of Boston College for the procurement of technical assistance, training, and financial readiness review support.  Under this procurement, the contractor will provide support services and training to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), and Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) staff to establish Veteran-Directed Home and Community Based Services (VD-HCBS) Programs.

The Trustees of Boston College's National Resource Center for Participant-Directed Services (NRCPDS) has been identified as the sole supplier that can provide all services sought under this requirement. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated to be awarded to the NRCPDS for a six month period of performance.

3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:

The VD-HCBS Program is a major Veterans Health Administration (VHA) home care initiative in collaboration with the Administration for Community Living.  The VD-HCBS Program provides an opportunity for the aging and disability network and VAMCs to modernize their approaches to service delivery in order to keep individuals at high risk of nursing home placement in their homes, with an array of home and community based services. Under the VD-HCBS Program, the veteran and veteran's family caregiver are able to; 

a.	Manage a flexible budget; 
b.	Decide for themselves what mix of services will best meet their personal care needs; 
c.	Hire their own personal care aides, including family or neighbors; and 
d.	Purchase items or services to live independently in the community. 

Veterans in this program receive an individualized needs assessment, support in developing their personalized care plan, and assistance in paying workers in accordance with local, state and federal laws from a trained case manager and fiscal management services provider.

In order to implement the VD-HCBS Program, the Contractor shall:  

a.	Train VACO, VAMC, Region and VISN staff on the concepts and principles of sustainable participant veteran directed services;
b.	Provide program and financial readiness reviews of aging and disability agencies and
c.	Provide VACO, VAMC, Region and VISN staff who are planning to, or currently contracting with VD-HCBS vendors with "as needed" technical assistance.

"	Concepts in participant-direction; 
"	Principles for purchasing Veteran-directed services;
"	Research findings of the participant directed model;  
"	Business management of a participant-directed mode;
"	Billing and budget reconciliations; and
"	General question response.

The estimated cost for this procurement is $265,100.00.   

4.	 STATUTORY AUTHORITY :

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." 

5.	RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), the cited authority is required when there is only one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency's need and provide the required services.  

NRCPDS is recognized as a national leader in the area of home and community based services.  The NRCPDS has developed handbooks on program operations and financial management in order to better assist state programs.

NRCPDS staff are leaders in the field of consumer directed care since its inception in 1999. NRCPDS actively partners with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pilot program, and the cash and counseling grant program.  

NRCPDS has been identified as the sole supplier that can provide all services sought under this requirement.  This organization has been performing services needed for this contract since 2010 with good performance.  The period of performance for the current contract will end on December 31, 2014.  

The Program Office is currently working with SAC-F acquisitions team to compete for a follow-on effort requiring services outlined in the PWS.  It is expected the new contract will be in place by July 1, 2015, but this would result in a lapse of performance.  This action is needed to prevent a lapse in service that is critical for the VA to ensure continued home health care support to aging and disabled Veterans.

6.	EFFORTS TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:

No market survey was conducted since these services are follow-on requirements to existing services.  Market research was conducted at the time of the original award.  

7.	 FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE/COST DETERMINATION:

The anticipated cost to the Government will be deemed fair and reasonable through application of appropriate price analysis techniques and procedures IAW FAR 15.404-1(b)(2).

8.	DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH:

As outlined above in 6, Efforts to Obtain Competition, this is a follow-on action and therefore no market research was conducted.  Market research will be conducted for the new contract to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.

9.	OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, where a delay in award of the contract would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement.

10.	A LISTING OF SOURCES IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:

See  6 above.

11.	 ACTIONS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:

This requirement will be competed by VHA to the fullest extent possible, given documented market research.

12.	TECHNICAL AND REQUIREMENTS CERIFICATIONS

I certify that the foregoing justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief


13.	 PROCURING CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:

I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  As this contract action does not exceed $650,000, the certification below required by FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) serves as approval.

The proposed action is for a contract extension for contract VA101(049A3)-P-0413 with McKesson Technologies Inc. (MTI), 5995 Windward Parkway Alpharetta, GA, 30005-4184 a large business concern.  The contract extension is for of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enterprise-wide licensing for unlimited use, updates, and clinical and technical support for evidence-based Utilization Management (UM) criteria and associated tools that interface seamlessly into the VHA's Quality Management System NUMI. The existing contract is set to expire on December 31, 2014. The period of performance will include a 2-month extension to services and has a total anticipated two month value of $196,975.33.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services

This extension is for the continued services for the nationally recognized enterprise-wide licenses to utilize both the electronic format and hard copies of evidenced-based clinical criteria for use with VHA's Quality Management System, NUMI.  The government-owned, NUMI application standardizes clinical appropriateness review of patient care at over 150 VHA facilities by integrating evidence-based clinical criteria into the application to assist clinicians and managers in care management decisions.The criteria is used in the process of reviewing care prospectively, concurrently and retrospectively to determine the appropriateness, medical necessity and efficiency of clinical care services across the health care continuum.  

The Agency requires a UM product that is nationally recognized, evidence-based, and accepted for use with the nationwide healthcare systems similar in size to VHA.  VHA requires a product that specifically can operate with NUMI application's middle tier business logic layer, criteria user interface, primary data entry screen, and all embedded reports.  In addition, the UM product must be able to integrate with NUMI warehousing databases, cubes (multidimensional databases that allow complex business intelligence analysis), and all reports that are currently used to inform real-time business processes as well as long-term strategic planning.  

Clinical review criteria is essential to the UM review process.  Standardization, across the VA, of clinical review has been achieved through the integration of the clinical criteria product into NUMI.  Without the web-based licensed clinical content in NUMI, the VHA would be limited in its ability to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of VHA delivered healthcare.  NUMI generated reports provide real-time data used by facilities to make decisions and plan improvements that increase access and quality of healthcare for Veterans. 

The new requirement is currently in the procurement process, however there is not sufficient time to award the new contract. Therefore, a two month extension is required in order to prevent a lapse in services. 

4.	Statutory Authority:

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304 (a) (2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2(a) (2) Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:

McKesson is the only UM evidence based criteria product  that meets all the Agency's needs.  McKesson is compatible with NUMI as it is able to operate with NUMI's middle tier business logic layer and integrate with the NUMI warehouseing databases which are essential to ensure a comprehensive Quality Management system.  Although there are other UM evidenced based products, none can seamlessly interface with the VHA NUMI system because of the technical constraints of the NUMI system. The other UM evidence based criteria products that are available would necessitate that VHA redesign NUMI to accept their third party product.   Such a redesign would require a shutdown of NUMI which cannot be happen as it would negatively impact the healthcare of Veterans. Without the full integration of the UM evidenced based criteria product into NUMI, hospitals would have to rely on hard copies or static versions of the criteria that will result in a loss of standardization and automation of the UM review process, a negative impact on the decisions for appropriate patient care will result, and ultimately, the access to inpatient care.  

The McKesson InterQual Criteria, Care Enhance Review Manager Enterprise (also call Review Manager), and the InterRater Reliability (IRR) Suite are all nationally recognized, clinically rich, evidence-based, and updated at least annually as well as seamlessly interfacing with NUMI, which meets the needs of the VHA.

The contract is currently in the fourth option year and set to expire on December 31, 2014. There is an urgent need to continue the current services for an additional two months in order to allow time for the new requirement. If the current services were to lapse the VA would be without the web-based licensed clinical content in NUMI, the VHA would be limited in its ability to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of VHA delivered healthcare.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  

Market research was conducted as described in Section 8 of this document.  Additional sources of UM Criteria were identified; however, none of the other UM Criteria products can seamlessly interface with NUMI.  The proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) in accordance with FAR 5.2.  Any proposals received will be evaluated against the requirements.

7.	Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: 

The contracting officer has already determined the price as fair and reasonable based on the current contract pricing listed in contract VA101(049A3)-P-0413. The current pricing for option year four will be used for the extension period.

8.	Market Research: 

Market research included internet searches to identify all clinical appropriate criteria available in the marketplace.  Although several products exist, only two meet VHA's need for a nationally recognized, evidence-based criteria, which is accepted for use with nationwide healthcare systems similar in size to the VHA.  The first product is InterQual, which is owned by McKesson Technology, Inc.  Second, the MCG product, formerly known as the Milliman Care Guidelines, is owned by Hearst Health Network.  VHA contacted Hearst Health Netowrk to inquire as to the ability of its product to work with NUMI. According to the point of contact at Hearst Health Network, the MCG product cannot seamlessly integrate with NUMI without additional NUMI development.  

A Sources Sought Notice was also published on FedBizOps on June 18, 2014 with responses due on June 25, 2014.  Four responses were received:  (1) McKesson Technologies Inc. , (2) Hearst Health Network, (3) The Oak Group, and (4) Maximus Federal. As noted when conducting the internet market research, both McKesson and Hearst Health Network offer products that are nationally recognized and accepted for use by large healthcare systems, but only McKesson seamlessly interfaces with VHA's proprietary NUMI system.  As to the other two sources,  Maximus offered the Hearst MCG product which is not compatible  with NUMI.  The Oak Group is not a nationally recognized product.  Furthermore,   VHA   contacted a representative of The Oak Group by telephone to inquire as to its ability to work with NUMI and according to a company spokesperson the Oak Group product could not be used without alterations to the NUMI application. Consequently, only InterQual products, which are proprietary to McKesson Technology, are compatible with NUMI.   McKesson can grant the right for VA to utilize their licensed clinical content and therefore is the only viable option at this time.  

9.	Other Facts: N/A
