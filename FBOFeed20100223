<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center's (ASC) KC-X Program Office, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is releasing a Presolicitation Notice for the KC-X Tanker Modernization Program. The KC-X Program Office plans to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the KC-X Program not earlier than 23 Feb 2010. This acquisition will be a full and open, best value competition conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, contracting by Negotiation, as supplemented.<br /><br />
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is not to be construed as a formal solicitation (Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP)). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. The Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation or communication submitted in response to this notice. Any submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Questions or comments to this notice should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This action will result in a fixed-price type contract for EMD of the KC-X system including four (4) developmental aircraft with options for up to 175 production aerial refueling tanker aircraft based on existing commercial aircraft designs; a production rate targeted at 15 aircraft per year is anticipated. Additional options include five years of interim contractor support (in support of the long term goal of standing up a completely organic Government repair capability), spare engines, warranties, wing refueling pod kits and studies. The contractor will ensure the aircraft acquired, including integrated military systems, are certified as flight worthy by the FAA (or foreign equivalent) during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the program.</p>
<p>The primary KC-X mission is to provide aerial refueling support to joint and allied forces engaged in homeland defense, global air-bridge deployments, and theater conflicts. The <br />KC-X will also augment existing transport aircraft by providing an enduring cargo capability for materiel, passenger, and medical/humanitarian aid transportation. Key performance capabilities to be provided by the KC-X include: (1) aerial refueling of all current and programmed fixed-wing receiver aircraft including same sortie boom and drogue capability; (2) fuel offload capability at least as good as the KC-135R; (3) the ability to operate anywhere, anytime with global communication, navigation, and air traffic management; (4) airlift capability to carry palletized cargo, passengers, and/or medical patients on the entire main cargo deck; (5) tanker receiver air refueling capability to enhance KC-X fleet effectiveness; (6) operations in chemical and biological environments;<br />(7) network centric information exchange with joint services; (8) survivability features allowing operations closer to the fight including detection and defeat of infrared missiles, situational awareness information, night vision operations, and electro-magnetic pulse protection; and (9) simultaneous multi-point drogue refueling capability.</p>
<p>Proposals will be due not earlier than&nbsp;75 days from the date of RFP release. Exchanges during the source selection process may include clarifications, communications, and discussions as necessary. Contract award is estimated for 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year 2010. The Air Force anticipates a single award but reserves the right to award multiple contracts or, not to award a contract at all.</p>
<p>This competition shall exclude award to a foreign prime contractor based on the required access to restricted information during contract performance.</p>

RTI DDS iscurrently supported on multiple platforms being used in the KSC Launch Control System(LCS) development effort such as RedHat Linux and Sun Solaris for Sparc. A market surveywas performed looking at the salient features of DDS implementation. The survey concludedthat the RTI DDS product is the only product that can satisfy all of the requirements ofthe KSC NE-C LCS development effort as it provides a data centric model for managingcomplexity in the system infrastructure. The additional capabilities associated withmessage topic queries, as well as the fault tolerance aspect, significantly reduce therisk of developing similar capabilities at KSC resulting in a reduction in the man hoursrequired to develop the Launch Control System. In addition, this RTI DDS product allowsfor a change in COTs products if needed with minimal impact to the LCS architecture. Furthermore, the requested license renewals and software support are specificallydesignated to be compliant with the existing licensed software products, operatingsystems, and hardware platforms, and cannot be substituted with another manufacturersproduct.

Title of Project:  "Structural Steel Repair/Lead Paint Abatement on Primary Elevator Shaft."  Drawings indicate "Elevator Repair"
Description:  This project will restore lost structural integrity by replacing the steel supporting the interior of a 53 year-old passenger elevator shaft at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in Eddy County, New Mexico.  Project work includes replacement of 163 sections of heavily-corroded structural steel framing, some of which are covered with rust and lead based paint debris.  Lead paint abatement will occur as part of the work on some of the structural steel.  Most of the support beams inside the elevator shaft will be replaced with new galvanized steel members.  Other components that will be replaced and/or repaired are wall anchors, guide rails for the elevators, rail clips and cross bracing.  All work will be performed inside an existing 750 foot limestone elevator shaft with limited access only at the top and bottom of the shaft.  Park visitation will continue during construction, therefore the contractor will be required to comply with regulations on building access, noise control and other environmental constraints to encapsulate the lead dust and other construction debris.  The contractor will be required to provide air containment materials and procedures to avoid introducing air-borne contaminants into the cave.
A large parking area adjacent to the Visitor Center building will be available to the contractor for staging, storage of materials and a contractor office trailer.  The existing elevator cabs will be lowered to the bottom of the shaft prior to commencement of work.  Access to the elevator shaft for lowering the beam sections will require navigating corners and changing direction with steel sections while they are suspended.  Transportation of equipment, materials and laborers shall be accomplished via work platform that can travel the height of the shaft. The plan dimensions of the shaft are approximately 11 feet by 17 feet, which will be occupied by two elevator cabs (at the bottom) and the supporting steel, counterweights (at the top), hoist cables and anchorages.  The existing elevator hoist cables, cabs and hoist machinery will be left in place during the construction period.
Removal of existing steel will require contractor to chip existing beam ends from grouted beam pockets in the limestone shaft.  The steel to be removed from the elevator shaft shall be hoisted to the top of the shaft opening and be removed without damaging surrounding elevator cables, electrical controls and other building components or cave features.  The steel to be removed may be cut for handling.  Recycling of the steel will be required.  Since the contractor will be working inside an elevator shaft, fall protection and compliance with OSHA standards will be required.  New beams will be re-grouted into existing beam pockets and new wall anchors may require drilled or grouted connections to reconstruct the wall anchor assembly.
At the end of the project, the contractor will be required to re-align the existing guide rails that support the two counterweights and the two elevator cars.  A certified elevator inspector will be required for this portion of the work.
Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit:  An organized pre-proposal conference/site visit will be held on March 24, 2010.  Exact meeting place and time will be identified in the solicitation documents.  SPECIAL NOTE:  Offerors desiring to view the elevator shaft from on top of the elevator cab, will be required to wear hard hats, steel toed boots, and have appropriate/adequate fall protection.  Offerors will be required to provide these items themselves.
Type of Procurement:  A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
Estimated price range:  $4,500,000.00 - $5,500,000.00.
Time for completion:  Completion date is March 15, 2011 (tentative).  The full construction Notice to Proceed will be issued on September 13, 2010 (approximately).  An administrative Notice to Proceed will be issued approximately 90 days prior to that in order to begin steel fabrication and work on other submittal requirements. 
Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
In order to be considered for award, all large businesses will be required to submit an acceptable Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal.   The NPS will not accept a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that does not guarantee that a minimum of 10% of the total contract value will be subcontracted to small business, which will be monitored and enforced during construction performance.  The NPS subcontracting goals for Fiscal Year 2010 for the participation of small businesses at a minimum are as follows:  Small Business Concerns - 19.5%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns - 3%; Small Women-Owned Business Concerns - 5%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns - 3%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns - 3%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns - 3%; 8(a) concerns - 2.5%.   
Small Disadvantaged Business and  HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns  and  52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

In order to meet the program office needs, Dr. Kastens will be tasked with either developing (1) ?R? programs for FLDPLN model execution; or, (2) with a stand-alone, royalty-free FLDPLN model user interface.  Period of performance for this order will be 12 months from date of award.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide the requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFQ will be ignored.  No RFP/RFQ will be made available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Force Health Protection Program of the Warfighter Performance Department at the Office of Naval Research (Code 342) is soliciting white papers and full proposals for Multifunctional Resuscitation Fluid. White Papers are desired for all offerors seeking FY 2011 initial funding.  
The objective of this effort is to obtain FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) approval and completion of a Phase I clinical trial for a multifunctional resuscitation fluid (MRF) product.  The MRF will replace lost blood volume, provide oxygen to tissues, and replace coagulation factors lost during bleeding to prevent further blood loss.  The product will not require refrigeration.  The product will have a long shelf-life, be easily reconstituted (if dried) and administered, restore intravascular volume, provide oxygen to tissues, and restore coagulation factors lost due to hemorrhage.

It is anticipated that award will be in the form of cost-type contract, specifically Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with cost-type Task Orders made off of those IDIQs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857, UNITED STATES

Description

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start, through the Program Support Center (PSC), has a requirement to procure State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, to the maximum extent practicable, improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that meet or exceed the standards described in section 641 (A)(a)(1) of the Head Start Act, within the following areas:

	School readiness
	Training/career development needs of staff
	Correction of deficiencies

The Office of Head Start is seeking the procurement of up to 52 State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will secure services of at least one Early Childhood Education specialist in every state of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico who possess demonstrable and credible experience in the field of early childhood education. Specific expertise is sought from offerors providing training and technical assistance strategies that positively impact the developmental and educational outcomes for children birth to five. 

Each state will include at least one early childhood education (ECE) specialist, with the number of ECE specialists increased in accord with the number of grantees and delegates within a state. The work of these specialists will be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff. In each state one ECE specialist shall function as the Center Manager. 

The Early Childhood Education (ECE) specialist position requires a degree and qualifications in Early Childhood Education/Development at the bachelors degree level with masters degree preferred and a minimum of five years experience in programs for young children. In states with only one ECE specialist, the degree and experience for that specialist must be inclusive of both birth to three and three to five year old development and learning. This experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and education managers.  For states staffed by more than one ECE specialist, the education and experience of one specialist may be specific to children from birth to three; the education and experience of the second specialist may be specific to children from three to five. For states staffed by more than one specialist, it is also recommended that each specialist have experience and/or education with the implementation of effective strategies for working with unique special populations of children. 

In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of at least one Grantee Specialist for each of the ten ACF Regions. These specialists will be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. In regions with few grantees with identified deficiencies, the grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or with grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Program Information Report (PIR). In order to facilitate and support close communication between these grantee specialists and the regional office, these specialists will be employed by the TTA Center in the State where the regional office is located. 

These states are as follows:

	Region I  Massachusetts
	Region II  New York
	Region II  Philadelphia
	Region IV  Georgia
	Region V  Illinois
	Region VI  Texas
	Region VII  Missouri
	Region VIII  Colorado
	Region IX  California
	Region X - Washington

The Grantee Specialist position requires a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (BA or BS) Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; and experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees. Both positions, the Early Childhood Specialist and the Grantee Specialist, require a significant background in the use of reliable data collection systems that track measurable outcomes for children and programs.

Finally, there will be one TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist for each of the ten regions. (See above.) As is true with the grantee specialists, this individual will be employed by the state Center in which the regional office is located. The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist will work with regional office staff to coordinate the work of the State TTA Centers within that region. 

The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist requires a BA or BS Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees.

The number of Early Childhood Education Specialists, Grantee Specialists, and TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialists depend upon the number of grantees and delegates per state.  Attachment 1 provides the estimated level of effort in each state.

Offerors may propose staff that lives near, but not in, the state for which the capability statement is being written. However, it is required that all individuals have some relationships established with the early education community in that state.

To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof.  

In states  where less than three Early Childhood Education Specialists are to be proposed (see Section 3.1.1 (b)  Contraints  Staffing Based on Size of Head Start Programs by State),  offerors are encouraged to propose a consortium of two or more states situated within that ACF Region in order to maximize resources. Consortium proposals are subject to the Regional restrictions below:

Region 1:  No consortium shall include Maine or Rhode Island but any other combination of Region 1 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 2:  No consortium shall include Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands but any other combination of Region 2 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 3:  No consortium shall include Delaware, Pennsylvania, or Washington, D.C., but any other combination of Region 3 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 4:  No consortium shall include Mississippi or South Carolina nor a combination of Tennessee and Kentucky but any other combination of Region 4 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 5:  Any combination of Region 5 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 6:  No consortium shall include Arkansas or New Mexico but any other combination of Region 6 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 7:  No consortium shall include Iowa but any other combination of Region 7 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 8:  No consortium shall include North Dakota or South Dakota nor a combination of Montana with Colorado or Utah but any other combination of Region 8 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 9:  No consortium shall include any states in Region 9.

<p>Geothermal for District Heating and Cooling Feasibility Study.</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Geothermal for District Heating and Cooling project.</p>
<p>Today, Palestinians are paying the highest energy prices in the entire Middle East and North Africa. In addition, Palestinians are experiencing population growth rates that are amongst the highest in the world: 3.99% in Gaza and 2.9% in the West Bank. The West Bank has no sources of natural energy and it is largely dependent on Israeli sources, with some power coming from Jordan. If this situation continues, Palestinians living in the West Bank will continue to face significant energy problems.</p>
<p>Building construction remains one of the main industries in the West Bank and as a result, building loads make up a significant portion of energy consumption in the West Bank. As 60% of the energy consumed by a typical building is for heating and cooling, MENA Geothermal Ground Energy and Investment Company Ltd. (MENA), a private Palestinian business registered in the West Bank that specializes in the design and installation of residential and commercial geothermal heating and cooling systems, has focused on lowering the outside cost of this energy component, thereby creating the largest energy savings impact on its buildings. The most common conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in the West Bank are diesel-powered boilers for heating, which burn fossil-fuels and directly produce CO2 emissions. With the current energy prices in the West Bank, operating costs for conventional systems, especially diesel-powered boilers, have become a major burden for most Palestinians living in the West Bank.</p>
<p>For the planned 500-unit housing development, MENA and Union Construction and Investment Corp. (UCI), which is a partial owner of MENA, are planning to install a centrally located district geothermal heating and cooling system that would supply HVAC throughout the development. A district geothermal heating and cooling system would be more economical than installing individual geothermal systems for each household. This way all 500 units can receive heating and cooling energy from a renewable source, reducing the entire development's energy consumption by 70% and significantly reducing CO2 emissions. This is also expected to produce significant capital and operating cost reductions for the individual units.</p>
<p>The proposed Feasibility Study would include: a detailed assessment of the thermal conductivity of the proposed site, economic analysis of the use of geothermal energy, a design of the district system, training on the potential system, operating cost savings analysis, financial modeling and an implementation plan. Implementation of this technology will help achieve the goal of increasing the use of clean and renewable sources of energy and decreasing dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$438,162 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and a grantee cost share of US$20,489, for a total Project budget cost of US$458,651.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or the West Bank. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the West Bank for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM Local Time, April 15, 2010 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a promise to issue a formal solicitation or a Broad Area Announcement (BAA) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Also, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought Notice or otherwise pay for information submitted or inquiries or the Government's use of such information. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future procurement. In the event a future procurement is released, it will be released via the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of interested sources to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is a Federal Government agency within the Executive Branch that oversees U.S. broadcasting of news and information to audiences around the world. BBG includes the Voice of America (VOA) and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) as well as grantee entities Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the Middle East Broadcasting Network (MBN). These BBG organizations are broadcasters that together distribute programming in 60 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 175 million people. BBG's programming is delivered using almost every available platform including, but not limited to radio, TV, Internet and mobile phone technology.
<p>In order to enhance its international research methods for assessing its audience and broadcasting mission, BBG is conducting market research to ascertain the existence of sources having the demonstrated capability of providing international audience and media research so that BBG will be better able to: 1) Update and broaden its scope of what is currently possible in audience and media research; 2) Identify what best practices should be brought to bear in an anticipated future procurement; 3) Determine the type and kind of contract that will be best suited to BBG's complex research requirements; 4) Determine the type of analytics that will best serve the BBG's interests; and 5) Find out from those who respond that have done international audience and media research the existence of recommended practices that may be in the best interest of the Government. The information below is provided to help those sources who are interested in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>One of the methods that BBG utilizes to meet its mission is customized polling and market research to: 1) Reliably measure the size and nature of its audience; 2) Evaluate the performance of existing programming; and 3) Provide information to be used to create compelling new programming. In accordance with its mission, and those of the above broadcasters, and its overall strategic goals and requirement for regular language and program reviews, the BBG uses its comprehensive research to track a wide range of indicators, among which it has identified three (3) principal measures for official reporting: 1) The percentage of the national populations that programming reaches weekly, 2) News reliability, and 3) Increased audience understanding of current affairs and related issues.</p>
<p>BBG obtains the majority of its research through a single, firm-fixed-priced (FFP) competitively awarded contract with a total anticipated amount of $50 million dollars that is called the International Audience Research Program (IARP). The Contractor is InterMedia Survey Institute, 1401 New York Avenue NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20005. Under this contract, which has a remaining option year that if exercised will extend the existing services through September 2011, BBG has undertaken individual research projects, including national and sub-national surveys of media consumption and preference, focus groups, depth-interviews, consumer monitoring panels, market scans, ethnographic observation and other forms of research. Typically, each research project will be accompanied by statistical top-lines, analysis reports, technical reports, broadcaster and executive-level presentations which occur at least annually for each BBG language service. These research products are delivered to and reviewed by Research Directors that service the applicable BBG language service. This contract also allows for a contractor-maintained web portal for access to raw data and analytic products, and the research takes place all over the world, including areas where it may be difficult to access populations. Standards for research are currently maintained by the Conference of International Broadcasting Audience Researchers (CIBAR) and are generally consistent with the standards of private industry groups such as the European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR) and the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR).</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background. On October, 9, 2008, The World Health Organization (WHO) launched its Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) which aims at scaling up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in countries especially with low- and middle-income populations, thus to reduce the significant gap between the minority who do receive these services and the majority that don't. The program asserts that with proper care, psychosocial assistance and medication, tens of millions could be treated for depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, prevented from suicide and begin to lead normal lives- even where resources are scarce.</p>
<p>Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) will provide health planners, policy-makers, and donors with a set of clear and coherent activities and programs for scaling up care for mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all small businesses capable of developing, implementing, and evaluating the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP).</p>
<p>One goal of this initiative will be to conduct comparative research on the implementation and scale-up of evidence-based mental health interventions in low- and middle-income settings (LMICs). The mhGAP initiative aims to deliver an integrated package of evidence-based interventions taking into account existing and possible barriers for scaling up care. The interventions focus on eight (8) high disease burden and high cost conditions, including depression, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, suicide, and mental disorders in children. Through this initiative, the NIMH stands to make a significant impact on the treatment and course of mental disorders in LMICs by supporting a program of multidisciplinary research on implementation of effective interventions and comparative studies in multiple country settings.</p>
<p>The overarching priority of this initiative is the development of sound methods to study the implementation of evidence-based packages of mental health care in low- and middle-income countries. To that end, formative field studies will be designed to address four (4) broad goals: (1) Understanding the social and policy environments that facilitate scale up of mental health interventions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; (2) Studying cultural barriers and facilitators of scale up; (3)Assessment of the acceptability and social validity of individual and combined packages of care across settings as well as across populations at risk of exclusion from services; and (4) Refinement of methods to assess the efficacy of multilevel intervention implementation.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements. Qualified sources will be required to: 1) develop protocols for a situational analysis for implementation of mhGAP; 2) conduct a situational analysis of the mental health system in 3-5 selected LMICs; 3) based on the situational analyses, develop protocols for implementation research on mhGAP; and 4) evaluate the implementation process in the selected LMICs.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have:</p>
<p>1) Access to the collaborative research networks developed in the WHO-AIMS study (see http://www.who.int/en/) in order to develop protocols for implementation of World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program<br /><br />2) The infrastructure to establish international field study centers in 3-5 low- and middle-income countries (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Asia)</p>
<p>3) Current international collaborations with investigators who have a record of productive research focused on mental health services research and implementation science in LMICs</p>
<p>4) Experience/expertise in epidemiology, intervention and implementation science, and mixed methods research.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 3 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement. Any small business organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project. Also include respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>

<p><br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal. The responses to this Synopsis will be used as a market research tool in order to identify specific small business categorical firms for the purpose of determining how the upcoming solicitation will be advertised. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. If the Government does issue a solicitation, it will be assigned a Procurement Identification Number such as W9127S-10-R-XXXX.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS: The project consists of Design/Build Construction, Renovation and Repair for U.S. Air Force Medical Service healthcare facilities. An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Task Order contract is anticipated. A priority responsibility is facility sustainment, restoration and modernization (SRM), which includes the emergency, urgent and routine repairs, planned renovation, construction and maintenance of hospitals, clinics, administrative buildings, health facilities, warehouse, veterinary clinics, ancillary facilities and wellness centers. All work in this area is classified as Engineering Infrastructure Repair (EIR) and includes Electrical Infrastructure Systems, Mechanical Infrastructure Systems and Building Envelope, Architectural and Structural Infrastructure Systems.</p>
<p>Electrical Infrastructure Systems includes power generation systems, interior and exterior electrical distribution systems, lighting systems (to include control), fire detection and alarm systems, energy metering and control systems, main power protective grounding systems, emergency and exit lighting systems, lightening protection systems, uninterruptable power supplies and battery systems, power transformers, conduits, raceways and bus-ducts, special healthcare specific electrical system.</p>
<p>Mechanical Infrastructure Systems include all aspects of: (a) Heating Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration - chilled water production systems (electric, absorption and mechanical), DX refrigeration systems, steam and hot water production (boilers, geothermal, solar), heat exchangers, plate and frame free coolers, condenser cooling towers, tempered water distribution systems (pumps, valves, air bleed systems, water treatment systems), air distribution and exhaust systems (air handlers, fans, filters, louvers, variable air volume boxes, mixing boxes, desiccant wheels, energy wheels, etc.), chilled and hot water distribution systems (coils, piping, insulation, bleeding, building automation and space environmental (temperature, humidity, air purity and pressurization) controls (DDC control systems, field control devices, actuators, sensing devices, programmable logic controls and software systems); (b) Plumbing Systems - pressured and non-pressured water systems (potable, non-potable, waste and process) which include water sterilization, potable hot water distribution and recirculation, cooled drinking water delivery systems, dire suppression distribution and sprinkler systems, gray water collection and distribution systems, sanitary waster systems, roof drains, collection tanks, sewage ejectors, fixtures, valves, pumps, controllers, strainers and other plumbing ancillaries; (c) Medical Gas and Vacuum Systems - production, distribution, control and waste elimination of volatile/non-volatile, medical gases, medical pressurized air for instruments, medical air vacuum systems, medical bio-hazardous and infectious air control, ventilation and exhaust systems, distributed breathing air systems to include the piping, valves, pumps, motors, compressors, filtration systems and other ancillaries required to complete the system.</p>
<p>Building Envelope, Architectural and Structural Infrastructure Systems - various roofing systems (to include metal), exterior walls and surfaces (masonry, wood, EFIS (Exterior Insulation Finishing System), metal, etc.), building trim, gutters and soffit, windows, glazing, skylights, doors and storefronts, interior and exterior rated doors (to include fixtures and frames), building foundation, crawl space sub-structures/earth retaining walls, stairs, stoops, handrails, ramps, pathways and walkways, vapor barriers, surface sealing and waterproofing systems, roof mounted photovoltaic solar panels, anti-terrorism force protection features and other exterior building components.</p>
<p>The work will also include an Emergency Response feature called HERO (Healthcare Emergency Recovery Operations). The HERO feature will allow the Contracting Officer and the Contractor(s) the ability to react and respond quickly, deploying expeditionary resources necessary to provide initial response and limited recovery to unforeseen natural/unnatural events or major system failures that threaten or place the lives and well-being of the patients, staff, mission and/or facility in continued harm's way or peril. HERO will also apply where a major system failure has made the facility unusable by a major medical mission unless temporary or interim measures are employed. When such events arise, whether they be wide-spread natural catastrophes (hurricanes, floods, etc.) or local events (tornados, fires, system failures, etc.) which pose an imminent threat to the public or mission impediment, the Contracting Officer may (at the written request of AFMS explaining the urgency, justification and interim objective sought) execute the HERO feature with an immediate verbal Notice to Proceed. The Contractor(s) must provide, and not exceed, the pre-negotiated mark-up/profit over costs for project management, administration, travel, labor, materials and other direct cots that might be expended under HERO services.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the IDIQ will be for a period of one (1) base year and four (4) option years, not to exceed five (5) years. The magnitude of construction is estimated at $300,000,000.00 over a five-year period. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, which corresponds to SIC 1542. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 million. The results of this market research will determine set-asides, if any.</p>

Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, and Evaluation of Treatment & Prevention in Cancer Research Program at Pennsylvania State University requires an ionization chamber for conducting Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy (IMAT) and Tomotherapy tests.<BR> <BR>The required ionization chamber has the following salient characteristics:<BR>"	Material: Polystyrene, density 1.04 g/cm <BR>"	Size: Octagon, diameter 320 mm, length 320 mm<BR>"	Weight Approx. 24 kg and approx. 26 kg <BR>"	Used with IMAT and Tomotherapy systems<BR>"	Chamber Plate included with system<BR>"	Can be used to determine Normal Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for patient plans.<BR>"	Measurement values are recorded in software and directly compared to treatment planning system data.<BR>"	Has a semicircular cavity built in to compensate for rear-facing irradiation.<BR><BR>2.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Systems such as Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy (IMAT) and Tomotherapy need a method to verify pretreatment for patient plans. Ionizations chambers can provide verification calculating dosage by pretesting patient plans against treatment planning values. The ionization chamber that is manufactured by PTW the Octavious Phantom has been cited as a reliable measure for verifying rotational patient treatments*. The ionization chamber with treatment data is exposed to the CT scan, associated software does the recalculations reducing time for treatment verification.  PTW does not appear to have licensed there methods or technology to any other manufacturer; therefore PTW is the only source for ionization chamber Octavious Phantom based equipment.<BR><BR>*http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.2777006<BR><BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A search was conducted between 4 Feb and 10 Feb 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search. The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 423450 Medical, Dental, and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers and keywords ionization chamber.<BR>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned no small businesses associated with both the NAICS 423450 and any of the relevant keywords.<BR>Internet research found that the model that best meet the salient characteristics of the ionization chamber is available from a single vendor. While there are ionization chamber systems are available on the market they do not fit the salient characteristics.

This year the Benefits Conference will have a vendor exhibit area on May 5 and 6. The purpose of the training is to update the group on initiatives in the area, share information among agencies about actions some have taken to deal with benefits education, increased workloads, etc., and address crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, Social Security, workers compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. In addition, this years event will feature a 2   day conference, Benefits Across the Ages (held on May 5, 6 and  day on the 7th), which will include the 4th Annual Symposium on Retirement Financial Education and Federal retirement and benefits related plenary and breakout sessions. This 2  day conference will have general sessions of interest to all, providing an overview of our retirement financial education programs as well as news and updates on current Federal benefits programs. In the past approximately a third of the attendees were Federal agency headquarters level staff with responsibility for administering the benefits programs within their agencies. The other attendees were field staff with benefits administration responsibilities at the field level. We anticipate approximately 475 agency representatives to attend this event. 

Up to 25 exhibit spaces are available. Exhibitors will rent the space directly from PowerTrain Inc, who is acting on OPMs behalf to manage the exhibit booths and facilitate set up and dismantle with the on-site display company.

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROGRAM. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center For Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adult and Community Health (DACH), Office of the Director- American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Unit, intend to issue a limited source competition under GSA MOBIS SIN 874-1 for the customization of an existing system dynamic methodology used to create the Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM) and to be further used to forecast the impact of policy, systems, and environmental changes in approximately 43 communities funded under the ARRA Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) initiative. The eligible sources are: 1) Research Triangle Institute (RTI), Research Triangle, NC; 2) Macro International, Inc., Beltsville, MD</p>
<p>The limited source competition for this procurement is based on specialized capability, capacity and detailed knowledge of how the PRISM model operates, how the variables are inter-related, and how to make adjustments to the model without compromising system integrity. Due to the distinctive requirements and specialized knowledge, the services contemplated for this acquisition cannot be purchased through utilizing alternative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to have a working model that will be used to help communities and the CDC forecast the projected impact of community efforts on long-term risk behaviors for chronic diseases and health outcomes that are expected to occur as a result of policy, systems, and environmental changes. This model will build on the existing PRISM model.</p>
<p>Work to be carried out under this award will accomplish the following objectives:<br />1) Compile, from existing sources, necessary demographic information from each ARRA-CPPW funded community in order to refine the existing Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM); 2) Develop customized versions of the core PRISM model that better reflect the situation in specific funded communities or like communities; 3) Create computer simulations to demonstrate the future trajectories for forecasts of community health impact on chronic diseases at specific time intervals during the period of performance; and 4) Interact with each funded CPPW community to provide assistance in interpretation of model findings and use of model findings and reports.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available. The Statement of Work will be issued to the selected vendors in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 ordering procedures. Please direct all questions regarding this requirement in writing to the Point of Contact identified in the synopsis.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Thirty-Six (36) months from date of award.</p>

A sole source, fixed price contract with Medical Resources may be awarded, dependent upon availability of funds on or around February 25, 2010. Department of Veterans AffairsVISN 10Justification and Approval 1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity:   Justification for other than full and open competition for the Department of Veterans Affairs, 4100 W. Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428-9000; VISN 10 Contracting Activity. Purchase Request No. 552-10-2-6975-00152.	Nature/Description of Action:   The Contracting Officer intends to issue a firm-fixed price sole source contract to Medical Resources (a division of EOI, Inc).   3.	Description of Supplies/Services (include estimated Value):  The requirement is to provide material, equipment, labor, and training  to install a temperature monitoring system throughout the VA Medical Center and 4 CBOC's.  4.	Identification of Statutory Authority (Choose One):   (X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1)(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2)(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     			Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	 Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requiring Use of the Authority Cited:  The Check Point monitoring system is currently being used by several services at this Medical Center. The infrastructure of the system is already in place and the additional sensors can be installed at a minimal cost to the Medical Center. Any system other than Check Point would require a complete new system. The software used by Check Point is not compatible with any other temperature monitoring system. The contractor, (Medical Resources) has been given VPN remote access to our network, by OI&T. Many employees at this facility are already familiar with the Check Point programs. The Medical Center's Bio-Medical, OI&T and Engineering Service are already familiar with the Check Point systems maintenance requirements. Medical Resources is a local company and guarantees availability of parts and service.  Medical Resources past performance has been excellent. They also hold a GSA schedule contract. 6.  Solicitation of Potential Resources:   The Contracting Officer did not solicit for potential resources due to the unique requirements of the Check Point system and the need to tie into this existing system. .7.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost:  The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the government is fair and reasonable because prices are below established catalog prices on GSA contract GS-07F-0031T and are comparable with prices paid on the initial install delivery order at this station in 2008.8.	Description of market survey and any interested sources. If no market survey was conducted, state the reason:  A market survey was conducted using GSA Advantage, and eCMS archived contract documents was conducted to determine what sources have provided these services and to provide a base for price comparison.9.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:  a.	Medical Resources is the only known source. I have no knowledge of any other company that can provide the Check Point  system except Medical Resources. There are other companies that have similar temperature monitoring systems, but they would not be compatible with the system that we already have in operation at the Medical Center. The software used by Medical Resources for their Check Point system will not communicate with any of the competitor's equipment.b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated (describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent OR unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements:  N/A  c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:  N/A10.	Sources expressing an interest:  N/A.11.  Actions taken to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services required:    None.CertificationThe information contained in this justification for other than full and open competition is certified accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Acquisition Initiator:                                       I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate. ____________________     __________     Signature                                DateContracting Officer:I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Maritime Administration intends to enter into a contract with Lions Beard Marine, LLC, on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i) as a means of evaluating a unique and innovative approach developed by the company to reduce the build-up of marine infestation on vessel hulls that typically requires costly, periodic scamping and or drydocking to remove. The agency has completed a favorable comprehensive evaluation of an unsolicited proposal and believes (1) the approach proposed is not available from another source, (2) the methodology does not closely resemble a pending competitive acquisition, (3) the intended results relate directly the the agency's mission of economically maintaining deep-sea vessels that are primarily in long-term lay-up, and (4) the proposed method has reasonable potential as an innovative and unique approach for mitigating the adverse effects of marine infestation on vessel hulls.</p>
<p>The agency considers that the specific services proposed by Lions Beard Marine are only available from one source inasmuch as the company submitted its proposal as an unsolicited research proposal to demonstrate the concept in a practical environment.&nbsp; The concept, described in some detail on the firm's website at http://www.lionsbeard.com/, uses different baskets of frequencies to induce barnacles not to adhere to a vessel's hull.</p>
<p>All responsible sources that feel they should be considered qualified to provide the foregoing product may submit a response to this notice within fifteen (15) days of synopsis publication to Ms. Monique R. Leake at Monique.Leake@dot.gov. All information received within fifteen (15) calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Information furnished shall include enough detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is an amendment to a previous announcement E7482100007 and E748210A007.  This amendment is to attach the J&A that did not attach to the previous/original announcement.
This notice is for informational purposes only.  The National Park Service, Lakewood, CO intends to solicit an action for supplies or services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This sole source award is for specialized underwater breathing equipment; mixed-gas, closed circuit rebreathers for utilization of a single diving system.  This newly developed equipment is cutting edge for safety in diving; mixed gas CCRs provide the SRC the ability to utilize a single diving system across a broad range of diving environments spanning from shallow sites in warm water to deep cold environments requiring mixed gas capabilities to access safely and efficiently. Mixed gases represents the state of the art for occupational diving and represent a significant increase in employee health concerns developed from a career-long exposure to diving.  This equipment is specific for life, health, and safety.  
This award will be made with the justification for restricting competition in accordance with Federal Acquisitions Regulation FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals (features as noted). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement. All inquiries on this action can be submitted in writing by facsimile at (303)-969-2992, or email to robin_anderson@nps.gov. (Phone calls will not be accepted).
 All submissions shall be submitted no later than March 5, 2010 at 4:00 PM MT.  This is NOT a request for proposals.

                                                    JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION                                                                          VR Technologies November 25, 2009
1.	AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: NATIONAL PARK SERVICE Submerged Resources Center                         12795 West Alameda Parkway Lakewood, CO 082282.	NATURE OF ACTION: Requesting approval to use other than full and open competition procedures to for:                VR Technologies Sentinel Expedition mixed gas closed circuit rebreather scuba diving systems                 (two units)3.	DESCRIPTION:The Submerged Resources Center (SRC) has identified the need to acquire two mixed-gas, closed circuit rebreathers (CCRs) to assist if fulfilling its mandate of assessing, documenting and monitoring submerged sites throughout the NPS systems to support the NPS mission in park units containing submerged jurisdiction. Mixed gas CCRs provide the SRC the ability to utilize a single diving system across a broad range of diving environments spanning from shallow sites in warm water to deep cold environments requiring mixed gas capabilities to access safely and efficiently. Mixed gases represents the state of the art for occupational diving and represent a significant increase in employee health concerns developed from a career-long exposure to diving. VR Technologies Sentinel Expedition rebreathers offer the latest's, and safest suite of mechanical and electronic advancements to maximize SRC safe diving operations. Specifically, these units offer an on-board CO2 monitoring system (see #5 below) which is an industry first and available by no other manufacture worldwide.VR Technologies Sentinel Expedition: Two complete VR Technologies electronics w/vibrating HUD, CO2 monitoring system, Variable Gradient Model decompression software, off-board gas connection kit, and Intelligent Secondary display Sentenial Expdition Rebreathers.

1.	AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as stated in FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source, VR                 Technologies, and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements.2.	PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)): VR Technology is the only rebreather manufacture to provide the worlds' first inrebreather CO2 sensing system, therefore increasing SRC diver safety.Sentinel rebreathers contain a sensor system to provide an additional level of confidence in monitoring CO2 absorbent usage. The absence of CO2 monitoring can cause diver blackout and subsequent death. The system has the following advantages over currently available canister monitoring techniques; 1) Predicts failures in the CO2 sealing system 2) Shows filter `bypass' as it occurs 3) Instantly shows `no filter' fitted 4) Displays current CO2 level within the breathing loop 5) Warns the diver to reduce their work rate or depth to avoid a dangerously high CO2 level occurring Rebreathers, including the models the SRC are currently diving, have always suffered from the lack of CO2 detection. The VR Technologies Sentinel Expedition provides complete confidence in the CO2 absorbent status at all times. The fact that VR Technologies is the only manufacturer to provide this level of CO2 monitoring while in the working dive environment justifies a sole source acquisition.
1.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL        SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)): This requirement could not be solicited to any other                 vendors as the requirement is for CO2 monitoring systems within the rebreather diving system which no                 other manufacturer offers. No other vendor is available to solicit for CO2 monitoring as stated above. A                 notice of intent to award sole source will be publicized as required by FAR 5.207(a)(14).2.	ANTICIPATED COSTS TO THE GOVERNMENT/ FAIR AND REASONABLENESS (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)): A      separate determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair                 and reasonable.3.	MARKET RESEARCH (FAR 6.303-2(2)(8)): Extensive research was accomplished which no other      feasible sources were found. VR Technologies was found to be the exclusive source for the                 requirement.
4.	OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR                 6.303-2(a)(9)): VR Technologies is the only available source for this requirement.5.	ACTION, IF ANY, BEING TAKEN TO REMOVE AND OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED (FAR 6.303-2(A)(11)): Additional market research and sources sought  wilLbe_conducted-if-subsequent-acquisitions-for_supplies-or-services-are-r-equir-ed.6.	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.3032(b)): I hereby certify that this          justification and approval for other than full and open competition is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement. I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.

12. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)): I hereby certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>RECOVERY
Mesa Verde National Park intends to award a sole source acquisition, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) to:
Trams International, 6801 Suva Street, Bell Gardens, CA 90201
Trams International is one of only two tram/tug manufacturers that currently produce a tram power car and trailer combination that operates on a wide-variety of fuels including biodiesel that would meet the public transportation operating requirements of Mesa Verde National Park.  The only other manufacturer would require five trailers to connect with a tug tow-tractor that is not designed for off-road public transit operation and is not recommended given that the application at Mesa Verde National Park is an off-road public transportation operation.  More importantly, Trams International is the only vehicle manufacturer in the United States that currently produces a tram power car that operates on electricity that would meet the public transportation operating requirements of Mesa Verde National Park.  As the Value Analysis directs the use of both biodiesel and electric trams, sourcing with one manufacturer becomes appropriate to enable efficient interconnectivity of power cars and trailers.

2) Provide temporary wiring in the Radio Building (see attached site plan) to maintain power in the building during the assessment of the manhole.  This will involve lockout/tag out of two (2) existing 480 V 150 Amp feeders, one (1) in the Boiler House (see attached site plan) and one (1) in Load Center # 4 that serves load in this building.  Install 480 V 150 Amp temporary wiring from the existing primary disconnect for DTT-RA-2 to the existing primary disconnect for DTT-RA-1.  The room in the Radio Building where the two transformers (DTT-RA-1 and DTT-RA-2) are both located is ten feet (10') X fifteen feet (15').3) Make all the necessary connections to serve DTT-RA-1 from the existing primary feeder to DTT-RA-2.  Once Manhole assessment is completed, contractor will remove all temporary wiring and restore all services back to their original condition.  Contractor shall maintain proper phasing of conductors during each stage.  Maximum outage time for the Radio Building is two (2) hours total.
General Services.  Investigate and report on the general conditions of the manhole, the condition of electrical distribution systems associated with the manhole, and the condition of the fiber optic cable distribution associated with the manhole.
General Conditions of the Manhole.
1) De-energize all power cables.  Apply applicable lockout/tag out requirements.2) Check for dangerous gases using a properly calibrated test meter before entering any confined space.3) Inspect cable for sharp bends, physical damage, excessive tension, oil leaks, pits, cable movement, soft spots, cracked jackets, damaged fireproofing, poor ground connections, deteriorated and corroded or weakened cable supports.4) Inspect for cable wear at entrance point and at supports.5) Inspect manhole for spalled concrete, proper ventilation and excessive moisture.6) Check condition of manhole floor drainage and sump pit.7) Check that pulling eyes are located opposite of raceways.8) Check that that manhole cover is stamped clearly thereon with the word ?Electric?.9) Inspect potheads for oil or compound leakage and for cracked/chipped porcelain.10) Examine the manhole and cable grounding system to ensure its integrity.11) If cathodic protection has been installed, evaluate its condition. 
Power System
1) Check that at each splice and termination point, all shields, ground conductor, etc., are bonded to a ground rod.2) Check that all cables are identified, at the point of entry into the manhole with legible tags.  Tags should indicate circuit origin, phase, and destination when terminating at splices.  Cables that pass through the manhole should have tags with circuit origin and destination information.  In addition, at locations where phase indication is required, indication shall be by the use of color-coded electrical tape.3) Check that driven ground rod has a maximum resistance of 25 ohms.  Check that ground rod is cad-welded to the grounding conductor and is connected to a fully closed loop of grounding conductor that is used to bond all splices and non-current carrying electrical equipment in the manhole.  Check that grounding connections to racks are made with listed connectors suitable for the purpose.  Check that the loop of grounding conductors is between 12 inches and 24 inches above the floor of the manhole and is securely attached to the wall.4) Check that cable in the manhole is properly insulated, on suitable racks, and properly secured.5) Check that cable is properly fireproofed.6) Check that the length of any cable in the manhole is not less than the circumference of the interior of the manhole.  For a length of cable that splices or terminates within the manhole, the minimum length of one manhole circumference shall be determined from the point where the cable enters, or exits, the manhole to the splice or termination.7) Check that abandoned cables have been physically removed from the manhole.8) Check that combination power and communication manholes are avoided if possible and that fiber cable is installed in the underground power conduit system if three or more spare power conduits are available between two manholes.
Fiber Optic Cable
1) Check that bending radius does not exceed thirteen inches.2) Check that the number of ninety degree turns on a pull does not exceed four.3) Check that 150 feet of cable is coiled at the transition, termination points, and every 1500 feet.4) Note for repair all nicks and cuts in the cable.5) Confirm that the fiber cables in Manhole # 1 are constructed entirely of non-conducting, all dielectric materials for installation around high voltage lines. Fiber Optic Cable (continued)
6) Although fiber cable is made entirely of non-conducting materials, under certain conditions it is still capable of having induced or static charges on its surface.  A static surface charge can be dangerous if touched bare handed.  To insure the safety of field operations personnel, check that all fiber cable installed in the manhole is grounded.  Fiber cable is more susceptible to crushing than regular conductors, so proper grounding techniques should be verified.7) Check that the fiber cable is protected from underground electrical conductor arc and burn, which may include wrapping with fire retardant tape and fire resistant cloth bags for extra cable coils.8) Check that fiber cable, coils, and splices are kept in the bottom of the manhole so as to be out of the way of the electrical conductors and equipment.9) Check that manholes containing fiber are marked externally and permanently adjacent to the manhole.
Compliance with Codes and Standards.  All studies, analyses, and recommendations must comply with the latest issues of constructions codes and standards.  Such codes shall include, but not be limited to NFPA and National Electrical Code.

<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>SAC San Diego has a fleet of approximately 530 domestic vehicles. The SAC fleet consists of small, medium and a few large vehicles that range from sedans, vans, passenger trucks and SUV's. These vehicles are routinely used for official law enforcement duties. The SAC fleet is turned over at a rate of approximately 18% annually. The specific number of storage spaces required is unknown in advance. The budget, mission and vehicle life cycles are each variables that dictate the interval in which a SAC vehicle is taken out of service.</p>
<p>The removal from fleet service for vehicles normally requires storage for about 90 days. Maintenance, service, towing, and or upkeep by the storage facility are not required in this contract. Any direct or indirect costs associated with maintaining, towing, or upkeep outside the occasional jump start, of stored vehicles are not allowed. Access to the storage facility is required during normal business hours only. All SAC vehicles must be transferred in or out of the storage facility by/with a representative from the SAC office. SAC San Diego does not require any documentation or assistance from the storage facility beyond the storage contract requirements.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>3.1 The Contractor storage facility on a daily basis shall provide outdoor spaces for the storage of operable/inoperable domestic GOVs. Indoor storage is acceptable, but at no time is SAC San Diego willing to pay more than the outdoor storage rate. The actual number of spaces used will vary between 0 to 50 spaces at any given time on a daily basis (see Attachment 1 Pricing Schedule for estimated GOVs requiring storage).</p>
<p>3.2 Access to Vehicles: The contractor storage facility shall be located within a 30 mile radius of 185 West F street San Diego, CA 92101.</p>

<p>3.5 The contractor storage facility does not have or expect to have any towing preference/contract for SAC vehicles. The contractor shall not limit, hinder or charge extra for accepting and/or releasing SAC vehicles to and or from any licensed towing service used by SAC San Diego.</p>
<p>3.6 The contracting facility shall obtain, maintain, and provide documentation of securing industry standard licenses and insurance coverage outlined by the federal, state and city regulations.</p>

The Contractor will be notified by DGR to grant access to SAC Vehicles 2 hours prior to a technician arriving to remove items. Any request to access SAC vehicles stored at the contracting facility shall be reported to the DGR or alternate DGR.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&amp;E) is responsible for leading the collection, analysis, and reporting of performance measurement information for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) mission-oriented programs. This information must meet the yearly requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and OMB Circular's A-11 and A-136. GPRA requires that Agencies' publicly reported performance measure information must be reviewed to ensure accurate data collection and reporting. OMB Circulars further stipulate that the Secretary of DHS must assert that all the performance measure information is complete and reliable when issuing Performance and Accountability related reports. During FY 2009, DHS completed a pilot project to develop and implement a methodology to assess the completeness and reliability of a small subset of its GPRA performance measures as part of a two-pronged approach to establish an internal controls process over performance information. For the purposes of this scope of work, the assessment process will be updated to include the findings of the pilot and then implemented on a larger sample of Departmental measures to include a review of remedial action implementation.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

<p>Note that this Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used to develop an acquisition strategy and future solicitation. The Air Force is considering whether to set aside this Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition for competitive 8(a), HUBZone Small Business (SB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB, or SB concerns. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on a "full and open" basis.</p>
<p>If this effort is to be set aside, then a clause such as FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will have to be expended for employees of the prime contractor.</p>
<p>All interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns are invited to respond. In order to be considered, responses must be organized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Positive statement of intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor. Include a description of how the 50% requirement would be met. Describe how anticipated subcontractors, if any, would be selected and which functions they would be responsible for.</p>
<p>2. Evidence of successful performance within the past three (3) years of no more than five (5) contract efforts similar in magnitude and scope to the work described in this notice. Include information such as contract requirements, contract amounts, performance periods, and points of contact.</p>
<p>3. Description of prime contractor's Safety and Quality Control methodologies. These descriptions should be general and not exceed two (2) pages in length each.

<p>5. Documentation of current 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, or SB status such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. If the prime contractor's certification will expire before the anticipated performance period, include a statement acknowledging that fact. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov)</p>
<p>All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns. Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor being considered &lsquo;NOT INTERESTED' in this requirement.</p>
<p>Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit their responses to the attention of Chris Scialdone, Contract Specialist (Christopher.Scialdone@rl.af.mil) with an email copy to Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist (janis.norelli@rl.af.mil).

<DESC>2/23/10-Amendment A001 issued to add Clause C.6 to add box description.  The hour and date specified for receipt of Offers is not extended.
2/16/10-The Business Declaration Form has been added as an attachment to this announcement.  All submittals require a completed Business Declaration Form.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for office relocation and furniture reconfiguration services.  The contractor shall perform all of the services required to remove office furniture, equipment, excess material, and related supplies from its present location, transport the property to the designated areas within the new location and place them at the new location.  The contractor shall furnish laborers, trucks and furniture moving equipment (e.g. four wheelers, carts, etc.) to accomplish the work described in the Statement of Work; e.g. excess property pick up, furniture installation/reconfiguration, moving activities, special event activities, furniture cleaning, furniture repair, specialized moving activities and special handling moving activities.
While a contract for these services was awarded in September, 2009, it was determined that the estimated scope of work was not accurately reflected in the schedule of work.  This "re-compete" effort reflects the revised scope of work.  The current contract will be "Terminated for Convenience" of the Government upon award of the new contract.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A detailed description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  All technical submittals should be organized as directed in Section L.
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with Time-and-Material pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  It is anticipated that the base period of the new contract will run from April 1, 2010 to September 31, 2010, with option years available on a fiscal year basis for the following four years.    
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO AND SOW MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 16, 2010 FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, February 25, 2010.  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Technical and cost proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, February 25, 2010.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.

<DESC>AMENDED TO UPDATE EXPECTED RFP ISSUANCE DATE&nbsp;AS MARCH 5, 2010.<br /><br />AMENDED TO INCLUDE NOTICE THAT THERE WILL BE A PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE FOR THIS EFFORT. ANTICIPATED DATE IS MARCH 18, 2010&nbsp;AND LOCATION TBD.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>A full and open competition is anticipated with a request for proposals expected to be issued <strong>APPROXIMATELY</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EARLY MARCH</strong>, 2010&nbsp;with proposals due approximately 30 days later.</p>

<DESC>This is Amendment No.01 issued to Solicitation No.WC133M-10-RP-0049 which is an attachment to the posted synopsis. The closing date is extended from March 2, 2010 to March 10, 2010. Closing time remains at 1:00PM central time. Offerors will need to acknowledge receipt of amendment 01 in their proposal. The following contractor questions and Government responses are provided.
<p>1.Which operators require stereo capability? What are the signal types that need the stereo capability (receivers, radios, and intercom)?</p>
<p><strong>RES: All stations would benefit from stereo capability, however, at a minimum, key flight station locations (Pilot, Copilot, and Navigator) require the stereo capability. Note: this response adds to and changes the specification Statement of Work. All contractors proposed ACS system shall be required to provide stereo capability at the pilot, co-pilot, and navigator locations, at a minimum. </strong></p>
<p>2. Please provide the pricing validity requirements or the anticipated contract award date for items 0001 and 0002.</p>
<p>RES: If this is asking when we would like to award this or how long the quote should be valid; award should be made by the last week of April therefore the quote should be valid for 60 days.</p>
<p>3. In the Statement of Work, Figure 1 of Section 1 shows four (4) Flight Crew Station Control boxes, whereas Table 1 of Section 2.1 shows six (6) positions with Radio Transmit capability. Should we assume there are 6 "Full Capability" and 15 "Limited Capability" control stations?</p>
<p>RES: Yes, there shall be at least 6 "Full capability" control boxes. "Reduced capability Crew Station Control boxes are identified above for cost savings or system simplification purposes only. If the proposed system does not benefit from utilizing reduced capability interface boxes, then only full capability boxes should be proposed."</p>
<p><br />4. Other than the Final Design Review, Preliminary and Final Reports listed in item 0001, and the Maintenance and Repair manuals/documentation listed in item 0007, are there any additional data items required? Are there CDRL format requirements?</p>
<p>RES: No, there are no specified additional data items required. The format of the CDRL requirements is not specified. This acquisition is for a complete Audio Control System, including "all electronic components, connectors, software, systems, and documentation necessary for system integration and full operation including a block diagram of major components and their interconnections." The submitted proposals will be evaluated for completeness and details necessary to meet the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria.</p>
<p>5. Item 0002 identifies delivery of a "Complete Audio Control System" less nine identified control boxes. Please explain this partial system requirement and why the Government has identified the remaining control boxes separately in line item 0003. As these types of systems generally require different configuration software for different compliment of control boxes, this sequential delivery may add cost.</p>
<p>RES: The partial system requirement is intended to allow acquisition of a partial system in the event sufficient funding for the entire system is not immediately available. This partial system as per Item 0002 allows for a minimum capability system which still meets minimum requirements for performance of a limited number of scientific missions. As per the statement of work, the configuration software tools and required documentation are to be included as part of the proposed system.</p>
<p>6. Is the switch between headset and speaker external or internal to <br />ACS system?</p>
<p>RES: Per the statement of work, "Capability to switch Pilot, Copilot, <br />Navigator and Aft Galley audio to a local speaker is required", and it<br />is identified as a desired capability for all other crew stations. <br />NOAA is open to various implementation methods as proposed by vendors. <br />The system currently installed on our P-3 aircraft has this feature <br />implemented via a switch on the audio control box.</p>
<p>7. Is the binaural audio with programmable azimuth a requirement for <br />Directional affect for audio inputs (spatial affect)?</p>
<p>RES: Per the statement of work, "Stereo headset capability, and <br />Software configurable to route the various audio sources to the left, <br />right, or both headset speakers shall be provided." This is a minimum <br />capability which assists the user in prioritizing audio traffic. <br />Advancing this capability further to effectively provide programmable <br />Azimuth capability is an advanced capability beyond the minimum <br />requirements, and is identified in the statement of work as a desired <br />feature.</p>
<p>8. Can two reduced capability crew stations share the same audio or <br />should they be independent?</p>
<p>RES: "Dual station reduced capability Crew Station Control boxes are <br />identified above for cost savings or system simplification purposes <br />only." Independent audio is an advanced capability over shared audio, <br />but either is open for consideration for stations with side by side <br />positions. The vendor may identify various optional features such as <br />this separately to assist NOAA in selecting the best, cost effective <br />solution.</p>
<p>9. How many recorder outputs are required?</p>
<p>RES: A minimum of one output.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No further contractor questions will be responded to by the Government unless they are mere clarifications of the existing solicitation and amendment 01. Contractors will need to make their business decisions based on the solicitation and amendment 01. Offerors will need to acknowledge receipt of amendment 01 in their proposal.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda. The U.S. Embassy Kampala requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics. 

The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about March 05, 2010. No paper copies will be mailed.

A site visit is expected to be scheduled on one of the following dates: March 15, 16, 22, or 23, 2010 at the U.S. Embassy and their facilities in Kampala. A firm date for the site visit will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Kampala. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit.

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Larry A. Pruitt Jr at PruittLA@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857, UNITED STATES

Description

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start, through the Program Support Center (PSC), has a requirement to procure State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, to the maximum extent practicable, improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that meet or exceed the standards described in section 641 (A)(a)(1) of the Head Start Act, within the following areas:

	School readiness
	Training/career development needs of staff
	Correction of deficiencies

The Office of Head Start is seeking the procurement of up to 52 State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will secure services of at least one Early Childhood Education specialist in every state of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico who possess demonstrable and credible experience in the field of early childhood education. Specific expertise is sought from offerors providing training and technical assistance strategies that positively impact the developmental and educational outcomes for children birth to five. 

Each state will include at least one early childhood education (ECE) specialist, with the number of ECE specialists increased in accord with the number of grantees and delegates within a state. The work of these specialists will be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff. In each state one ECE specialist shall function as the Center Manager. 

The Early Childhood Education (ECE) specialist position requires a degree and qualifications in Early Childhood Education/Development at the bachelors degree level with masters degree preferred and a minimum of five years experience in programs for young children. In states with only one ECE specialist, the degree and experience for that specialist must be inclusive of both birth to three and three to five year old development and  learning. This experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and education managers.  For states staffed by more than one ECE specialist, the education and experience of one specialist may be specific to children from birth to three; the education and experience of the second specialist may be specific to children from three to five. For states staffed by more than one specialist, it is also recommended that each specialist have experience and/or education with the implementation of effective strategies for working with unique special populations of children. 

In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of at least one Grantee Specialist for each of the ten ACF Regions. These specialists will be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. In regions with few grantees with identified deficiencies, the grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or with grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Program Information Report (PIR). In order to facilitate and support close communication between these grantee specialists and the regional office, these specialists will be employed by the TTA Center in the State where the regional office is located. 

These states are as follows:

	Region I  Massachusetts
	Region II  New York
	Region II  Philadelphia
	Region IV  Georgia
	Region V  Illinois
	Region VI  Texas
	Region VII  Missouri
	Region VIII  Colorado
	Region IX  California
	Region X - Washington

The Grantee Specialist position requires a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (BA or BS) Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; and experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees. Both positions, the Early Childhood Specialist and the Grantee Specialist, require a significant background in the use of reliable data collection systems that track measurable outcomes for children and programs.

Finally, there will be one TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist for each of the ten regions. (See above.) As is true with the grantee specialists, this individual will be employed by the state Center in which the regional office is located. The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist will work with regional office staff to coordinate the work of the State TTA Centers within that region. 

The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist requires a BA or BS Degreewith a preference for a Masters degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees.

The number of Early Childhood Education Specialists, Grantee Specialists, and TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialists depend upon the number of grantees and delegates per state.  Attachment 1 provides the estimated level of effort in each state.

Offerors may propose staff that lives near, but not in, the state for which the capability statement is being written. However, it is required that all individuals have some relationships established with the early education community in that state.

To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof.  

In states  where less than three Early Childhood Education Specialists are to be proposed (see Section 3.1.1 (b)  Contraints  Staffing Based on Size of Head Start Programs by State),  offerors are encouraged to propose a consortium of two or more states situated within that ACF Region in order to maximize resources. Consortium proposals are subject to the Regional restrictions below:

Region 1:  No consortium shall include Maine or Rhode Island but any other combination of Region 1 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 2:  No consortium shall include Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands but any other combination of Region 2 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 3:  No consortium shall include Delaware, Pennsylvania, or Washington, D.C., but any other combination of Region 3 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 4:  No consortium shall include Mississippi or South Carolina nor a combination of Tennessee and Kentucky but any other combination of Region 4 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 5:  Any combination of Region 5 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 6:  No consortium shall include Arkansas or New Mexico but any other combination of Region 6 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 7:  No consortium shall include Iowa but any other combination of Region 7 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 8:  No consortium shall include North Dakota or South Dakota nor a combination of Montana with Colorado or Utah but any other combination of Region 8 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged.
 
Region 9:  No consortium shall include any states in Region 9.
 
Region 10:  No consortium shall include Alaska but any other combination of Region 10 states in a consortium is permitted and encouraged. 

It is anticipated that up to 52 cost-reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for a 60-month period.  Responses to the Request for Proposal package will be due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP.  Award of this requirement is anticipated by July 31, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the PSC. 

For further information, contact Erica Binnix in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<DESC>This is an amendment of the notice posted on 02/16/2010.  The purpose of this amendment is to make available the statement of work applicable to this A&E effort.  The statement of work follows:
R/V STICKLEBACK STATEMENT OF WORK
I.	GENERAL INFORMATION
A.	Introduction.  This SOW concerns the architectural design of refitting and the actual refit of the R/V STICKLEBACK, a former US Coast Guard Patrol/Rescue boat, as a Fisheries Research Vessel capable of trawling, gillnetting, overboard instrument sampling and hydroacoustic sampling.  This design will be used to bid the project to contractors for the actual refit.B.	Background.  STICKLEBACK, formerly USCG 41309, was acquired in 2002 from the US Coast Guard.  Deck equipment has already been installed, including a trawl net reel, roller, winches, gallows, gillnet lifter, instrument winch and sorting table.  The existing Cummins 903 engines, designed for speed, are fuel inefficient and are at the end of their service life.  They are also very large, making installation of hydraulic system and ship's service electrical system impossible in the engine compartment.  These engines should be replaced with smaller, more fuel efficient engines that will leave space in the engine compartment for the hydraulic system and a ship's service electrical generator.  Stability calculations will also need to be done to ensure proper stability with the new mechanical equipment.C.	Definitions:  i.	Hydraulic System: Hydraulics package, including pump, reservoir, piping, etc, to power the installed fishing equipment, driven by either an electrical motor or PTO from generator.ii.	PTO: Power Take Off - Method of driving hydraulic pump by mechanical connection to an engine.iii.	Ship's Service Electrical System: Provides 120VAC electricity for hydraulics, various equipment, lights, computers, etc. 
II.	WORK REQUIREMENTS
A.	Technical Requirements - In consultation with LSBS personnel the contractor will develop an acceptable/appropriate architectural design that will include the following:B.	Determine type/brand/model engines to be installedI.	Design facilitation of installationII.	Determine hydraulic system to be installedIII.	Determine generator to be installedIV.	Design facilitation of installation of hydraulics and generatorV.	Design lake water wash down system with sufficient flow and pressure to be determined with consultation with LSBS personnelVI.	Design navigation lights to show Restricted ManeuverabilityVII.	Design canopy system for deck fish processing areaVIII.	Design hoist system for A frameIX.	Design a sonar tube deployment system for hydro-acoustic and searchlight sonar equipmentX.	Calculate stability dataXI.	Arrange for and provide for installation of all itemsC.	Performance Goals (requirements):I.	Transit cruising speed of 18-20 knotsII.	Trawling speed to be determined with consultation between LSBS personnel and ship architect/marine engineerIII.	Electrical Capacity to drive hydraulics, ship's service including ROV (120V 650-1000W), 3 personal computers, refrigerator, microwave, other small appliancesD.	DeliverablesI.	A comprehensive design package that will be presented for bid by refit contractorsII.	Delivery date: TBD
III.	SUPPORTING INFORMATION
A.	Place of Performance: Contractor's Choice. STICKLEBACK is located at the Washburn, WI Marina and is available for inspection.  The Marina requires a $1,000,000 insurance bond if work is done on their premises.  If the contractor opts to do the work elsewhere, the contractor is responsible for transporting STICKLEBACK to that location and back to Washburn.

This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This announcement is open to businesses regardless of size. Contract Award Procedure: If a large business firm is selected for this announcement it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are: (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned SDVOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB.

The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />b.

<a href="mailto:donald.marsh2@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.The Solicitation states that, "A/E firms must be located within a 100 mile radius of at least one of the facilities in VISN 1 listed above and be fully A/E qualified and licensed in those States to be considered". Can a firm be fully qualified in one or more of the states but be in the process of becoming fully A/E qualified in other states with the anticipation that such licensing would need to be secured prior to signing any contracts for work?Yes, a firm must be licensed in at least one of the states in the VISN and they will still be able to do work for a Federal Facility.  This seems to contradict in my interpretation "Full and open competition will be utilized. The NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue."  Are we disqualified for consideration for this presoliciation?This presolicitation is open to all size firms and is just asking for SF330's.  Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.  However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.  Both Part 19 and Section F do overlap with some of the information, while some is different.  It is up to the firms to determine how to address this section.  There is room for flexibility here, as long as this part is answered.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Do you have to qualify as a small business to submit? This is open to any size firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.We are preparing a submittal for the above referenced solicitation.  We are a Civil Engineering and Landscape Architectural firm.  Are submittals being accepted for just these disciplines or do the submittals have to include ALL disciplines?The presolicitation lists the possible disciplines that the VA may require during the period of the AE IDIQ contract.  Firms are to best address the criteria for this that is listed in the presolicitation.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

If so, who holds them?The Contracting Offices at each of the medical centers in VISN 2 may have their own AE IDIQ's, but the National Energy Business Center does not currently have their own.Can the engineering firm act in a prime capacity on this project? ( The RFQ references A/E)The Prime firm can be either under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested?

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Does each proposed sub consultant need to be an SBE, or is it just the prime consultant?Firms of any size are encouraged to submit as the prime under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.  It does not matter what size or status the subs have.  The rankings will not be affected by the subs.Do we need to submit a complete SF 330 for each subconsultant?The VA will evaluate the SF330's that are received and the necessary information from the sub consultants.This seems to contradict in my interpretation "Full and open competition will be utilized.

The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Do you have to qualify as a small business to submit? This is open to any size firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.We are preparing a submittal for the above referenced solicitation.  We are a Civil Engineering and Landscape Architectural firm.  Are submittals being accepted for just these disciplines or do the submittals have to include ALL disciplines?The presolicitation lists the possible disciplines that the VA may require during the period of the AE IDIQ contract.  Firms are to best address the criteria for this that is listed in the presolicitation.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.The VISN 4 A/E IDIQ # VA-776-10-RP-0118 solicitation states that: Firms must also be fully A/E qualified and licensed in at least one of the states in the VISN to be considered.If the firm itself is not registered within the state but has architectural and engineering staff that are licensed within the state (i.e., Professional Engineers & Registered Architects), is that acceptable for meeting this requirement?The firm must be licensed in the state the VISN is located in.  This seems to contradict in my interpretation "Full and open competition will be utilized. The NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue."  Are we disqualified for consideration for this presoliciation?This presolicitation is open to all size firms and is just asking for SF330's.  Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.  However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.  Both Part 19 and Section F do overlap with some of the information, while some is different.  It is up to the firms to determine how to address this section.  There is room for flexibility here, as long as this part is answered.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Can you clarify for me what "Pre Solicitation" means?  Will there be another RFP for this project?  If a firm does not submit a pre solicitation proposal, will that exclude them?This presolicitation is asking for interested firms to submit their SF330 statement of qualifications.  This is the first part for the FAR 36.6 and Brooks procedures for the procurement of Architect and Engineering Services.  An RFP will only be submitted to the highest ranked firm.  A firm will not be considered if they do not submit their SF330 package.What are the subcontracting goals in evaluating any responses?  This presolicitation does not have any specific subcontracting goals. With regard to facilities design, do these also include Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration and National Cemeteries Administration? Facilities design includes what was listed in the presolicitation, but does it could also include the VHA, VBA, and NCA.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Do you maintain a list of SDVOSB firms who have performed successfully for VISN 6?We do not maintain or have a list of SDVOSB firms who have performed work at VISN 6.Will our HUBZone status provide any advantage to us?This AE IDIQ presolicitation is open to all size and category of firms.  The only two that may have considerations are SDVOSB and VOSB firms.  Unfortunately HubZone will not have any advantage.Will an awardee be precluded from bidding any projects that develop as a result of any IDIQ studies, evaluations, investigations, etc.?The awardee will be precluded from bidding on any of the projects that they designed.The Solicitation states that, "A/E firms must be located within a 100 mile radius of at least one of the facilities in VISN 1 listed above and be fully A/E qualified and licensed in those States to be considered". Can a firm be fully qualified in one or more of the states but be in the process of becoming fully A/E qualified in other states with the anticipation that such licensing would need to be secured prior to signing any contracts for work?Yes, a firm must be licensed in at least one of the states in the VISN and they will still be able to do work for a Federal Facility.  This seems to contradict in my interpretation "Full and open competition will be utilized. The NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue."

Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Will all of these projects under this IDIQ be Energy related projects? Are you looking for a submittal from a comprehensive team able to handle any and all of the different services listed including the specialty energy services, i.e., geothermal, co-generation, bio-mass, solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, utility metering, retro-commissioning, LEED-EB, renewable energy, energy efficiency, etc.?As of right now, this IDIQ is focusing on Energy projects, and we are looking for a comprehensive team to cover what is listed in the presolicitation.  However, within the next day or so there will be a modification to the presolicitation posted on FBO. 7) MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES: Address experiences from the projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330 in regards to: (1) CADD and other computer applications; (2) value engineering; (3) life cycle cost analyses; (4) environmental; (5) historic preservation; (6) energy conservation; (7) new energy resources; and (8) Critical Path Management (CPM) and fast track construction. I have seen other posted questions regarding Part 19 (from other V/A Solicitations) that suggest that the solicitation might instead have intended to list Part 20, that is, the Section F featured projects, as opposed to the projects on the Team resumes (part 19).  It may be less efficient to reference the projects on the Team resumes as opposed to the Section F projects.  It has seemed that more in-depth information is readily available for the showcased projects.This section was left broad, as to interpretation by the firms.  This is open to how each firm wants to interpret it as long as it answers what is being asked for in the presolicitationWith regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Do the responding firms have to hold registrations in each of the three states that make up the VISN-7 area (AL, GA, SC) or just for the state of the VISN-7 office location that they are within 100 miles of?The responding firms need to be registered in at least one of the states in the VISN, in which the firms office is within the 100 mile radius.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.  However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.  Both Part 19 and Section F do overlap with some of the information, while some is different.  It is up to the firms to determine how to address this section.  There is room for flexibility here, as long as this part is answered.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.

Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested?

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Do you have to qualify as a small business to submit? This is open to any size firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.My question is whether the 100 road-mile radius limitation will be enforced literally or generally.  More specifically, are Knoxville firms restricted from competition despite their obvious proximity to numerous VISN 9 locations?The 100 mile radius limitation was set up to provide a general cut off point.  When submitting please include the exact amount of miles away the firm is from the closest primary VA medical facility.We are preparing a submittal for the above referenced solicitation.  We are a Civil Engineering and Landscape Architectural firm.  Are submittals being accepted for just these disciplines or do the submittals have to include ALL disciplines?The presolicitation lists the possible disciplines that the VA may require during the period of the AE IDIQ contract.  Firms are to best address the criteria for this that is listed in the presolicitation.We are preparing our submittal for VA-776-10-RP-0123 and were wondering if we are limited to five projects for section 19. We typically use 10, so we wanted to confirm before we send in the documentation. Thanks for your help.Ten is acceptable.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Would you like to see a SEPARATE (and signed) Section H for each sub-consultant or ONE Section H signed by the prime firm that has information from the prime and ALL the sub-consultants?This decision is up to each firm, as it was left open.  Whatever way best represents Part H for the team.Does the 100-mile radius restriction apply to the prime submitting firm only, or would we qualify if one of our subconsultants (ie civil engineer, landscape architect, etc.) had an office within 100 miles of one of the VISN 10 facilities?The 100 mile radius applies for the prime firm.  We are submitting on this project and wanted to know we have a Civil SDVOSB that we are currently working on a VA project with.  We are located in Dayton Ohio, but the Civil Engineer is located in Georgia.  Does the SDVOSB need to be the lead in order to be considered?The SDVOSB has to be the lead firm with the 100 mile radius to be considered to the SDVOSB language that is listed in the presolicitation.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Is the above referenced pre-solicitation intended for large, single source A/E firms or predefined teams? In other words, will a small business that performs some, but not all, of the services listed be considered or do we need to team with other disciplines for the proposal?  Please advise.This presolicitation asking for AE firms to submit SF330's is for any size business.  Any firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS code can submit, and fill out a team of subcontractors to meet the criteria and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  This is not just for a large firm that can do everything in house.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.  However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.  Both Part 19 and Section F do overlap with some of the information, while some is different.  It is up to the firms to determine how to address this section.  There is room for flexibility here, as long as this part is answered.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in VISN 12 in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Regarding the referenced solicitation, please clarify whether submissions are limited to ten (10) projects in Part F of the SF330.The presolicitation is asking for 10 projects to be listed in Part F of the SF330, but it is up to the firm whether or not to submit more.A question regarding the IDIQ project- are you selecting A/E's for each site or for all the sites in one? The VA NEBC is selecting A/E's for each VISN, not each facility in the VISN.  The locations are wide spread, but as long as the prime firm is within 100 miles of one of the primary medical center facilities in the VISN, they are eligible.Are consultants to the prime required to be within 100 miles of one of the primary medical center facilities in the VISN?Only the prime must be within the 100 mile radius.Are we required to include all 'possible' disciplines at this time as outlined in the description, or should we only include MEP/FP Engineering?  The disciplines listed in the solicitation include Structural, Civil, Landscape, Geotechnical, Surveying/Mapping, Hazardous Materials / Environmental Services, NEPA, Historic Preservation, Cost Estimation? The presolicitation listed all the possible disciplines that could be involved with this AE IDIQ, and firms are to create their teams accordingly.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.We are doing a joint venture for the above project with an MPE firm and need to know if each firm can submit 10 projects in SF 330 Section F or is it limited to 10 projects for the entire team?That is up to the firms.Regarding the subject Presolictation notice posted on Fed Biz Opps, does the VA intend to issue a formal RFP for these requirements?The presolicitation is the only part that will be posted on FBO, as the VA is following the FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering and Brooks Act procedures for this procurement. The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.Will Joint Ventures be considered for past performance on the SF 330? If so, what guidelines or regulations will be followed to recognize the Joint Venture? Also, Can the partnering Joint Venture Non-SDVOSB firm that possesses the professional licenses qualify the Joint Venture team for licenses requirements?  What percentage of work has to be performed by a SDVOSB to still qualify or remain eligible as a SDVOSB lead team?A joint venture may be considered a service-disabled veteran owned small business concern if--     (1) At least one member of the joint venture is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, and makes the following representations: That it is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, and that it is a small business concern under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement;     (2) Each other concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement; and     (3) The joint venture meets the requirements of paragraph 7 of the explanation of Affiliates in 19.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.     (4) The joint venture meets the requirements of 13 CFR 125.15(b).   (e) Any service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern (non-manufacturer) must meet the requirements in 19.102(f) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to receive a benefit under this program.Also, FAR 19.502 discusses the percentage of work an SDVOSB must do.What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.When we submit our qualifications for this contract, are we to provide SF 330's for consultants? Firms are to provide as much information on their teams as possible including the SF330 information.  If we are to provide information for our consultants, do we need to list one for each trade?How firms make up their teams to meet the criteria and disciplines listed in the presolicitation is up to them.  Since all projects will stand alone and each project will be different, do you expect a list of consultants to cover the energy projects, landscape, geo-technical, surveying/mapping, hazardous materials/environmental service, etc? We would expect those trades will be hired as needed.The SF330 that is submitted should address the team that the firm will be using for all of the potential disciplines and projects listed in the presolicitation.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.The list of VISN 16 facilities in Solicitation Number VA-776-10-RP-0128 does not include the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, AR.  Was it intentionally left off the list or should it also me included?The Fayetteville, Arkansas VA Medical Center is included as one of the primary medical facilities located in FVISN 16.  This was unintentionally left off the list. We are an engineering firm and would like to submit, I was wondering if we needed to submit with a Architectural Firm or should we submit just for the Engineering?This presolicitation is asking for firms under the 541310 Architectural Services, or 541330 Engineering Services NAICS Codes to submit their SF330 Statement of Qualifications.  The criteria listed in the presolicitation must be addressed, which includes having an architect, as there are both construction and energy projects listed in the presolicitation, as possible design projects.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.The solicitation states "A/E firms must be located within a 100 mile radius of at least one of the facilities in VISN 16 listed above and be fully A/E qualified and licensed in those States to be considered".  Does the State licensure requirement apply only to those facilities located within 100 miles of the prime firm, or all locations of facilities in VISN 16 listed in this solicitation?The state license requirement applies for the prime that is located within the 100 miles of at least one of the facilities, and it also applies for all of the locations in VISN 16.  If a firm is licensed and registered in at least one of the states in the VISN, then that will allow them to perform work in any of those states in that VISN.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Is Houston included in the "VISN 17 Outpatient Clinics and Vet Centers in VISN 17"? The Houston VAMC and Outpatient Clinics/ Vet Centers are located within VISN 16, not VISN 17 as referenced in this email.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Questions 5, 6, and 7 of SF330-Part H (Additional Information) refer to relevant projects that were listed in SF330 Part 19 - Relevant Projects listed under the Individual Resumes.  However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.

Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Do you have to qualify as a small business to submit? This is open to any size firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.We are preparing a submittal for the above referenced solicitation.  We are a Civil Engineering and Landscape Architectural firm.  Are submittals being accepted for just these disciplines or do the submittals have to include ALL disciplines?The presolicitation lists the possible disciplines that the VA may require during the period of the AE IDIQ contract.  Firms are to best address the criteria for this that is listed in the presolicitation.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.We would like to submit our qualifications for this solicitation, but our office located 105 miles away from the major VA facility in Big Spring and 120 miles away from the facility in Amarillo.  There is a VA Outpatient Clinic located here in Lubbock but the solicitation excludes those facilities when it refers to the distances traveled.  Does the five miles over disqualify us from submitting on this solicitation? Make sure to include the exact distance from the closest VA facility.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.Are you intending to offer just one contract for all of the VISNs?  Or one contract for each separate geographic location? There is at least one contract that will be awarded for each VISN, with the possibility of multiple awards.  So there will be at least one contract awarded for this presolicitation number you have notes, which is for VISN 19.The additional information being requested for Part H, specifically numbers 5, 6 & 7, refer to projects listed in Part 19.  To what is that referring?  The only 19 that I can see is the list of projects on each individuals resume, which will be a different list for each person so that would not give a consistent reply to numbers 5, 6 & 7.  Clarification would be greatly appreciated.For 5,6, and 7, these have been addressed in a previous Q and A amendment posted on FBO on 2/1/2010, but will be addressed again as well. Part 19 has the potential to overlap with the projects listed in Section F, but not necessarily in all cases.  This section is left open to the firms to best answer questions 5,6, and 7 from the information from Part 19 and/or section F.  A representative sampling between what is in Part 19 and Section F would be appropriate.Although we are outside the 100-mile requirement, we are frequently on-site there, and are interested in submitting for this IDIQ.  Would our distance preclude us from submitting on this IDIQ?  The presolicitation states the 100 mile radius.  If the distance is questionable, make sure it is noted in the SF330 if submitted.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?

However, SF330-Section F list Example Projects which best illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications?  These Projects do not have to be the same.  Would you please clarify; for questions 5, 6, and 7, are you wanting the additional information of the Individual Resume Projects in Part 19 (as currently stated), or the Team's Projects displayed in Section F?This presolicitation is asking for question 5,6, and 7 to be addressed through part 19.  Both Part 19 and Section F do overlap with some of the information, while some is different.  It is up to the firms to determine how to address this section.  There is room for flexibility here, as long as this part is answered.Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.  If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.  By no means do we expect all fifty projects to be addressed.Do you have to qualify as a small business to submit? This is open to any size firm under the 541310 or 541330 NAICS Codes.We are preparing a submittal for the above referenced solicitation.  We are a Civil Engineering and Landscape Architectural firm.  Are submittals being accepted for just these disciplines or do the submittals have to include ALL disciplines?The presolicitation lists the possible disciplines that the VA may require during the period of the AE IDIQ contract.  Firms are to best address the criteria for this that is listed in the presolicitation.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.The RFP does not address this issue, whether the firm that is awarded this contract would be excluded in bidding for the construction of any resulting VA energy projects?The firm or firms that awarded an AE IDIQ contract, will not be able to bid on the construction projects that they designed.I'm looking at Section H, questions 5, 6 and 7 and I believe the projects we should be referring to would be in Section F rather than Part 19.  Is that correct?The presolicitation does read that we are asking for Part 19.  In some ways Section F and Part 19 overlap.  This is up to the firms to decide how they best want to answer this.  Do we send electronic versions for each one via email and no hard copies?  Also, in the past, for SF-330 submittals, I have submitted a SF-330 for each of our subconsultants in their own section, which was widely accepted.  Is this acceptable with your agency too?Please send electronic copies via email to Donald.marsh2@va.gov.  It is acceptable and up to each firm whether or not they would like to submit a SF330 for each sub.Is this IDIQ limited to just firms that can provide all of the services listed in the solicitation?  Will an engineering firm that can provide a subset of the services requested be considered also, or must they team up with a firm that can provide the architectural services also?The VA is looking for firms to provide the services and disciplines that are listed in the presolicitation.  How firms achieve this is up to them.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal? The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.  Multiple emails are acceptable, if labeled 1 of 2, etc.  	If the firm submits as a sub consultant on one team does that pre-clued them from acting as prime?A firm can only submit as a prime once, but firms can be sub-consultants for multiple teams.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.  Firms are to put projects that best demonstrate what is listed in the presolicitation.  The section F portion of the SF 330 allows the VA to view what projects a firm has performed on.Can a non-architect/engineer owned SDVOSB firm submit to provide A/E services using consultants as the professionals to provide the A/E services as long as the SDVOSB has engineering services listed on their CCR registration? The criteria in the presolicitation must be met to be considered for this AE IDIQ contract.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.As this is an IDIQ "Presolicitation" and no specific requirement is defined, does the VA expect the respondent to complete Part I and Part II or just Part II and Section H of Part I?The VA expects the respondents to complete both Part I and Part II of the SF330.What does "fully licensed and qualified A/E firms" mean?  We have credentialed and licensed people, per se.  Please clarifyFully licensed and qualified refers to firms being licensed in the state(s) they are performing the work in.  In this case, firms must be registered in at least one of the states that the VISN is located in.If we are unable to team with a multiple disciplinary team, would it be appropriate for us to submit as a single discipline under the category of Landscape Architect?In the presolicitation for VISN 22, the VA listed the disciplines that would be needed to be addressed by interested firms and their teams.  This AE IDIQ is looking for a variety of disciplines that could come up for possible energy projects.  So that we can provide more applicable and specific references, can you tell me the types of engineering and architectural projects?  Structural?  Concrete?  Geo?The potential project types are listed in the presolicitation.Could you clarify what you mean by "Management Plan"?The VA is looking for how the Management of the firm will handle each of the phases mentioned in this section.  This is left open for the interpretation of each firm to address this in the manner they feel will fit best.The Pre-solicitation notice states that "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firm." Will companies receive a preference if they utilize a SDVOSB company as a subcontractor under this procurement?This is only available for the prime firms.Does the VA require the A/E to be able to evaluate building energy use and provide an EPA Energy Star energy performance rating? This will be on a per task order basis depending on the project type.What is the design goal energy performance rating for renovations and additions to VA buildings?The goals will be on a per task order basis depending on the type of project.For estimating effectiveness (point #5 in section H), breaking out percentage change orders for major divisions is difficult and often misleading.  Most changes affect more than one discipline and multiple subcontractors, making it difficult to track on large projects.  Can we list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative to describe any special situations?Yes, you can list the total percent of change orders and provide narrative for special situations.  What percent or anticipated percentage of work will be allocated to the different disciplines requested? (eg. Architecture, MEP, Structural, Civil)A percentage for each discipline has not been set.We recognize this to be a pre-solicitation notice.  Is it the intent for this to also serve as the combined synopsis / solicitation for this particular offering? This presolicitation is asking for SF330's which is the main part of the FA36.6 and Brooks Act process for Architect and Engineering Services.  After receipt of the SF330's we will be evaluation using Brooks Act and FAR 36.6 AE Services procedures.  So the answer to your question is this serves as the only posted form of a solicitation, as the actual solicitation only is given to the highest rated firm or firms after evaluations and interviews have been held.Are there specific initiatives and/or goals for the VA in the area of bio-mass renewable energy?This was included in the criteria of the presolicitation as one of the many potential energy projects that may be needed over the course of these AE IDIQ contracts.With regards to section F how would you be ranking this section would more weight be given to VA projects, Retro-Commissioning Projects, or Governmental work?  The reason we ask the question is that we have preformed considerable amount of work in each category and we want to demonstrate the projects that you are looking for.The projects that were listed in this email, are similar to what is listed in the presolicitation.

If the interested firm meets the NAICS code, and the other criteria then it will be evaluated.  Also reference FAR 52.219-14 regarding subcontractors of SDVOSB firms.  These three items request a considerable amount of information for projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, which are the Relevant Projects that are listed in Section E, Resumes.  Are you sure this what you want? We estimate a minimum of 25 resumes. Each resume has ~5 projects. Many are duplicates, but there could easily be over 50 projects. Did you mean to provide the information for the projects in Section F, which are limited to 10?A list of questions and answers for this presolicitation was posted on 2/1/2010, and this question was one of them on there.  The response basically suggested a representative sampling from the resumes will work, as long as it best illustrates what the firm and its team members have done in terms of items 5, 6, and 7.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the latest modified presolicitation posted on 2/3/2010 for the requirements.The solicitation number on page 1 of 4 is "VA-776-10-RP-0135". On page 4 of 4, instructions state that the subject line must show "VISN 23 A/E Services #VA-776-10-RP-0134". Should we be using 0134 or 0135?This should be -0135 throughout.  The 0134 was a typo that will be corrected in the next presolicitation posted.Do you anticipate hiring one (or more) firm(s) to serve a specific facility?  Or do you plan to hire one (or more) firm(s) for all facilities?  Can you explain the structure in which the contract(s) will be awarded?  The VA is looking to award at least one IDIQ contract to an AE firm for all the facilities in VISN 23.  Firms are to build a team that can best meet the criteria listed in the presolicitation.We need to provide surveying/mapping services.  It would seem to make sense to use a surveyor/mapper in proximity of each facility rather than a single one in Minneapolis, for example.  If this is a reasonable approach, do we need to identify nine surveyors/mappers?It is up to the firms how to address the needs of each discipline listed in the presolicitation.  This would make for a rather large team, but it is entirely the firms decision.  There are some disciplines listed that are more vital to most projects than others.Can each one of our team members submit 10 project examples in Section F, or is our team limited to a total of 10 project examples?The team is to submit ten projects that they have been a part of in section F.  It is the firms decision if more projects are to be added there. What is the maximum file size limit that the VA email system can accept from outside senders?  Would you accept multiple emails 1 of 2 , 2 of 2 etc for the same submittal?The limit is around 6 MB that we can accept.

Recovery Act Project #2004190: Enhanced Geothermal Systems Technology Research and Development. Project #20685, Agreement #18829-Enhanced Geothermal Systems with CO2 as Heat Transmission Fluid - Idaho National Laboratory will conduct experiments for evaluating the effect of supercritical carbon dioxide, at elevated temperatures, on precipitation and dissolution of mineral phases that are typical of geomedia found in geothermal reservoirs.
Project #20685: A Physics-Based Fracture Stimulation Reservoir Flow and Heat Transport Simulator - Idaho National Laboratory will develop a physics-based rock deformation and fracture propagation simulator by coupling a discrete element model for fracture generation with acontinuum-based multiphase fluid flow and heat transport model.
Project #20685, Agreement #19969-Air CooledCondensers in Next-Generation Conversion Systems, Idaho National Laboratory will identify and resolve issues that are associated with using air-cooled condensers in the next-generation energy conversion systems, achieve the full benefits of using mixed working fluids in air cooled binary cycles, evaluate the benefits of using air-cooled condensers with flash steam cycles, and establish criteria for designing air-cooled binary plant turbines.
Project #20685, Agreement #19968-Advancing Reactive Tracer Methods for Measuring Thermal Evolution in CO2 and Water-based Geothermal Reservoirs - Idaho National Laboratory will develop a set of tracer test planning and analysis tools to define the parameters necessary for successful testing, identify new tracers suitable to a wide range of potential reservoir volumes and permeabilities, and demonstrate the utility of newly developed tracers in a system representative of Enhanced Geothermal Systems.

<ARCHDATE>03122010
<DESC>DS/OFM/IM has identified the Zebra Card Printer model P520i as the primary production printer for identification documents created by DS/OFM.  The security laminate is a required component that prevents the unauthorized duplication of identification documents produced from this office.  The laminate contains an indelible, holographic image of the Department of State's seal, which is impervious to modification once heat-laminated to teh surface of the PVS identification card.  This security device is recognized by law enforcement agencies throughout the U.S. and its territories and also registered with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). DS/OFM only has less then one month of laminate supply for production of identification documents currently available.  An interruption in supply will prevent OFM from issuing identification documents thereby endangering the public and members of the foreign diplomatic community and their dependants accredited to the United States and its terroritories.

This action falls under FAR part 6.302-2 as this procurement is needed urgently to fill a need for additional laminates as there is less then a month supply remaining to continue operations for the Office of Foreign Missions which may be harmed if production must stop due to lack of these laminates which are vital in supporting the nation's foreign diplomatic community.

Attached is the J&A for synopsis as required under FAR 5.2.  This notice is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Covance Research Products, Inc., Denver, PA on a sole source basis for husbandry, veterinary and breeding services of 230-250 Government Owned Indian Origin Rhesus Macaques NHP.  This is for the continuation of a current ongoing service contract. Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in loss of animals and disruption of research projects already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.
