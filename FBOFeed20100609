<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) <br />Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Tech Source, Inc., of Altamonte Springs, FL. <br /><br />1. SCOPE OF WORK. The contractor shall provide all personnel, tools, equipment, facilities, transportation, supervision, and other items and services necessary to develop and deliver, and to integrate the software required under the Performance Work Statement.<br /><br />1.1 Background. The Rehost application is approximately 250,000 lines of C language software that runs on the Solaris UNIX operating system. Within the application there are approximately 20 logical components that were at one time labeled computer software configuration items (CSCIs). A Rehost backend CPU will typically have over 40 Rehost processes running concurrently and interacting via inter-process communication. There are typically two radar data acquisition CPU processors for redundancy, two backend CPU processors for redundancy, a dual Ethernet for redundancy, and a single Graphical Display Processor (GDP) workstation for each controller position.<br />The Rehost application capabilities can be described at the highest level as the GDP, the Central Mode Controller (CMC, storing state and including radar message processing, RMP), the On-Line Database (OLDB), the Multiple Model Tracker (MMT), and the Radar Multiplexer (RMUX). Radar data is received at the RMUX, is projected into the system plane by the RMP, is tracked by the MMT, and is sent for display at the GDP. Flight Plans and other commands are entered at the GDP, executed at the CMC and OLDB, and distributed back to all GDPs.<br />The Rehost application uses third party COTS software with Northrop Grumman modifications for the video card display drivers, and for the RMUX radar data acquisition across serial communication interfaces. The Rehost application contains a proprietary generic database and a GUI for site adaptation management. The Rehost application runs on Solaris 2.6 through Solaris 10 operating systems, on the Sun SPARC and on the Intel x86 hardware platforms. The code has been ported to the Linux and AIX operating systems.
<p>1.2 Software Development. <br />1.2.1 Rehost Adaptation. The contractor shall provide software to implement functionality of their hardware within the Rehost environment.<br />1.2.2 Touchscreen Functionality. The contractor shall provide software to successfully integrate the functionality of the Tech Source 2K x 2K IR Touchscreen device (Light Touch) with the Rehost application. <br />1.2.3 Blended Windows. The contractor shall provide software to successfully integrate blended windows display functionality with the Rehost application.<br /><br />Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. In addition, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e., Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR Part 12. Anticipated Award date is 18 JUNE 2010. Responses should be submitted via: e-mail: <a href="mailto:albert.yeh@edwards.af.mil">albert.yeh@edwards.af.mil</a> or by faxing, Fax #: 661-277-0470 (please call and verify that I have received the fax). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is 100% set aside for service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) firms.  The Atlanta VA Medical Center (VAMC) located at 1670 Clairmont Road, Decatur, GA anticipates the award of a firm fixed price contract to provide design/build services for a complete design and construction services contract to complete project number 508-335, New Parking Deck Addition.  This project is for a multi-level parking deck comprised of two three level parking structures providing a total of approximately 500 parking stalls.  A minimum of 3% of the parking stall will be accessible as defined by the latest edition of the ADAAG standards and architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard.  The two parking structures will be connected at ground level by a common drive area and main stair/elevator tower.  It is likely that future parking needs of the Atlanta VAMC will require additional parking.  Therefore, these structures will be engineered for future expansion of three levels, for a total of six levels of parking in each structure.  The design/build team shall provide all services necessary to provide investigative & testing services, contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, construction period services, site visits, equipment and supervision to design and construct the new parking structure.  The project shall consist of constructing two three-level parking decks at the Atlanta VAMC.  This structure is planned for construction on top of the existing valet parking lot.  The new parking structure will provide approximately 500 new parking stalls.  The project will include demolition of the existing valet parking lot, major earthwork for footers/support columns, new concrete floors on top of encased steel beams, new lighting, fire standpipe system, new storm drain and site work.  The project will be designed to achieve energy consumption level that is at least 30% below the level achieved under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, if life cycle cost effective.  Use appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 to document energy savings.  The contractor will be required to work after normal business hours to minimize disruptions.  The design/build project will be completed within 455 calendar days from the date of receipt of the Notice to Proceed.  The estimated cost of this project is between $5 million and $10 million with a NAICS code of 236220 and a small business size standard of $33.5 million.  Evaluation Criteria:  Proposals will be evaluated and award will be made on the basis of both technical considerations and cost most advantageous to the Government.  Evaluation factors are construction management, past performance, schedule and cost.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and may award a firm fixed price contract without discussions.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on/about Monday, June 28, 2010 on the Federal Business Opportunity website (www.FedBizOpps.gov); hard copies of the solicitation will not be available.  Contractors must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR, www.ccr.gov) and VetBizOpps (www.vip.vetbiz.gov) to be eligible for award.

<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,  Columbia Cascades Area Office, Yakima Field Office, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Central Washington University  to provide technical and other services to assist Reclamation with the enhancement of two old access roads allowing Reclamation contractor's access to management units adjacent to Wenas Creek to restore vegetation to near native conditions. In 2010 CWU will prioritize and conduct cultural resource investigations of the proposed road sites before investigating other areas. CWU will complete the road site investigation and will prepare a survey/inventory report acceptable by standards established by the Washington Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation. Task two includes having CWU complete the southwest side, right bank, investigation of Reclamation's Wenas property and will prepare a survey/inventory report acceptable by standards established by the Washington Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation.
The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is  implemented by FAR 6.302- 1;  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (i) Supplies or services may be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that --(A) Demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see definition at 2.101), or, demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the particular research services proposed;The cited authority must be used because only the proposed contractor possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition: 
Reclamation's Wenas Creek properties are located northeast of Selah Washington where Wenas Creek enters the Yakima River. The Bureau of Reclamation purchased 429 acres on both side of Wenas Creek in two separate acquisitions, see attached maps. Historically, this area has had significant use by Native Americans. Reclamation identifies the need to protect these cultural resources and wants to establish a sole source contract with Central Washington University, CWU, to provide faculty and student staff to conduct a cultural resource investigation on Reclamation's Wenas properties. This activity is part of CWU's field school program that provides students with archeological field experience. The sole source justification is based on:"	Past work history, CWU has been conducting cultural resource investigations on the Wenas properties since 2005."	Yakama Nation is aware of the previous work performed by CWU on the property and has not expressed any objections."	The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business June 18, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attn.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has a requirement to develop a series of at least six online Communities of Practice (COP) to leverage the use of educational technology to improve teaching, assessment, learning, and infrastructure in schools.  COPs are designed to assist people in learning about and understanding best practices, research, and implementation strategies by learning from experts and from each other.  COPs can become very scalable and sustainable by utilizing well developed online community technology platforms and designing for high quality content distribution, meaningful interactions, and access to expertise.  The online communities to be developed under this contract will be measured by the quality and quantity of content, interactions, and exchanges.  They will scaffold best practices by providing the information and ongoing support for improving learning with technology, ensuring teachers are highly effective and connected to data, resources, content and expertise and providing assistance for the best modern infrastructure build out for 24/7 community wide learning.<br />
<p>The online COPs developed under this contract will be designed to implement recommendations in ED's new draft National Educational Technology Plan (NETP).  The NETP (see http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/index.html) discusses topics such as learning sciences, universal design for learning, cloud computing, eRate and broadband infrastructure.  It discusses devices for students and the policy and privacy implications of data.  It suggests new ways of thinking about online materials and the need for interoperability standards.  ED initiated the development of the new NETP to capitalize on the opportunities created by technological advancements and new research on learning that has emerged since the publication of the last NETP in 2004.  ED's goal was to create a vision for the strategic application of technology throughout the education system in support of student learning and achievement and consistent with the Administration's broader educational and economic priorities.  Dissemination of the new NETP goals and recommendations is critical to ensure effective and comprehensive implementation by State Educational Agencies (SEAs) and Local Educational Agencies (LEAs).</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this contract will be thirty continuous months, with an option for six additional months should ED decide to design, develop, and launch two (2) additional online COPs.  The Government intends to award a contract using an unrestricted full and open competition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  ED will make an award to the Contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation, has no deficiencies (as defined in FAR 15.001), and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, price will be a substantial factor in source selection; however, quality factors (including technical merit) are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>ED anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about June 25, 2010.</p>

This is a new addition or new contract to expand the existing HP server infrastructure. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs. The Mobile Computing ARRA funded project is designing, building, and deploying a remote access system (currently called GO, Global OpenNet) for global use by Department employees and contractors. GO is architected 10 support 5,000 concurrent users. The GO infrastructure will reside in ESOC east and will leverage the IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure provides virtual servers to host customer systems, allowing the ESOC to consolidate customer systems from stand-alone servers into an efficient, highly available, centrally managed infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure also provides virtual servers used internally to host the ESOC infrastructure services (e.g. Active Directory. DHCP, backup, availability monitoring, configuration management). HP servers have long served as the ESOC core infrastructure. The purchase  to support the GO infrastructure is an extension of the existing infrastructure and is required to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer lights-out ESOCs.41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirement as a key component of the Department's IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. This purchase is an extension of the investment already made in this brand name. This is not a completely new installation but builds upon existing infrastructure. Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully. The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation ofContract NNG06EA009C with the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) Lunar ExplorationNeutron Detector (LEND) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission. CSC is currently performing LEND safety and health oversight for the LEND Instrument,including engineering parameter review and trending, as well as participating in thescience operations which includes initiating all commands to the Instrument, planning allInstrument modes and turn-ons.	NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to CSC.  Theestimated period of performance of this firm-fixed price (FFP) contract extension will befor twenty-five (25) months from February16, 2011 through March 15, 2013.  CSC is theonly organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for thefollowing reasons:  1) Only CSC and the other current partners in the LEND investigationpossess the high level scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the LENDInstrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to carry out the calibration andoperations in a combined manner in which the scientific operations and the flightoperations can be merged.  2) CSC personnel, in particular LEND Co-Investigator Dr. LarryEvans, are unique in their familiarity with the LEND Instrument design, testing andcalibration as well as the LRO spacecraft.  From 2005-2009, CSC was a key part of theteam which designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the LEND Instrumentfor the LRO spacecraft, including at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO.  Undercontract NNG06EA09C, CSC has successfully carried out the science operations of the LENDInstrument on the LRO spacecraft since LRO launch in June 2009.  Dr. Igor Mitrofanov ofRussias Institute for Space Research, as a leading expert in his field of planetary andspace physics, was selected by NASA to lead this investigation, based on an evaluation ofhis proposal submitted under the Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurementsin NASAs LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O). This proposal, which proposed LEND as acontributed Instrument supplied by the Russian Federal Space Agency, identified Dr. LarryEvans of CSC as a Co-Investigator to ensure LENDs scientific and operational success. Asignificant factor in the selection was the particular characteristics of the LENDInstrument that Mitrofanov and Evans proposed, which was judged superior to itscompetitors at the time.  The LEND Instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kindInstrument.  In addition, CSC developed software for: testing the Instrument on-orbit andmodeling Instrument performance, checking telemetry received for health and safety of theInstrument, and producing summary data.  This effort requires the detailed understandingof the Instrument and all related software.  Since CSC made unique contributions to eachof these areas described above, no other organization not currently part of the LENDinvestigation has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement.  3) CSCscientists have helped lead the effort in the community to analyze the data products fromthe LEND Instrument, and current LEND team members are the only organization with thecapability to carry out the combined scientific and Instrument operations.    Statutory authority for this firm-fixed price procurement is 10 U.S.C. 304(c)(1)--OnlyOne Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide theseservices without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work,should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication ofthis synopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 23, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be consideredby the agency.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NIH has a requirement in support of a program that will require provision for medicinal chemistry services. The NINDS envisions awarding a contract for medicinal chemistry services as part of a new Medicinal Chemistry for Neurotherapeutics Program (MCNP), which is designed to help overcome barriers to drug development for diseases that affect the nervous system. The MCNP is part of an overall NIH Blueprint Network program initiative.<br /><br />The design of the MCNP is to provide neuroscientists with medicinal chemistry services to develop preclinical drug candidates-optimized drug leads that are ready for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The MCNP will involve the following components, which will interact as follows:<br />&bull; A medicinal chemistry facility (Contractor). The Contractor will provide compound design, synthesis, and management services, as well as in vitro pharmacology and toxicology assays for the purposes of improving the drug-like qualities of compounds.<br />&bull; Neuroscience researchers (Contributors) with bioactive small molecule compounds and bioactivity assays. The Contributors' compounds will serve as starting points for medicinal chemistry. The Contributors, using their own bioactivity assays, will test compounds provided by the medicinal chemistry Contractor. <br />&bull; NIH staff. The NIH Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) will oversee the medicinal chemistry contract. The COTR will offer suggestions and provide feedback to the Contractor on medicinal chemistry strategies and project design, in consultation with the Contributors and NIH-hired medicinal chemistry consultants (see below). <br />&bull; Information Technology (IT) system. The NIH will establish a database and user-friendly interface for entering, searching, downloading, and visualizing medicinal chemistry data. The medicinal chemistry Contractor and Contributors will be responsible for entering the data that they generate into this database. All MCNP participants will receive training on how to use the IT system and technical support.
<p>The MCNP will serve as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network and provide medicinal chemistry for drug development projects independent of the Blueprint Network. The Blueprint Network offers neuroscience researchers access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise, including medicinal chemistry, IND - enabling studies, and phase I clinical trial infrastructure. A goal of the Blueprint Network is to advance compounds successfully from chemical optimization through phase I clinical testing, at which point the compounds will be more attractive for private sector investment and commercial development. <br />Preclinical drug candidates generated from these projects will undergo further development and testing through other NIH programs or within the academic or commercial sector.</p>
<p>The work of the Contractor will be divided into projects. In general, each project will involve a different Contributor. Projects will include any or all of the following stages: (1) Exploratory Chemistry, (2) Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, and (3) Lead Optimization. The goal of Exploratory Chemistry is to gather sufficient data to determine whether the starting compound(s) and primary bioactivity assay provided by the Contributor are suitable for pursuing Hit-to-Lead Chemistry. Exploratory Chemistry will generally include obtaining commercially available compounds that are structurally similar to the starting compound(s) ("SAR by catalog") and limited chemical synthesis of custom-designed analogs. The goal of Hit-to-Lead Chemistry is to develop one or more chemical series that demonstrate a mature SAR, successful outcomes in preliminary absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) assays, IC50/EC50 &lt; 100 nM in the primary bioactivity assay (potency in a cellular assay is desirable) and, if the Contributor has in vivo models, in vivo activity. For Lead Optimization, the goal is to develop a preclinical drug candidate with optimized ADME properties and minimal predicted toxicity. The Contractor must have sufficient capacity to support a workload comparable to any of the following combinations of projects: (1) 6 projects in Lead Optimization, concurrently; (2) 10 projects in Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, concurrently; and (3) 3 projects in Lead Optimization and 5 projects in Hit-to-Lead Chemistry, concurrently.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following services during the contract: (1) project planning; (2) project management; (3) design, procurement, and milligram-scale synthesis of chemical analogs; (4) multi-gram and scale-up synthesis for testing in animal models; (5) in vitro pharmacology and toxicology testing for lead optimization; (6) compound registration and data entry; and (7) compound management.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the Blueprint program and of individual medicinal chemistry projects is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the NIH has received approval for a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) and deviation to the standard FAR Clauses associated with patent rights and rights-in-data. The FAR clause deviations will be made a part of any resultant contract, and will allow Contributors to retain control of the intellectual property for compounds tested, evaluated and/or created through the MCNP.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement completion type contract with line item options, will be made from this solicitation and that award may be made on or about April 15, 2011, and will cover a five-year period of performance. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP). Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-10-01 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis. THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY. OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THE FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED. NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford in order to assist the EPA to conduct in-house research expanding the suite of environmental impact assessment models to include sustainable water use for biofuels.  Recent US biofuel standards have mandated that more of the future gasoline and diesel be manufactured from biobased feedstocks.  This work supports the efforts of the STD to provide recommendations concerning the sustainability of water use related to increased biobased feedstock production.
Related in-house research in the area of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) in the past has lead to the development of the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI) which allows quantification of various impact categories such as: ozone depletion, global climate change, acidification, eutrophication, smog formation, human health cancer, noncancer, criteria pollutants, ecotoxicity, and fossil fuel depletion.  
The in-house research of expanding the suite of environmental impact assessment models to include sustainable water use for biofuels will be supported by this work which will apply a probabilistic analysis to guide a scientifically based simplification to existing water yield/use/scarcity models found within InVEST and will assist in a demonstration of the impact assessment of water use for increased biofuels production based on scenarios developed by the EPA.
A case application using InVEST will quantify the impacts of water yield/use/scarcity based on changing water use over the entire nation to determine the impacts of additional biofeedstock production over various time scenarios. The scenarios for analysis will be developed by the EPA.  A probabilistic analysis using InVEST will identify the most sensitive input parameters to the water analysis models to allow future scientifically defensible simplification of the models and increased ease of use.  

The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620.  The size standard for this code is $7 million.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to Garry A. Plear, Contract Specialist, at the office identified above, by e-mail plear.garry@epa.gov.   The technical documentation must establish that the instrument to be provided meets all requirements.  Anticipated award date will be in July 2010.  Documentation must be submitted to Garry A. Plear by 3:00 PM, June 23, 2010 in order to be considered by EPA.  
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Garry A. Plear, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2054, or via e-mail at plear.garry@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to Mr. Garry A.

<DESC>Military communications networks exist in order to support information flow up to higher headquarters and command direction down to the executing units. As the executing units (both afloat and on ground) have become more dispersed, the networks have become more complex due to the variety of communication technologies required to enable both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications including intra- and inter-unit. It is assumed that network(s) will never be fully connected (fragmented) at any one point in time. In order to assist the Navy and Marine Corps in addressing their communications network issues, ONR Codes 30 and 31 invest in science and technology initiatives that will provide for future reductions in human maintenance of networking capabilities.

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for efforts that develop and demonstrate technologies addressing selected network communications issues. These are considered to be supporting technologies required to enable improvements throughout the communications realms of interest. 

This effort will develop S&T technologies and products that significantly enhance tactical edge communications networks. Solutions are to be delivered at a technology readiness level (TRL) suitable for transition to acquisition Programs of Record (nominally requiring a TRL of 6). Prior to transition to PORs, the technology and products developed here will first be evaluated via a fleet-led government-coordinated experimentation process. The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that are sufficiently robust to provide to the warfighter. Potential PORs include, but are not limited to, the Navy Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) Future Capabilities, USMC Marine Air-Ground Task Force C24ISR, USMC Warfighter Information Network-Expeditionary (WIN-X) and US Army CERDEC, US Army Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), JTRS and AFRL-related programs.

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct an Industry Day on Friday, June 25, 2010 at Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20375. 
Building 222 Auditorium. No Foreign Nationals are permitted. Check-in will begin at 8:00 AM Eastern Time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a purchase order to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for the follow-on study and data gathering to provide a means of calibrating an erosion law for the Hawaiian Islands.  The USGS Ridge-to-Reef project operates two experimental sites to monitor rainfall, runoff and attendant erosion on the island of Moloka'i.  The sites generate data to forecast sediment pollution to the reef on the south side of Moloka'i.  Research grade repeat ground-based LiDAR allows the Ridge-to-Reef project to assess the exact magnitude of yearly lowering and to use the information together with sensors data to calibrate an erosion model.  University of Hawaii, Manoa, Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, has previously accomplished this research using their research-grade ground based unit, which is the only known unit in the Hawaiian Islands.
Duration of the follow-on purchase order period: Date of Award through 12/31/2010.  No solicitation documents will be issued. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.  NAICS:  611310.  Anticipated award date:  On or about June 24, 2010.  Point of Contact:  J. Stevenson, Contracting Officer (916) 278-9344, jstevenson@usgs.gov

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. <br /><br />The Air Force's (AF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC), Wright-Patterson AFB, is issuing a sources sought synopsis to determine if there are businesses qualified and capable of supplying and installing light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway lighting fixtures at AF bases. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 335129 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The CECC is seeking a Capability Package from all qualified contractors. Responses should include information identifying whether the interested firm is a small or large business. <br /><br />The ESG CECC was established as part of the AF's Installation Acquisition Transformation (IAT) with a goal to strategically source civil engineering commodities enterprise-wide. The CECC's taxiway lighting spiral will convert all existing AF airfield taxiway quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The CECC is determining the optimal sourcing strategy to handle the purchase of LED taxiway lighting fixtures as well as the subsequent installation on the airfield. The CECC intends to identify companies with the capability to install taxiway fixtures at bases within a specified region(s). See attachment for a breakdown of bases that are located within identified regions and the associated number of fixtures. It is anticipated that the contractor must handle projects at multiple bases, sometimes simultaneously, within the awarded region. Interested companies are asked to highlight which region/regions they intend to cover in their response.<br /><br />At a summary level, the anticipated scope for the LED taxiway lighting acquisition includes:<br /><br />&bull; Remove elevated and in-pavement taxiway edge light fixtures.<br />&bull; Furnish and install new elevated (L-861T) and in-pavement (L-852) light-emitting diode taxiway fixtures.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;Fixtures must be Federal Aviation Administration approved, in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular 150/5345-46C.<br />&bull; Fixtures may be installed in the continental United States (CONUS) on over 40 AF bases in varying quantities per base.<br />&bull; The period of performance for the project at each base is estimated to be 90 days.<br /><br />The Government anticipates the contractor will provide all personnel, materials, equipment, and services necessary to perform the tasks outlined above. The contractor must be able to obtain the adequate security clearance to perform the work on-base.<br /><br />Responses are due no later than 5 PM EST 30 June 2010. Your submittal should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages. If late information is received, it may be considered by the Government Evaluation Team, depending on agency time constraints. Responses should be submitted by email to the following:<br /><br />Mr. Chris Muntz<br />email: christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil<br /><br />IMPORTANT: This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future, or represent the amount of work anticipated.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is interested in determining the state of the art/ practice of readily available barrel technologies that reduce overall barrel weight.

The purpose of conducting this survey as part of a research effort is to identify potential sources of different types of readily available barrel making technologies that will reduce overall barrel weight while maintaining the required muzzle velocities and design safety factors associated with existing barrels.  The overarching objective of this research effort is to ascertain 1) the viability short term (less than one year) implementation of readily available light weight barrel technologies for low rate of fire weapon systems such as bolt action sniper rifles and 2) quantify and characterize limitations and tradeoffs associated with light weight barrel technologies.  In addition, the government seeks to characterize tradeoffs associated with system performance such as accuracy and dispersion, heat dissipation, erosion, barrel harmonics, and recoil.  Potential lightweight barrel candidates shall meet the following criteria:
1)	Readiness Level:  Design is ready to work in its final form and under expected conditions and the manufacturer currently has the required tooling/machinery to fabricate and deliver small sample quantities within 60 days after contract award for Government evaluation.  The manufacturers existing technical data currently provides sufficient data to support fabrication of prototype materiel (Developmental Design Drawings) and production processes are mature enough to reliably fabricate samples for evaluation.  (See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawing definitions).

2)	Technology/Technical Approach:  Weight reduction that is accomplished solely by removing steel from a barrel (e.g. fluting, tapering) does not apply to this source sought announcement.  The Government is interested in the use of alternative barrel materials and/or processes to include, but not limited to, carbon fiber wrapped or low density alloy composite barrels and/or new manufacturing methods that enable the use of alternative barrel alloys to reduce weight and maintain or improve barrel stiffness.

3)	Caliber:  Chambered to accommodate a .300 Winchester Magnum caliber cartridge.

4)	Interface:  Must be fabricated in a way to interface with a Remington 700 action.

5)	Length:  The technology and processes must be such that fabrication of barrels from 22 to 28 inches is achievable.

6)	Muzzle Break Interface:  The technology, design, and process must be such that external threads can be machined near the crown of the barrel to accommodate commercially available muzzle break/sound suppressor assemblies.

7)	High Pressure Resistance:  All barrels should be able to safety accommodate high pressure events which will be validated by firing proof rounds that conform to ANSI/SAAMI 2299.4 
This survey will provide insight to the government on lightweight barrel technologies that are readily available for immediate employment by the Government for evaluation.  Request interested firms provide details of their product as relates to the detailed information above, along with associated pricing information.  Also request the questionnaire below be addressed.  All submissions shall be limited to 15 pages.

Vendor Questionnaire:  Configurable Extended Range Sniper Rifle.  The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information from industry to assist in the market research.  Government encourages all interested vendors to submit any comments that they might have.  
1.	Company Name 
2.	Company Address 
3.	Company point of contact and phone number 
4.	The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 332994.  With small business size standard of 500 employees. Based on this information is your business considered a small business? 5.	Commerciality: 
a.	( ) Our product as described above, has been sold leased or licensed to the general pubic
b.	( ) Our product as described above, has been sold in substantial quantities, on a competitive basis to multiple state and local government. The development of the product was done exclusively at private expense
c.	( ) None of the above applies. Explain. 
6.	Location where primary work will be performed (if more than one location, please indicate the percentage for each location).
7.	Major partners or suppliers.
8.	Identify existing facilities, equipment and workforce (identify what percentage would be supporting this new effort and what additional resources would be required).
9.	Please provide any additional comments.

Any and all information should be mailed,at no cost or obligation to the government, within 15 days of this announcement to :  US Army Contracting Command,  Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, ATTN: John Hynes, Contract Specialist, Building 9, CCJM-SW, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or email: john.hynes1@us.army.mil .

<DESC><p>Synopsis:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is seeking industry solutions regarding the capacity, availability, methodology and interest of industry sources for procuring and implementing secure electronic voting services both for remote and on-site elections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Request for Information (RFI) is for industry comments only and is not a Request for Proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Government will not pay for any information provided in response to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NLRB is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer and enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or "the Act"), which is the primary Federal statute governing labor relations in the private sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the law is to serve the public interest by reducing interruptions in commerce caused by conflict between employers and employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seeks to do this by providing orderly processes for protecting and implementing the rights of employees and regulating the respective relationships between employees, their unions, and employers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Act contains a statement of employees' bill of rights, which establishes freedom of association for purposes of participating in the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the Act, the NLRB has two primary functions: (1) to conduct secret-ballot elections among employees to determine whether they wish to be represented by a union; and (2) to prevent and remedy statutorily defined unfair labor practices by employers and unions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The five members of the National Labor Relations Board ("the Board"), as well as the General Counsel, are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board and the General Counsel maintain a headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the agency also maintains a network of Regional or "Field" offices, each of which is under the direction of a Regional Director.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The complete organizational structure and additional information on the NLRB may be found at the NLRB's internet web site at (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/">http://www.nlrb.gov</a></span>).</p>
<p>All NLRB proceedings originate from the filing of charges or petitions by employees, labor unions, and private employers who are engaged in interstate commerce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About 26,000 cases are received by the Board through its Regional, Sub-regional, and Resident Offices each year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRB received 3,400 petitions in representation cases and conducted 2,085 elections in fiscal year 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approximately 150 of these elections were conducted through the use of mail ballots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the remainder of the elections, employees cast manual ballots in portable voting booths at designated sites, typically employer facilities.</p>
<p>Information Sought:<br />The NLRB's requirements are for the acquisition of electronic voting services to support conducting secret-ballot elections to determine representation issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the Agency requires a proven solution that supports mail, telephone, web-based and/or on-site electronic voting; that includes the necessary safeguards to ensure the accuracy, secrecy, observability, transparency, integrity, accountability, and auditability of Agency-conducted elections; and that has demonstrated experience in protecting similar type elections from both deliberate misconduct and simple error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to electronic voting capabilities, the Agency specifically requests information, to the extent available, relating to what safeguards, if any, could be implemented to ensure that votes cast remotely were free from distractions or other interferences, including undue intimidation or coercion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Agency also requests, to the extent available, information relating to experience regarding the level of participation achieved through remote electronic voting technology (vs. traditional on-site elections, whether manual or electronic).</p>
<p>The combination of the NLRB's continuing technological modernization, the numerous locations and size of offices, and varying end-user competency levels may add complexity to the electronic voting services solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the NLRB decides to proceed, it plans to award a fixed price or fixed unit price contract with a base year and four option year terms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At present, the NLRB does not possess the necessary information to estimate the size of the award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is noted that the NLRB prefers to execute pilot programs prior to full implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sources having the capability and/or concept solutions to meet the requirements above are invited to respond to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any proprietary concepts or other information should be identified as such.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Submitted data and information will not be returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRB is requesting interested vendors to submit their contact information and any information providing solutions for procuring electronic voting services as described in this synopsis by close of the RFI to Doug Wolf at <a href="mailto:doug.wolf@nlrb.gov">doug.wolf@nlrb.gov</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /><br /></span></p>

<p><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Medical Directorate is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking a third party logistics (3PL) provider to initially manage, receive, stow, maintain inventory records, storage, packaging, transportation, shipment documentation, shipment tracking data and reporting of the Pandemic Influenza products Probenecid and Rimantadine. The scope of the requirement is not limited to the two identified products as other pharmaceutical products may later be identified and added to any resultant contract.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia is examining the potential for a third party logistics provider to receive/store/distribute pandemic influenza products for the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical Directorate on behalf of the Department of Defense Health Affairs Pandemic Influenza Program. The vendor is required to provide receipt, warehousing, inventory management, packaging, and transportation of the pharmaceutical products Probenecid and Rimantadine. In addition, upon Government direction the 3PL supplier shall prepare shipment documentation, packaging, and shipping via traceable means said products to customer activities throughout CONUS (Contiguous United States) plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico under FOB Destination procedures. The requirement is for 25,000 bottles of Probenecid (bottles of 100); which is estimated to be 10 pallets (2592 bottles per pallet, 864 bottles per pallet layer) and 50,000 bottles of Rimantadine (bottles of 100); which is estimated to be 7 pallets (7920 bottles per pallet, 660 bottles per pallet layer). Estimated dollar value of products is approximately $7 million. Estimated shelf-life of products upon receipt is 20 to 36 months. The products shall be warehoused under Controlled Room Temperature of 68 degree Fahrenheit to 77 degrees Fahrenheit with excursions between 59 and 86 degree Fahrenheit.

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Medical Directorate is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking a third party logistics (3PL) provider to initially manage, receive, stow, maintain inventory records, storage, packaging, transportation, shipment documentation, shipment tracking data and reporting of the Pandemic Influenza products Probenecid and Rimantadine. The scope of the requirement is not limited to the two identified products as other pharmaceutical products may later be identified and added to any resultant contract.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia is examining the potential for a third party logistics provider to receive/store/distribute pandemic influenza products for the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical Directorate on behalf of the Department of Defense Health Affairs Pandemic Influenza Program. The vendor is required to provide receipt, warehousing, inventory management, packaging, and transportation of the pharmaceutical products Probenecid and Rimantadine. In addition, upon Government direction the 3PL supplier shall prepare shipment documentation, packaging, and shipping via traceable means said products to customer activities throughout CONUS (Contiguous United States) plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico under FOB Destination procedures. The requirement is for 25,000 bottles of Probenecid (bottles of 100); which is estimated to be 10 pallets (2592 bottles per pallet, 864 bottles per pallet layer) and 50,000 bottles of Rimantadine (bottles of 100); which is estimated to be 7 pallets (7920 bottles per pallet, 660 bottles per pallet layer). Estimated dollar value of products is approximately $7 million. Estimated shelf-life of products upon receipt is 20 to 36 months. The products shall be warehoused under Controlled Room Temperature of 68 degree Fahrenheit to 77 degrees Fahrenheit with excursions between 59 and 86 degree Fahrenheit. All material shall be warehoused in accordance and in compliance with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 1079, "Good Storage and Shipping Practices" and Chapter 1118, "Monitoring Devices - Time Temperature, and Humidity". The 3PL facility must be approved to handle Controlled Room Temperatures in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and meet all FDA regulatory requirements to warehousing pharmaceuticals. The goal of this initiative is to have a supply of these pharmaceutical products readily available for shipment/transportation in the event of an influenza pandemic or other public health emergency. Upon notification 3PL suppliers would be expected to have product shipped within 24 hours and delivered within 48 hours to CONUS activities plus Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Anticipated Scope of Services:</p>
<p>Warehousing - The ability to receive, store and manage these pharmaceutical products in a secure, controlled room temperature environment while maintaining shelf-life requirements. Inventory accountability will be at the unit of sale level; which is "Bottle".</p>
<p>Receiving - Acknowledging receipt of inventory from manufacturers. Validating and reporting inventory quantities received. Handling any associated discrepancies in receiving said products from incorrect quantities, shelf-life issues, and damaged material.</p>
<p>Distribution - Packaging, labeling and transporting the products to the end user to include providing traceable shipment tracking data to Government point of contact and entering said data into Government web supplier order management system. Prepare shipment documentation to include shipping labels. Ensure that shortest dated material is shipped out first. All outbound shipment quantities will be at the "bottle" level count; for example: 10 bottles, 1 bottle, 24 bottles, etc.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT<BR><BR>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A BRAND NAME CONTRACT using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 to procure:   Installation of smart meters and connection to existing Siemens brand DDC system for the Washington Air National Guard, 254 RHF, Camp Murray, Tacoma, WA. The Govt intends to award a brand name contract for above product to SIEMENS.<BR><BR>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD BRAND NAME TO SEIMENS using the simplified acquisition procedures. Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  In this project, we will be installing Smart Meters to identified buildings and connecting to existing Siemens brand DDC system. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, equipment, and materials required to provide and install utility monitoring devices to all buildings on base. <BR><BR>Part of the system is the Direct Digital Control (DDC) system that controls and monitors the HVAC units.  The DDC system consists of electronic devices that attach to various points on the HVAC system, and a central control panel.  These components then interface with the Installation DDC Infrastructure that is already established to run all of the facilities for the Western WA ANG.  This established backbone is a Siemens brand system.  The components that are currently in place are Siemens components.  The individual components must be able to interface and communicate with the existing Siemens backbone system.  <BR>The services associated with the assembly, installation or servicing of equipment are of a highly technical or specialized nature. Item possesses a unique function or capability critical in the use of the item and not available from any other sources. The Washington Air National Guard (WA ANG) is currently utilizing Siemens Digital Energy Monitors (DEMs) to monitor electrical consumption at ten different facilities. The meters will be all tied together through the Siemens APOGEE building automation system. Leveraging the existing hardware and software system infrastructure located at each of the WA ANG buildings is the most cost effective utility monitoring solution available. Thus in order to expand on the current level of utility monitoring WA ANG will need the assistance of company to achieve its Federal mandated metering goals.<BR><BR>Reason for sole source, the company has always programmed all our DDC system in Camp Murray utilizing their parts and is providing annual training for our individuals to be proficient and current in operating process for the system. In current GSA contract Siemens will provide following service: Start-up, checkout, programming and owner acceptance of the DDC controls associated with this project. Siemens will provide and install 1 2-DI point module for the existing RBC DDC controller, Sage natural gas meter, Onicon water meter and Digital Energy Monitor (DEM 2000). Control and interlock wiring for the installation of water and natural gas meters. Conduit will be used in mechanical rooms and exposed areas.<BR><BR>Modifications to the existing Siemens Insight graphics to include the new DDC points. Provide and install FLN `communication connection from the PXC Modular DDC controller to the DEM 2000. The statement of work is for alterations to the existing Direct Digital Control system. When dealing with Direct Digital Controls (DDC), there are many components of the system that must work together. When upgrading existing equipment, Siemens tend to only address one group of components at a time. Throughout this process they must maintain the ability for each piece of equipment to communicate with the remaining parts. This equipment is vendor specific and can only be procured by one source in this geographic zone. The existing system at the Western WA ANG is Siemens; therefore in order to uphold the compatibility with the existing system no other control contractor can make the required changes to the system. Only Siemens can purchase and install Siemens-type products. Additionally, they hold the sole proprietary rights to any hardware and software upgrades needed to maintain or extend the system. <BR>The services specified require a trained and certified technician specifically on the Siemens DDC System. All Siemens personnel have completed the required certification. The local Siemens branch office has also customized all the program logic for the Western WA ANG Siemens DDC System. System diagnostics and system performance adjustments should be performed by Siemens to assure the Systems integrity is maintained.<BR><BR>There are components from other manufacturers that the Siemens infrastructure can monitor, however, only Siemens products are able to be controlled by the operating system that resides in the BCE section.  From our terminal, we can turn on, turn off, and adjust all the HVAC systems for the base.  This gives us the ability to immediately troubleshoot and adjust HVAC units in case there are problems.  Other products would require a third party interface to translate information, and a separate computer program to run just that one building.  We had this arrangement in one of our buildings at one time and had to replace it because it did not work.  Siemens technicians periodically come down and perform maintenance on the code in the program, and this is where much of the conflict comes in with other components.<BR>As this is a replacement of one small part of an overall system that has been in place for numerous years, this is not a new requirement.  Any future component replacements of the DDC system would need to also be Siemens products.<BR><BR>*******<BR>All sources sought inquiries/response received within 8 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement. For specific questions, please email Heidi R. Weber, Contract Specialist, heidi.weber@us.af.mil.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement not later than 9:00 AM PST, 17 June 2010. <BR><BR>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA  92835.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research at Penn State require titanium rotor packages for use with the Optima L-90K Ultra.  The rotor packages will be used in the ultracentrifuge system to conduct large-volume cell and protein separations.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research possess an Optima L-90K Ultra manufactured by Beckman Coulter.  The Optima L-90K is an ultracentrifuge with specific size fittings and weight requirements for the internal rotor.  Other ultra centrifuge manufacturers have similar rotor requirements to be able to use in their ultracentrifuge. Beckman Coulter has not licensed their rotors for the Optima L-90K Ultra to other manufacturers.  OEM titanium rotors are the only compatible rotors for the Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K Ultra. <BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A search was conducted between 8 April and 14 April 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search.  The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and keywords, Titanium Rotor, Ultracentrifuge, Lab Equipment, and Biotech Equipment.  The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned several small businesses associated with both the NAICS 334516 and any of the relevant keywords.  None of the found vendors could offer the required items.<BR><BR>Internet research found that the models that best meet the salient characteristics of the titanium rotor package are available from the manufacturer Beckman Coulter. While several ultracentrifuge rotor models are available on the market, they are not compatible with the Optima L-90K Ultra.  The titanium rotor packages manufactured by Beckman Coulter best meet the requirements.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   None<BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  <BR><BR>The titanium rotors requested are manufactured specifically for use in the Optima L-90K Ultra.  The specific size fittings and weight requirements are proprietary to Beckman Coulter and can only provide suitable parts for their equipment.  <BR><BR>6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice Number: NIH-NICHD-BPCA-RFI-2010-12
Announcement Type: Special Notice
Key Dates
Release Date: 
Response Date:  
Issued by
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) (http://www.nichd.nih.gov) 
Background
The Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology Branch (OPPB) within The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is involved with the planning and implementation of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) 2007 (http://bpca.nichd.nih.gov/ ).  The BPCA 2007 authorizes the NICHD, in consultation with the U.S. FDA and experts in pediatric research, to identify therapeutic gaps in pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions in which more complete knowledge of treatment strategies, including drugs and biologics, may be beneficial to the pediatric population.  The lack of adequate pediatric formulations has been identified as a major obstacle for the study and use of drugs in children. 
While concern has been focused on the medicinal component of the drug formulations administered, the history of drug toxicity in children has several examples of pediatric tragedies that have their origins in the excipients employed rather than the drugs used in the formulation preparation.
 In 2006 NICHD created the United States Pediatric Formulations Initiative (US PFI) to address safety issues and problems associated with the lack of adequate pediatric Formulations (Clin. Ther .2008;30 (11) 2097-2101). A similar Pediatric Formulation Initiative was created in 2008 in the European Union. (EU PFI).
The  US and EU-PFIs  are working together  to examine the risks of excipients in pediatrics and to, identify gaps in safety information, and ultimately create and maintain a pediatric  excipients database that is available to drug  sponsors, scientists and the public.
For this purpose a joint EU-US PFIs Excipients Working Group has been formed to develop a strategy for conducting a high-level scientific literature review to scope out acceptable excipients for children. Secondly, the working group will determine a prioritization process for selected excipients based on: the strength of the literature evidence; broad applicability across the pharmaceutical industry; and, potential for endorsement in Europe, US and worldwide following regulatory screening. 
A number of issues have thus far emerged related to determination on how estimates have been made of acceptable recipients exposure, the availability of developmental toxicology information, and identification of gaps in information and knowledge. 
The Specialized Information Services of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has joined the pediatric excipients initiative as a co-sponsor, to provide advice about how best to structure the search of those items that are difficult to search, search for untapped sources of information, suggestion of toxicology experts, participate in the searching process and to discuss the availability of  resources and support at NLM.
Development of an excipients database in pediatrics: Minimal Data Base Elements.
The joint EU-US PFIs Excipients Working Group has concluded that a simple search will not produce the needed information and that a clearly defined focus will yield meaningful information.  At this time the clinical consequences of excipient exposure in children are largely unknown. In addition an accepted daily and cumulative intake of recipients have not been established in pediatrics 
A detailed review will be needed define and establish the scope of knowledge gaps, update data on purported toxicities, and identify excipients that may impose a toxicity risk if included in pediatric formulations.
The data base structure will follow a modular model. The initial step wills the creation of a minimal database module to which other components will be added. .
Overall purpose of the excipients data base in pediatrics
	To characterize the prevalence and spectrum of symptoms and/or laboratory findings of clinically significant toxicity.
	To identify knowledge gaps and needed studies or providing the basis for the development of  hypothesis-driven safety or toxicity studies.
	To conduct a high-level scientific literature review of the pharmacology, toxicology and safety data of a selected group of excipients used in pediatric formulations. 
	To identify developmental pharmacology/toxicology findings of clinical significance.
	To determine the relationship between exposure and evidence of clinically significance toxicity in the pediatric age group as a whole, or in pediatric subpopulations. 
 Purpose of this RFI
The purpose of this RFI is to seek input from potential users on the data elements and information to be collected in a minimal and expanded Data Base of excipients used in pediatric formulations. 
This is a time-sensitive Request for Information that will be used to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only .This is a Request for Information (RFI) NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This RFI should not be construed as an obligation in any way on the part of the United States (U.S.) Federal government.  The Federal Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted and/or for the government's use of that information. Additionally, the government cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the information provided. (See Confidentiality Section below).

The Alec River (AR) - Black Lake (BL) watershed on the Alaskan Peninsula is one such system where we can see the effects of high magnitude events and the resulting sediment delivery to the lake over time (Ruggerone, 1994). Buffington (2002) and Elhakeem and Papanicolaou (2008) have documented changes to the AR-BL system, specifically the BL geomorphology (Figure 1), which have resulted from several large magnitude events that occurred between 1960 and 2000. Overall, these changes in lake geometry have severely threatened the highly productive salmon population of the system. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Cambria','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin"><br />In hopes of abating the deteriorating conditions of the AR-BL system, the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and the Chignik Regional Aquaculture Association (CRAA) have identified the following four priority objectives that are needed to evaluate the lake sedimentation issues and facilitate restoration efforts in the AR-BL system: </span></p>

<p>Instrument Features</p>
<p>Ability to abort a test and/or segment in a test when operator specified conditions are met.</p>
<p>Ability to modify a run in progress, including the ability to add segments to an active run.</p>
<p>Balance designed with automated furnace closing and experiment initiation in one keystroke.</p>
<p>Must have local control at the module including experiment start/stop and real-time display of sample temperature and experiment status.</p>
<p>Automatic recording of initial sample weight.</p>
<p>Automated push button taring. One button push loads pan, raises furnace, tares pan, and unloads pan.</p>
<p>Ability to continue a run when disconnected from the computer/controller.<br />Ability to use pans up to 250 microliter volume so as to fit larger samples in thermobalance.</p>
<p>Ability to store calibration constants in module memory</p>
<p>TGA shall include high-sensitivity, temperature-controlled thermobalance as described below.</p>
<p>TGA shall include IR-radiation furnace, as described below.</p>
<p>TGA must include evolved gas analysis (EGA) capability without resorting to a second furnace.</p>
<p>TGA must be easily interfaced to a Mass Spectrometer or FTIR, and shall accommodate a heated purge gas outlet to minimize condensation. The relative temperature of the heated outlet must be software controlled.</p>
<p>TGA must include touch screen for easy controller access and monitoring.</p>
<p>TGA must communicate with computer/controller through Ethernet BUS.</p>
<p>TGA must include dual digital mass flow controllers. Flow rate must be programmable within operating software, and deliverable as a saved signal in the data file. Mass flow controllers must also allow for automated gas switching during an experiment.</p>
<p>Data files contain measured sample temperature, not calculated temperature. This allows the user to know what temperature the sample is actually at during different heating rate experiments and makes for accurate and precise transition temperatures.</p>
<p>TGA must demonstrate the ability to continuously measure sample weight loss of up to 100 mg.</p>
<p>TGA must employ single thermocouple design with continuous use of the measured sample temperature to control the furnace so as to minimize thermal lag.<br /><br />TGA must employ horizontal purge gas flow to minimize buoyancy effects from purge gas and for direct output to off gas analysis.</p>
<p>TGA must employ push button automatic loading and unloading of sample pan. Operator does not have to hang pan on wire in normal use.</p>
<p>TGA must demonstrate ability to have up to five points for temperature calibration to provide greater temperature accuracy over wide temperature ranges. It must also be capable of Curie Point temperature calibration using an integrated electromagnet, the power of which can be preset.</p>
<p>Thermobalance</p>
<p>TGA must employ a vertical null-balance design for accurate, precise and reliable weighing of samples. The stabilized meter movement is maintained at 40.00 &deg;C in the balance housing by 3 strip heaters. It must be well insulated, electrically grounded, separately gas purged, and thermally isolated from the furnace. This is essential for high performance baseline performance.</p>
<p>Furnace</p>
<p>The furnace should employ infrared heating with a ceramic IR absorber for the rapid response needed for the most demanding applications in standard and high heating rate operation. Furnaces employing metal heater windings are not acceptable. It should also have an internal quartz liner to permit direct operation as an Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) furnace to handle decomposition products that might adhere to furnace internal features.</p>
<p>The furnace design should include a horizontal gas purge system using multiple digital mass flow controllers to provide highly accurate and precise control purge gas flow rate and gas switching capability. The system software should include automatic buoyancy corrections for temperature and gas flow rate.</p>
<p>The furnace must include integrated electromagnetic coil for convenient Curie Point temperature calibration. The coil power is software controlled.</p>
<p>The combined thermobalance and furnace should be capable of operating in vacuum of 1 x 10-2 torr.</p>
<p>Software</p>
<p>The DSC must include operating software which allows for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence. Calibrations must include weight and temperature. Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform outside normal work periods, such as overnight or on weekends. The software must also be capable of sending automatic communications as to the status of these calibration/verification experiments so that the operator is fully apprised of their status.</p>
<p>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component. These tests should verify the performance of various instrument components such as furnace components, motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. The results of these tests should be logged and the option to automatically report the result should be included.</p>
<p>The operating software should also be capable of periodically and automatically checking for updates via an internet connection, and downloading/installing those updates if desired.</p>
<p>The data analysis software should be unkeyed, to allow for unlimited installations within one site. The data file format should easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents, which are readable by the same data analysis package. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.</p>
<p><br />Performance</p>
<p>The instrument should be able to control the heater to optimize weight loss resolution and separate overlapping thermal transitions.<br /><br />1) Dynamic Heating Rate to automatically and continuously change heating <br />rate as a function of decomposition (sample weight loss).</p>
<p>2) Constant Reaction Rate to automatically and continuously change heating <br />rate to achieve a pre-determined rate of sample decomposition expressed in <br />%/min.<br /><br />3) Stepwise Isothermal to automatically change from heating to an isothermal <br />hold when pre-selected limits of weight loss in %/min are met.</p>
<p>Modulated TGA</p>
<p>The instrument should be capable of performing modulated analyses by applying a sinusoidal temperature wave to a sample.</p>
<p>The amplitude of sine wave should include &plusmn; 0.01 to 10&deg;C with a period from 100 to 1000 seconds.</p>
<p>Calculate and display on a continuous basis in real time the following kinetic decomposition parameters:<br />-Activation energy (kJ/mol)<br />-Log (Pre-exponential factor) (1/min) <br />-ln (rate ratio)<br />-Weight amplitude (mg/min)<br />-Modulated Temp (&deg;C).</p>
<p>Delivers above kinetic parameters of decomposition in a single scan (data file)</p>
<p>Calculate kinetic parameters by Discrete Fourier Transformation.</p>
<p>Modulate temperature during quasi-isothermal methods to evaluate the decomposition kinetics of a single weight loss.<br /><br />The government anticipates award of a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the specifications will be most advantageous to the government.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology currently has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art ion mobility spectrometers (IMS) for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program, in part, is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). NIST is currently developing standards for aviation security and requires a new state-of-the-art trace explosive detector system.</p>
<p>Since the system will be used to support aviation security in the United States, the system must be approved for use by the TSA. Currently, there are only two instruments on the TSA qualified products list: the Morpho Itemiser DX and the Smiths Ionscan 500DT. Since NIST already owns one of the latter instruments, we require a Morpho Itemiser DX Trace Detector System.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement. This brand name product is required because it is the only brand that is listed on the TSA qualified products list that NIST does not currently own. ***</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) NEW (Not Refurbished) Morpho Itemiser DX Trace Detector System</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the firm that provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. Technical acceptability means that the quote meets all of the stated minimum specifications.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>No used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) on behalf of the Fogarty International Center (FIC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with White Point Systems, Inc., 520 Spring St., Friday Harbor, WA  98250 for the continued operation of the Global Data Center.
The NICHD intends to negotiate a two year contract with three option years with White Point Systems, Inc. for the continued support of the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) Global Data Center. 
The ICBG is a research program supported through cooperative grants that supports multidisciplinary teams composed of scientists in the U.S. and in low and middle income countries.  This research program is managed by FIC and sponsored by five agencies of the U.S. government. The Global Data Center provides data from all of the ICBGs that links all of the steps of the data pipeline from material collection through drug discovery.
In 1998, White Point Systems created the proprietary database called Natural Products Information System (NAPIS) as part of the original grant that mines data for emergent patterns of information, compared across data in a format that can be used by grantees and the FIC Technical Advisory Group. The Global Data Center also optimizes data management and trains the members of the ICBG in skills associated with using a relational database and facilitates the dissemination of non-proprietary products of this program to the public. In the course of this new contract, the Government intends to use the improved features of NPAIS developed during the previous contract with WPS.
In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need to develop or have an operational database that could mine the data in a way that would be useful and relevant for the current grantees and the Government.  Additionally, a new prospective contractor must have demonstrated successful professional relationships with researchers and members of the FIC Technical Advisory Group as well as demonstrated successful marketing strategies and networks in order to publicize the availability of the data to researchers and government agencies in order to maximize this valuable resource.   
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, White Point Systems, Inc. is the only source capable of continuing these services without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as well as unacceptable delays and loss of consistency make competition unfeasible for the continuation of this project. Interested parties may submit their interest and corporate capability statements in response to the requirements as described above in writing. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is an RFP currently available. All interested parties may submit their statements to the point of contact below to the contracting office address no later than Thursday, June 24, 2010 3 p.m. E.S.T. See numbered Note 22.

NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED.  RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES.  

Capability statements should be sent to:

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Diode-Pumped Solid State Lasers (DPSS) with Option to Purchase additional.
<p>(I) This is combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number RA1341-10-RQ-0735DR.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 334516. The small business size standard is 500.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for the purchase of the following commercial items: <br />CLIN NO. 0001 - Diode-Pumped Solid State Lasers (DPSS), Qty 1 each, in accordance with the specifications.<br />CLIN NO. 0002- Option I: Diode-Pumped Solid State Lasers (DPSS), Qty 1 each, in accordance with the specifications.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />Specifications, the following specifications apply to both line items:</p>
<p>Scope: The National Institute of Standards (NIST) Quantum Physics Division has a requirement of one diode-pumped solid state lasers (DPSS) with the option to purchase one additional identical DPSS. The DPSS is part of a laser system to generate ultrashort optical pulses for various experiments and measurements. One set of experiments and measurements includes study of fundamental physics in potassium vapor, and for optical second harmonic generation in correlated electron materials such as high temperature superconductors and mixed valence materials. Another set of experiments and measurements are used to study pulse dynamics and in the future will be used as excitations source for optical two-dimensional Fourier transform spectroscopy of semiconductors. These studies are critical to the Quantum Physics Division mission to develop fundamental measurement science in the ultrafast regime.</p>
<p>The DPSS is part of a larger laser system. The DPSS is used as a light source (pump) for a titanium-doped sapphire (Ti:Sapphire) mode-locked laser which generates the required ultrashort optical pulses.</p>
<p>The NIST Quantum Physics Division is part of JILA, a joint research institute between NIST and the University of Colorado - Boulder. The NIST Quantum Physics Division is physically located in the University of Colorado JILA Tower building, which is on the campus of the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. The DPSS laser(s) will be used in the JILA Tower building and is/are to be delivered to that location.</p>
<p>Specifications: Reliability: Only diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) technology is acceptable. The newer optically pumped semiconductor laser (OPSL) technology is not acceptable because of reliability issues. The experiments require a highly reliable pump laser that requires a minimum of servicing to maximize productivity and minimize the cost of ownership. DPSS lasers are an established technology with a 15 year record of success and continuing improvements in performance and reliability. The newer OPSL technology can provide general performance specifications similar to DPSS, but the newer OPSL technology does not yet have the record of long-term reliability. For the applications for this procurement, reliability is a significant requirement, and only the proven DPSS technology is acceptable.</p>
<p>Output power: &gt; 5 Watts continuous wave<br />Output wavelength: 532 nm<br />Mode quality: TEM00, M2 &lt; 1.1, ellipticity &lt; 10%<br />Beam Diameter: 2.3 mm &plusmn; 10% at 1/e2 points<br />Beam Divergence: &lt; 0.5 mrad full angle<br />Input power: Single phase 110 V AC, 60 Hertz<br />Power Stability: &plusmn; 1% over 2 hour period after 15 minute warm up<br />Noise: &lt; 0.04% RMS, 10 Hz - 10 MHz at 5 W output power<br />Polarization: Linear (Vertical), &gt; 100:1<br />Beam pointing: stable to &le; 2 microrad/C<br />Technology: Diode-pumped solid-state laser with a sealed enclosure and permanently aligned optics<br />(Note: Optically Pumped Semiconductor laser (OPSL) technology is not acceptable because the applications require the proven long-term reliability of DPSS technology.)<br />Installation: The price must include on-site installation of the laser(s).<br />Warranty: minimum of 2 years or 10,000 hours</p>
<p>Offerors should quote the price for one laser, with an option for a second identical laser.</p>
<p>Offerors may include trade-in allowance for an existing laser, at the discretion of the offeror. The existing laser consists of a head (Model: Millennia, S/N 1646) and power supply (Model: T40-855-08, S/N: 81288). The chiller will not be included as part of the trade-in - it will be retained by NIST. If the vendor wishes to include a trade-in allowance, the proposal should clearly specify the trade-in value of the laser.</p>
<p>(VII) Required delivery 45 days ARO. Place of delivery is the JILA Tower building on the University of Colorado campus: <br />University of Colorado / JILA<br />CU JILA Tower<br />Room S175<br />Boulder, Colorado 80309<br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination. Quote shall include shipping if applicable. Payment Terms are Net-30.</p>

The following clauses are incorporated by full text; 5252.204-9400 Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010), Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and i! mplement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DOD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DOD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives. This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DOD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained. DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DOD/DON instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract. The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Command's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer. Non-Sensitive Positions: Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as requ! ired by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DOD instruction) and Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access. To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards, Original Signed Release Statements. The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Sensitive Positions: Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DOD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DOD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access. To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete: SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards, Original Signed Release Statements. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DOD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. IT Systems Access: When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required. Security Approval Process: The Contractor's Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Command's Security Manager.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Command's Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Command's Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employee's anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Command's Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment. A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Command's Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Command's Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately. The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information, and 5252.NS-046P Prospective Contractor Responsibility (AUG 2001) FISC Norfolk: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9.1, the Contracting Officer shall award contracts only to responsible offerors. No purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility.

<p><br />A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) is an essential element of the U.S. Government's support for the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. Over the past several years, USAID/WBG has devoted more than half of its funds to supporting the development of infrastructure, particularly in the water sector. USAID's strategy, aimed directly at one of the greatest needs in this arid region, has been to increase water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Mission has financed both large-scale well-drilling and water pipeline projects in the Bethlehem-Hebron and Jenin areas as well as smaller, village-scale projects throughout the West Bank and Gaza. This has provided potable water to more than 1,500,000 Palestinian beneficiaries. In addition, USAID has been addressing the development constraints caused by poor transportation infrastructure. In FY 2009, USAID rehabilitated 3.3 kilometers of internal roads throughout the West Bank to provide safer passage and easier movement for Palestinians living in villages and towns and constructed 8 major road segments 64 kilometers of main and regional roads to serve an estimated 7.8 million vehicle trips per year. The FY 2009 roads program resulted in new or improved infrastructure facilities for an estimated 8.8 million vehicle trips per year. This is part of a larger USAID effort to restore transportation infrastructure that is vital for improved mobility and economic growth. In support of this effort, USAID is currently constructing nine new roads and rehabilitating internal roads in different locations and plans to implement similar work in the future. USAID is also considering initiating waste water treatment pilot programs and plants in the future if funds are available.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the salient characteristics of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the salient characteristics is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.&nbsp; Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 30 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 02 July 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200144 in subject line.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the salient characteristics of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the salient characteristics is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.&nbsp; Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 29 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 30 June 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200145 in subject line.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This preliminary review work will allow the strategy development and implementation processes to be centered on the Joint Base Anacostia - Bolling's current operational environment and critical success factors.<br />1.4.1.1 - Review Joint Base Anacostia - Bolling current strategic plan documents, related Air Force and Navy operational directives, and applicable Commander's briefings and discussion papers.<br />1.4.1.2 Prepare an interview guide to gain additional strategic input from leadership responsible for the joint basing initiative in regard to:<br />&bull; Strategic opportunities and organizational strengths.<br />&bull; Operational obstacles/risks and organizational weaknesses.<br />&bull; Operational expectations of primary customers and stakeholders who are impacted by the joint basing initiative.<br />&bull; Core internal operational services, processes, and activities to meet customers' and stakeholders' expectations.<br />&bull; Core infrastructure (i.e., people, computer systems, facilities) required to support internal joint basing needs and operational processes.<br />1.4.1.3 Conduct interviews with selected members of the Air Force and Navy leadership teams who have responsibility for or are being significantly impacted by the joint base initiative.

This draft Strategy Map and a draft workshop agenda will be reviewed with the Air Force and Navy Commanders one week prior to the start of the SA&amp;D Workshop. <br />1.4.3.1 - Consolidate interview comments and draft Joint Base Anacostia - Bolling Strategy Map.<br />1.4.3.2 Prepare pre-workshop commanders' briefing support documents which will include a draft agenda for the SA&amp;D Workshop.<br />1.4.3.3 Facilitate pre-workshop briefing for the Air Force and Navy Commanders and their appropriate support team.<br />1.4.3.4 Adjust draft Strategy Map and finalize workshop agenda based on input from pre-workshop briefing. <br />1.4.4 SA&amp;D Three-Day Workshop. The purpose of the SA&amp;D Workshop is to complete an understandable, enduring, executable Strategy Map, establish a strategy governance process, develop strategy communication plans, and review lessons learned in cascading and integrating the strategic plan throughout the Joint Base Anacostia - Bolling operations. This deliverable will establish the rigor required to have an effective and workable strategy management process based on a high level of leadership ownership and accountability and to identify key performance indicators to drive continuous process improvements.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide responses to the following questions posed by potential offerors:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />The requirement for the(5)units states that each unit needs to have(8) quad core 64-bit CPU's. The industry does not have platform that can cater (8) CPU's. We can get something that can accept (4) CPU's. Please advise.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 1:<br /></span></strong>Our market research indicates that eight CPU systems are&nbsp;commercially available.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:</span></strong><br />I noticed you were asking for 8x quad-core CPUs. I assume you are looking for the 8-way servers with Opteron 8000 series CPUs. However, there is newer technology out there that would perform better and is a lot more cost effective (CPUs would cost $1000 instad of $2000 each and we'd need half as many, plus they perform much better). We are interested in possibly proposing a 4-way 8-core system with 2.4GHz CPUs. While the CPU speed is 2.4GHz instead of 2.6GHz, benchmarks show that the new 2.4GHz CPUs perform faster than the older 2.6GHz CPUs. This is due to faster memory (DDR3 1333MHz instead of DDR2 at 800MHz) and bus speeds, as well as better CPU/Memory speeds. The space required is also a lot smaller (will fit in a 1U instead of a 5U). Would you be interested in something like this? Or should we stay with the 2.6GHz Shanghai system?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 2:</span></strong><br />Yes, we are interested in newer technology systems. At the time our requirement was formulated, these systems were not available.</p>
<p>The fundamental requirement is that the systems should have 32 cores which can access 128 GB of shared memory. We agree that the higher memory bus speed does compensate adequately for the slower processor clock speed. Provided a proposed system meets the per-system core count and shared memory capacity, it will be acceptable.</p>

<DESC>Responses to questions submitted concerning N273810049
1.	What entity, government or commercial currently provides the requested training to the NPS?
These services are currently provided by a commercial entity under contract with the NPS.  
2.	Under Section 2, Scope of Services, the second paragraph indicates that the "National Park Service (NPS) Fundamentals III:  Retirement Planning for New Employees" course will be provided at least five times per fiscal year, with one offering of this topic on each of the five dates negotiated after contract award.  Does a "negotiated date" mean a single calendar day, or could it mean more than one calendar day per course offering?
The class, "Retirement Planning for New Employees," will be delivered five times, on five different calendar days throughout the year, as negotiated with the successful contractor.  The exact same content will be presented every 4 to 6 weeks, for a total of five throughout the year.
3.	Under Task  1, the final sentence indicates that each broadcast will be approximately two (2) hours per iteration.  Does the NPS intend for the vendor to address all topics listed under Task 2, within a single two hour presentation, or will the topics be addressed over multiple two (2) hour broadcasts such that each "course" consists of two or more broadcasts?
The topics will be delivered in the two hour program.  This is an overview class, so in depth detail of each topic area will not be necessary.  The exact same content delivered in a two hour block, five times throughout the year is what will be required. 
4.	Task 2 requires that instructors have professional experience of financial planning.  Please clarify what the NPS means by the term "professional experience of financial planning".  Does this mean that the presenter must be a Certified Financial Planner?
A Certified Financial Planner would be preferred, but as long as the contractor can demonstrate proficiency in the financial planning topics, a Certified Financial Planner is not required.  
5.	Course content requirements listed under Task 2 are fairly comprehensive.  Is it the intent of the NPS to have the instructor cover all these topics within a single 2 hour broadcast?
Yes.  Again, this is an overview of the topics for employees that are brand new to the National Park Service.  Extensive coverage of each topic will not be necessary.   
6.	Section 3.1 indicates that offers shall be submitted by e-mail only to the NPS.  What is the maximum attachment file size the NPS can accommodate?
Anything submitted beyond the 10 page limitation for the Part 2 technical approach of the proposal will not be considered or evaluated.  Therefore, maximum e-mail attachment size is not expected to be an issue for responses to this solicitation.  
7.	If the file size of the electronic participant guide and PowerPoint presentation exceeds e-mail limitations, what is the preferred delivery method the NPS would like vendors to use to ensure timely delivery of this file with the remainder of the offeror's proposal?
The participant guide and PowerPoint presentation are not themselves necessary submittals in response to this solicitation.  Anything submitted beyond the 10 page limitation for the Part 2 technical approach of the proposal will not be considered or evaluated.  
8.	Section 3.3.2 Proposal Content indicates that proposals should include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its proposal.  Is a statement that the offeror's ORCA file is up to date and that exceptions are specifically noted (if any) sufficient, or does the NPS require a full electronic file of the Reps and Certs complement the proposal?   
Yes, a statement that the offeror's ORCA file is up to date is sufficient.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010) Worldwide Protective Services (WPS) The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. SPECIAL NOTES: 1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work. Anticipated Acquisition Schedule DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract. The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. The Question and Answer (Q &amp;A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 26, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date. Parties attending the pre-proposal conference may submit questions in writing at the end of the conference. Interested parties may submit additional questions up to May 12, 2010; 5:30 PM EDT.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the salient characteristics of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the salient characteristics is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.&nbsp; Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 30 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 02 July 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200144 in subject line.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The following is Questions and Answers 2 of 2:<br /><br />25. Will the contractor who developed the program of instruction for the advanced course be allowed to bid on the contract?<br /><br />The contractor developed POI for AHTC has been significantly modified by the Government. Because of the changes in the POI, the Government feels that the contractor that developed the POI will not have an unfair advantage in delivering the services specified in the SOW. The contractor had no part in writing the current SOW and had very little part in providing the POI that will be used to develop the curriculum for the contract awarded from Solicitation HHM-402-10-R-0132. According to FAR 9.505-2, the contractor who assisted in the development of the POI will be allowed to submit a proposal.<br /><br /><br />This concludes all Q&amp;As.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate the following two focus areas for FY10: Survivable Information Management and Tactical Information Management and (2) Change the FY10 recommended dates for white papers for these two topic areas only.
<p>(1) Insert the following two topic areas under I. Funding Opportunity Description:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FY10 Focus Areas</span>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survivable Information Management</span></p>
<p>Survivable systems are capable of adapting their behavior, function, and resource allocation in response to a variety of intermittent and permanent disruptions to maintain adequate levels of mission functionality. Understanding the operational range of expected deployment configurations and survivability requirements is a necessary condition to instrumenting a responsive survivable system. This task focuses on the development of operationally relevant, mission focused, deployment scenarios and survivability requirements. This task also requires the specification of an assessment framework for evaluating the efficacy of approaches to address survivability requirements within the context of varied deployment configurations.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to:<br />&bull; identify operational deployments for Information Management (IM) services focusing on tactical environments. <br />&bull; identify and describe missions and mission scenarios within tactical operational deployments that capitalize on the use of IM services.<br />&bull; define mission centric survivability requirements that identify and describe required levels of IM service quality and availability. <br />&bull; define, design and implement an assessment framework which will be used to test and assess survivability techniques in mission oriented, operationally relevant contexts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tactical Information Management</span></p>
<p>Tactical Information Management (TIM) has many of the same objectives as IM as discussed in the master BAA 10-08-RIKA announcement, but with the added focus on dismounted users, improved radio-based communications and resource constraints that aren't present in enterprise-class defense applications. Emphasis for this research will be on a series of demonstrations with feedback from real users to learn practical lessons and improve the overall system.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to focus on the exploration of techniques applicable to tactical situations for: <br />&bull; improving effective/reliable communications in low bandwidth (as low as 2 kbps) situations<br />&bull; service discovery and prioritization<br />&bull; TIM interfaces in a resource-constrained environment<br />&bull; effective management of various tactical data types in a manner that is relevant to dismounted users<br />&bull; effective, prioritized reach-back to federated systems in a bandwidth-aware manner</p>
<p>Offerors are also encouraged to build upon existing IM and QOS components for this work, including the AFRL-developed Advanced Information Management System (AIMS), Marti, and Phoenix/Fawkes, in order to maximize productivity for the research, and to provide maximum benefit to the Government.<br />(2) The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the two topic areas above is 24 June 2010.</p>
<p>All other information remains the same.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Technical Support Contract (TSC) is in support of Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) missions as well as Research and Development (RDT&amp;E). As a result, money will be separated amongst two CLINs. Historically, the work required in accordance with the Statement of Work is a 70/30 split (70% RDT&amp;E and 30% O&amp;M). Throughout the course of the contract, when a task surfaces, the program will provide clear instruction as to whether the work is classified as RDT&amp;E versus O&amp;M so the contractor will be fully aware of the appropriate billing method. Under the circumstances, we ask you to price out your work in accordance with the Section L instructions to allow for cost analysis. When determining your pricing please take the SOW requirements and workload history (Annex 2) into consideration and then when inputting the values into Section B of the solicitation, take the bottom line value for the work and apply 70% to the R&amp;D CLIN and 30% to the O&amp;M CLIN.

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support </strong>(OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Information&nbsp;Systems &amp; Global Services to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). </span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The extended period of performance is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1&nbsp;July 2010 through 31&nbsp;January 2011</span> to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data&nbsp;and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN&nbsp;Remote Tracking Station antennas&nbsp;for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by 4:30 pm MDST,&nbsp;11 June&nbsp;2010, via email to the attention of:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><a href="mailto:jordan.huggins@schriever.af.mil">jordan.huggins@schriever.af.mil</a> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">and <a href="mailto:kathryn.dillon@schriever.af.mil">kathryn.dillon@schriever.af.mil</a></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">.

<DESC>RECOVERY  This project is funded by the American Recovery and reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the requirements of the act.  Solicitation will be posted at fedbizopps.gov on or about 14 Oct 2009.  No paper copies will be sent. Notifications of any changes will be made as modifications to this announcement.

The Plumas National Forest has a need for improvements at the Cottonwood Springs Campground, Beckwourth Ranger District.  These improvements include a new potable water distribution system, toilet and shower facilities, and connections to the existing potable water and waste water systems.  Project includes approximately 5000 linear feet of main distribution line, approximately 1800 linear feet of secondary lines, approximately 18 accessible hydrants, electrical control system, connections to existing potable water storage and wastewater handling systems, furnishing and/or construction of accessible toilet and shower facilities, and demolition and disposal of exiting utilities, facilities and structures.

100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the authority of PL 108-183 Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, Section 308.  

This is a Design/Build project and is prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 36 and as authorized by section 4105 of the Clinger-Cohen Act and is supplemented with additional information included in the solicitation.  The Design-Build process has two distinct phases.  The solicitation incorporates both phases.  Phase I is the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select up to THREE contractors on the basis of their qualifications and preliminary proposal(s).  ONLY the selected contractors will then qualify for the Phase II process.  In Phase II of the procurement procedure Contractors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and/or technical approach and cost proposals.  Final selection and basis for award will be qualifications, past experience, technical quality, price and other salient factors considered to be the best value to the Government.    

Contractors are urged and expected to attend a site visit which will be held on October 20, 2009 at 10 am (PDT) at the Beckwourth District Office, 23 Mohawk Road in Blairsden, CA.  Contact George Butler gbutler@fs.fed.us or Andrea Seiler aseiler@fs.fed.us for more information.  They can also be reached at 530-283-2050.  Weather will be an issue later in the year and this will be the only time available for you to inspect the job site.  Inspection of the job site is necessary in order to prepare an informed proposal for the construction phase of this project.  

NAICS code:  237110      Magnitude:  $500,000-$1,000,000
Phase I Design Proposals are due October 29, 2009, by 2:00 PM (PDT).

<DESC>This project consists of replacing an existing 24 corrugated steel culvert with a 72 corrugated steel culvert on Forest Road 648 (Lower Cougar Road). Other types of work included in this project are placing riprap aprons, streambed simulation inside the new culvert, channel realignment and replacement of roadway and aggregate. The project location is at M.P 1.5 on FS Road 648. Approximately 10 miles from the intersection of Forest Road 244 and State Route 13 near Harpster Idaho. The distance from Grangeville is approximately 20 miles.  Estimated price range for the project is $25,000-$100,000.  The scope of work was changed during the solicitation preparation to include aggregate placement on 0.64 miles of Forest Road 1851.  Because of this change, soliciting this project as an emerging small business set-aside was no longer appropriate.  Therefore, solicitation is now being issued as a total HUBzone small business set-aside.  Quoters must be certified HUBzone concerns with the U.S. Small Business Administration in order to be considered.  For information regarding the on-line application process, go to the following website: https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/.  Please note that this process can take 120 days or more to complete.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.

<DESC>The previous synopsis posted on or about June 03, 2010 is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following.  This modification is to correct the specifications to reflect end cap requirements of the AUV 5000V2 Side Scan Sonar.  This modification will also extend the closing date from 17 June 2010 to 18 June 2010 at 2pm central standard time.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to L-3 Communications Klein Associates, Inc., 11 Klein Drive, Salem, NH 03079 to procure the following:
One (1) each Klein Model AUV 5000V2 Dynamically Focused Multi-Beam Side Scan Sonar with NSWC end-cap for SPU, comprised of:-  Sonar Processor Unit (SPU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104577-01-  Sonar Electronics Unit (SEU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104568-  Port Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Starboard Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Deck Power Supply, P/N 11700053-  Jumper Cable, 100 inch, P/N 12900916-01-  Deck Cable, 20m, P/N 14104595-  SonarPro (CD) Visualization Software License, P/N 14104488--  Manual (CD), P/N 11214513
This procurement is sole source for the following reasons:  This L-3 Klein Sonar is required for continued operation of a fielded system incorporating the previous version of this sonar system.  The form and fit of this new sonar is identical to that of the original system.  More importantly, the data stream from the new version of the system is identical to that of the existing system, maintaining full functional compatibility.  To change to any other sonar system at this time would require significant redesign efforts for the fielded system, in particular the processing of the data, which would negate any potential savings from attempting to competitively selecting a different sonar system.  The design of this system, including the end cap for NSWC, is proprietary to L-3 Klein and not available through any of its distributors, thus L-3 Klein is the only source for these systems.
The NAICS code is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees and the FSC is 5845.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  NSWC PCD contact is:  Scott Dubuque, 850-234-4864, Scott.Dubuque@navy.mil

<DESC>****UPDATE:  Amendment 002, Answers to Vendor Questions posted on June 09, 2010.


The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the American Embassy in Luxembourg.  The U.S. Embassy Luxembourg requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.  The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.  Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about April 09, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed.  The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows:  The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.  Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals.  All dates are subject to change.  Offerors will be notified.
A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Embassy Luxembourg.  A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Luxembourg.  Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit.

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Matthew J. Colantonio at ColantonioMJ@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 


In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to acquire new package screening devices for detecting contraband material. These devices would be used at any venue at which DHS needs to ensure the safety of a protected zone by scanning handbags, backpacks, luggage, parcels, etc. In order for DHS to select the device(s) that optimally fulfills the requirements of various operational environments, the DHS Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Operational Experimentation Program (OEP) seeks to conduct a series of experiments using detection equipment in realistic, operational scenarios in order to examine the performance limits of the devices. The devices are not being evaluated to a specific set of performance criteria; rather, their performance in each category will be noted, and individual DHS components may use this information with respect to their particular operational needs.<br /><br /><br />RFI HSHQDC-10-R-00059, Paragraph II. Objective,&nbsp;is hereby amended as follows:&nbsp; (Amended language is underlined.)
<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman Bold'">"Paragraph II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Objective:</span></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">DHS S&amp;T is soliciting information on currently available devices for the detection of contraband (weapons, explosives, etc.) hidden within personal items, luggage, or packages, that could potentially meet various DHS requirements of portability, ruggedness, and reliability. Vendors interested in submitting technologies will be asked to provide a demonstration unit for an experiment to be conducted in October 2010, for no more than two (2) weeks, at a venue to be determined, along with personnel to set-up the provided equipment and to train DHS-supplied operators. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: double;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman Bold'">This product characterization series is for devices that can scan packages up to a maximum size of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>35" by 35". </span></span></em></strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, it is preferred that the devices be on TSL's Qualified Products List (QPL) or have undergone or are currently proceeding through an equivalent qualification by a separate third party. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">preliminary</em> list of capabilities desired for the assessment is provided in Table 1.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 and Amendment 0002 are available for download.<BR><BR>The Ohio Riverfront Cincinnati, Ohio, Walnut Street Event Lawn project is located in Hamilton County, Ohio. The work for the second contract will take place on top of a recently constructed parking garage near the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. To the north and south, independent projects are being constructed in association with the Banks development including roadway improvements, multiuse development buildings with subsurface parking garages, and a realigned/reconstructed roadway. Immediately adjacent and to the west is the Phase I site. It is anticipated that Phase I will be awarded this month, May 2010. The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies.<BR><BR><BR>Construction will take place on-structure, atop a parking garage designed to accommodate parking for special events, park and city visitors and those working at the many businesses throughout the downtown area. Site preparation for this contract will require installing a waterproofing system on the roof of the parking garage. The waterproofing will consist of applying a hot fluid over the concrete deck. The fluid is a rubberized asphalt system with protection board and root barriers. Associated with the work are concrete repairs, sealant joints, and 3 compression joints with cover plates. The waterproofing contractor will be responsible for deck preparation; furnishing and installing the system; and providing protection and repairs to the system during installation of the surface features. The contractor must be certified to install the system and provide a five year warranty. The main feature consists of the Event Lawn, which will provide a place for public gatherings both large and small. A granite paved walkway will be constructed along the west and south edges of the lawn. On the western edge, a stage and canopy will be constructed facing the lawn. The stage is a raised platform paved in granite with a shade structure above. Decorative lighting will be incorporated into the ceiling and also mounted to the canopy's columns. Speakers will be strategically placed at the canopy and at certain areas of the lawn in order to accommodate major festivals that require sound. The lawn rises one and a half feet from the west to the east. The grade change is contained by stone seatwalls to the north and south, the east and west ends are flush with surrounding grade. Within the lawn sit specimen shade trees, alternating with pedestrian post top lights, and punctuated by several sets of stone steps. <BR><BR><BR>This is set-aside for Small Businesses. The proposals will be evaluated based on a best value source selection process. The selection process will evaluate such factors as: Prime Contractor Past Experience and Prime Contractor Past Performance, Price, and Pro Forma information. The estimated cost range for this project is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990, with a size standard of $33.5M. The base construction contract duration is approximately 300 days. The approximate issue date is 21 May 2010 and approximate closing date is 21 June 2010, 11:00 am Eastern Time. Downloading of the project documents requires registration at the FedBizOps (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Amendments will be available from the FedBizOps website by download only.

<DESC>Work will be conducted at three different sites as described below. The three sites include; Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, and Lower Granite Lock and Dam. All three sites are located within Washington State along the Snake River. Lower Monumental Dam is located near Kahlotus, Little Goose Dam is near Starbuck, and Lower Granite Dam is near Pomeroy.<br /><br />The Diesel Generators to be replaced consist of the powerhouse emergency diesel generators. Currently, the generators are 4160V, 500kVA, 1970s vintage engine generators with relay control systems which are difficult to maintain and operate. Three Generators are scheduled to be replaced at three different locations: Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<br /><br />The switchgears scheduled to be replaced are designated as SQ2, includes 300kVA, 4160V-480V step-down transformers and feeds power to auxiliary systems, primarily for units 5 &amp; 6. The switchgear is currently Federal Pacific Electric, is considered unreliable and is difficult to maintain. Switchgears are scheduled to be replaced at two of the three locations: Lower Monumental Lock and Dam and Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<br /><br />The contract will require the supply and installation of three Diesel Generators and the associated control system components along with two SQ2 switchgear. Each generator replacement will include but is not limited to the installation of 750 kVA, 480V generator, 480-4160V step-up transformer, two 5kV circuit breakers (three at Lower Granite), load bank, day tank, PLC control system, and associated conduit, cabling and wires. SQ2 switchgear system replacement will include associated cabinets, circuit breakers, transformers, high resistance ground, and associated conduit, cabling and wires. Modifications to the existing switchboard will also be required. Additionally, the contract will require the removal, demolition and disposal of existing switchgear, relay control system and removal and salvage of the existing diesel generators. Concrete Patching, grouting and repair will also be required.<br /><br />The period of performance for the contract is approximately three years. The period of performance for onsite work is dependent upon the spring runoff and fish passage windows that generally provide seven to nine calendar months of on-site work access, each year. Submittals, manufacture, delivery and site preparation outside of the allowable outage windows may start anytime after award. Project site priority and coordination with other project work windows may also dictate other construction schedule requirements and restrictions.<br /><br />Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Pages/EM385-1-1,2008NEW!.aspx located at US Army Corps of Engineers homepage. Statement of Work includes working with and around medium voltage equipment and cabling, elevated work sites, restricted access areas and heavy machinery. <br /><br />Solicitation No. W912EF-10-R-0006 will be posted to the FBO website on or about May 7, 2010. Proposals will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.

<DESC>National Broker Solicitation No: VA-101-10-RP-0084 - Clarification 2
 
1.  Question:  The operational plan calls for 2 scenarios of 8 pages per scenario.  Is it acceptable to combine the page limitation to 16 pages as Scenario #1 requires more narrative than #2.

Answer:  Yes.  The operational Plan Page limitation:  Ten (10) pages of narrative information, plus eight (8) additional pages per scenario.

2.  Question:  Can the Amendment be released as a word document or a PDF?  There are some symbols in the version on fbo.gov that are unclear.

Answer:  The Solicitation and Amendment 1 was submitted as a word document to FBO.gov.  This office has no control over fbo.gov release format.

3.  Question:  Conflicts of Interest based on the response to Question 6 in Amendment 1.  Please clarify whether a company that represents both building owners and tenants is permitted to provide services under this contract.  It was our understanding that H.4 was included to allow a company to act as a dual agent using Exhibit 3C, through the establishment of a "conflict wall".  Would two awarded contractors (separate IDIQ's) be precluded from responding to each other's SFO's?  Why would the VA permit dual agency, but not allow one contractor to represent a landlord and bid on another contractor's task order?

Answer:  Federal regulations require fair and open competition.  Therefore, contractors acting as brokers for the VA will not be allowed to respond to SFO's issued by VA Real Property Service.

4.  Question:  Reference B.2.1 " subcontractions rates are proposed separately" and the response to Questioon 88.  Please clarify that the prime contractor has the option of submitting to VA a ingle set of prices that apply to services provided by both the prime and its subcontractios (unified pricing for the VA), and that it is not a requirement to submit separate rates.

Answer:  There is no requirement to submit separate rates for subcontractors.  however, if the contractor plans to use subcontractors those rates can be submitted separately.

5.  Question:  Reference the respons to Question 44.  When it states "Please provide costs for fee-based transactions, "does this require only contractors to fill out the hourly labor rates in Section B, or is other pricing required?

Answer:  C.5.9 Other Property Transactions require separate pricing.  Services under C.5.9 may be paid for on a commission of fee base as determined on a case-by-case bases.  Please provide costs for fee-based transactions outlined in section C.5.9. 

6.  Question:  Reference the response to Question 55.  When it states, "Print and submit with your proposal".  Does this mean to print, then scan, then include it as part of the electronic CD submission?  Or is VA asking contractors to print and submit as electronic copy?

Answer:  Print, scan and submit as part of the electronic CD submission.

7.  Question:  On page 101 the RFP states that, Subfactors 2 (a) Quality of Services/Cost Control/Timeliness/Business Relations
"This factor considers an offeror's (not only the corporate entity but also individual personnel) experience in perfdorming tenant representation commercial broker services similar to the services described in the solicitation within the last three years as a prime contrator".  At least five refernced clients will be contacted to verify the level of experience claimed.  As a minimum requirement for an acceptable score for this factor, an offeror shall demonstrate experience in providing services to at least two clients with nationwide service requirements".
Please confirm that qualifications of the subcontractors can be considered to meet this requirement.

Answer:  Subcontractors qualifications will be considered in accordance with the evaluation crieria set forth in Section M.

8.  Please confim that firms can submit in more than one proposal.  Can a firm submit as a prime on one team and as a sub on another team?

Answer:  Yes.

9.  Question:  Can VA personnel who are overseeing a current vendor's work be asked to submit a recommendation on behalf of an offeror for this solicitation?

Answer:  VA personnel can be used as reference.

10.  Question:  In an effort to be fully responsive and thorough on the Staffing Plan, we are unable to keep the page limitation to 5 pages which also includes 2 pages of resumes for the PM and APM.  My concern is that Factor 1 is the most important of the Technical evaluation criteria and the Staffing Plan is the most important Subfactor of Factor1.  I have the total page number at 7 including the resumes.  Will the VA consider increasing the page limitation for the Staffing Plan?

Answer:  Subfactor 1 (a); Staffing Plan page limitation is changed from five (5) pages to ten (10) pages.

11.  Question:  Exhibit 13 ( Regulations of the Attorney General Concerning Title) is included in the table of contents; however it is not included with the documentation.  Can you provide this Exhibit?

Answer:  Exhibit 13 provides guidance for the preparation of title in land acquisitions.  Contact the Department of Justice; Environment and Natural Resources Division land Acquisition Section; Title Standards 2001; A Guide for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisition by the U.S.A.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Energy Construction LLC Contract Number W912DQ-10-P-0146<br><br>The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and transportation necessary to clear all woody vegetation (including vines, briars, shrubs, and brush) from an area extending from the toe of the RIVER side of the levee back a distance of ten (10) feet.  All stump and stub cuts shall be horizontal (to preclude sharp stubs) and shall be cut as close to the ground as possible.  In no case shall any cut stumps or stubs exceed four (4) inches in height.  There will be numerous desirable (pecan, oak and ash) trees marked with paint that shall be left uncut.   At the edge of the newly cleared area, all limbs shall be removed from the standing timber to a height of seven (7) feet.  The contractor shall return to any area not accessible due to high water or wet conditions when conditions allow the work to be completed.  The area on the left bank levee between the two metal gates can be sprayed with an approved brush killer for the removal of the honeysuckle vine only.  <BR><BR>All cut woody vegetation shall be removed from the job site to a location, if desired, to an area provided by the government.   The government provided location is located in the Shawnee Bend Public Use Area, which would require transporting cut woody vegetation approximately a distance of six (6) miles or less.  The contractor also may elect to chip the cut woody vegetation; chips may be hauled away or shall be blown to the land side of the levee.  Wood chips shall not be left in piles exceeding four (4) inches.<BR><BR>C.5.2 Levees are used for flood control and under no condition shall the crown or slope be dug, rutted or altered.  Any equipment used at the base of slope or the top of the crown shall be used in such a manner to avoid damage.  If mechanical cutters are used they must be of a size as to not to rut or cut through the soil.  Dozing or uprooting will not be permitted.  The contractor shall, at their expense, return all disturbed areas to the original gradation/slope, to include seeding and mulching of damaged areas and/or rutted sod resulting from the use of equipment.<BR><BR>C.5.3 The Contractor shall apply Garlon 4 (or equivalent substitute, at the discretion of Project personnel) herbicide to all cut stubs, stumps, and stems.  An adequate marker dye shall be mixed with the chemical in sufficient concentration to leave an obvious and durable stain on the treated stubs, stumps, and stems.  All such stems shall be treated on the same day they are cut.<BR><BR>

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Contracting Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Regional Office 377.

2.	Nature and/or Description of Action: Notice of Other Than Full and Open competition for the procurement of Chapter 36 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Chapter 36 Education and Vocational Services having an estimated value of $294,650.

4.	Statutory Authority: The services are being procured under the authority of 38 U.S.C 8127(c), FAR 6.302-5 and VAAR 819.7007. 38 U.S.C. 8127(c) expressly authorizes the use of noncompetitive procedures for small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities.

5.	Demonstration of contractor unique qualifications: The requested interim Chapter 36 Education and Vocational Services are to meet the immediate needs of returning veterans until a new national services contract can be procured. An SDVOSB with experience and acceptable performance from the prior national contract is best suited to meet the need based on having approved personnel in place, and familiarity with current contract requirements.

6.	Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including notice publication:  See 4. and 5. above.  A proposed contract action will be synopsized at www.fbo.gov in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.	Fair and reasonable price determination: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using recent history of price for this type of service and comparison with the independent government estimate.  

8.	Market research: Market research was developed to support the independent government estimate. Data is also available from the recently completed national contract for the same services, which was competitively procured.

9.	Other facts: None.

10.	A listing of sources expressing an interest in writing: VR&E Service for Veterans, LLC.

11.	Statement of action for barriers to competition: None.

12.	Contracting Officer certification: I hereby certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
