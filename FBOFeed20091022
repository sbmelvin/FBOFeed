The Government anticipates the award on or about December 31, 2009 of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee with Performance Incentives contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and five (5) Fixed-Price-Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF) production lot options. Production lots six (6) through eleven (11) will be sole-source, negotiated using certified cost and pricing data. Proposals are due 30 days after RFP release.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer previously identified.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only available to the contractor(s) who were awarded the contract(s) for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04R3-S-08-8800, HAZARDOUS FUELS RESTORATION II (HFR II) STEWARDSHIP, UMATILLA NATIONAL FOREST. The original solicitation was competitively advertised as a Commercial Items RFP. The Government intends to award multiple Delivery Orders from a single request for quotations.  This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto. 



The HFR II Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes ground-based logging, cable logging, and product transportation and slash treatment.  The issuance of these Delivery Orders require the contractor(s) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing or rearranging the existing fuel loading on the forest floor.  This will be accomplished on selected locations on the Umatilla National Forest. All biomass removed will remain the property of the US Government and be transported by service contractor to local processors. This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area. Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment. Target fuel loading objective is to have no more than 10-12 tons per acre left once the work is completed. Slash treatment where required will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash. 



This project requires removal of approximately 38,705 tons of non-saw material (merchantable woody biomass).



The resultant contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price, with requirements for biomass removal. 



If you have questions about this project please contact Gary Dillavou Contract Specialist at (541) 278-3841.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Background:
The USGS Biological Informatics Office (BIO), located in Reston Virginia and Denver Colorado, is seeking information and geospatial technologies support related to its implementation of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program.   The National Biological Information Infrastructure serves as an electronic gateway to biological data and information products maintained by federal, state, and local government agencies; non-government institutions; and private sector organization in the United States and around the world.  Technical support is required related to information technology development, database design and development, portal technologies, biodiversity data management, geospatial technologies design and development, representation of NBII technical capabilities and requirements within International biodiversity initiatives, and supporting project management requirements.   These areas are required to further the development and enhancements to the NBII over the next several years and support ongoing collaborations with other federal and non-federal organizations.   As the NBII has evolved over the past several years, these requirements for state-of-the-art on-site and off-site technical skills and support have been paramount to the implementation of the network.   
The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program was created in 1993 based on the recommendation of a special panel convened by the National Research Council to examine critical national biological resource issues.  The development of regional (focused on specific regional biodiversity data and information issues) and thematic nodes has been underway, in collaboration with partners from every sector of society, for the past three years.  A critical component to insuring the network is interoperable, operated in a cost effective manner, and proper technical leadership exists is to insure that the NBII Program Office, BIO has the adequate and high-skilled technology support to lead the implementation of the NBII.  The NBII Program Office and the USGS Center for Biological Informatics (CBI), located in Denver Colorado, are responsible for overall tool development, biodiversity data management policies and practices, technical leadership for cost-cutting NBII Node Working Groups (i.e. Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies), and representing the NBII on several International biodiversity technical initiatives.
Basic Requirement: 
The scope of this effort is very broad in terms of encompassing both information and geospatial technologies requirements, but also biological sciences expertise.    Furthermore, the scope also requires that support be provided to NBII domestic efforts along with international efforts.   Several objectives of this support are briefly described below.
Design, development, and implement state-of-the-art technical tools, databases, and applications that support the NBII Programs and collaborators (i.e. FRAMES) overall mission and objectives.
Continue to be seen as a technical leader within the bioinformatics domain by U.S. and several international organizations through development of standards, innovative tools/applications, and expertise.
Develop the various databases, web applications, geospatial tools, and other activities on-time, within scope, and meeting customer needs.
Important General Requirements:

<p>Due to limitations of the FedBizOpps website, the Government is unable to post both the Sources Sought and Pre-Solicitation Notices using the same Solicitation Number. Therefore, the Government is posting the Sources Sought Notice at Solicitation Number "E91378_CCCIIS", which will contain only the Sources Sought Notice and all modifications thereto. The Pre-Solicitation Notice, Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP), if applicable, Request for Proposal and any additional updates will be posted to a Solicitation Number to be determined at a later date. All prospective offerors are instructed to continue to routinely monitor and register under Solicitation Number E91378_CCCIIS. At the time of the posting of the Pre-solicitation Notice, this Sources Sought Notice will be modified to identify the Pre-Solicitation number.</p>
<p>Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome has a requirement to provide life cycle software development and engineering support for the CCCIIS program. The CCCIIS program includes, but not limited to, the following messaging systems; Message Information Services and Tools for the IC (MISTIC), Communications Support Processor (CSP), the Tactical Communications Support Processor (TCSP), Secure Messaging and Routing Terminal neXt generation (SMART.neXt) and Infrastructure Operations Tools Access (IOTA). An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. We anticipate approximately $49,900,000 to be a sufficient ordering amount for the 60 month period of performance.</p>
<p>Capable sources are sought to focus on enabling the Air Force mission to maintain and improve DoD Intelligence capabilities for the AFRL/RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome).</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to provide systems engineering analysis, technical enhancements, system sustainment, system installation, and on-site engineering support for the U.S. Intelligence Community including the Air Force, Defense Intelligence Agency, Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units, and other members of U.S. Intelligence Community. Technical activities will include, but not be limited to: analytical studies, system feasibility studies, requirements definition/analysis, design, development, implementation, demonstration, systems engineering, integration, installation, site support, configuration management, quality control, training, integration/interoperability/security testing, security engineering, engineering support, and the generation of technical documentation detailing the above activities. In the course of performance, the Contractor will interface with various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide via short term visits and electronic means. On-site support is currently required in Colorado Springs, CO, Hampton VA, Robins AFB, Marietta GA, and AFRL Rome Research Site to provide analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of DODIIS Information Technology (IT) and to U.S. C4ISR Community systems and activities.</p>
<p>All information generated or maintained under this effort is export controlled. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Project Engineer, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office. Under the current contract, the work requires a SECRET facility clearance and approximately 50 personnel with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. Based on current estimates, approximately 30 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance at time of award. An additional 20 cleared personnel is estimated to be required within the first 45 - 60 days.</p>

<DESC>United States Air Force Academy Soaring ProgramIndustry Day Announcement
The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting analyses in support of the non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  As part of these analyses, ASC will be offering an Industry Day on 3 Nov 2009 near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn, Ohio at the Tec Edge, Wright Brothers Institute Innovation and Collaboration Center (ICC)(reference map attached in FedBizOps).  The purpose of this event is to communicate with industry the intentions of the potential USAFA glider acquisition, discuss minimum system requirements and receive contractor feedback on these topics.  This Industry Day shall be considered a portion of the market analysis being conducted by ASC.
This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft suitable for cadet soaring training; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders.  To be considered eligible, all aircraft proposed must be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FAA certified aircraft.  Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements.  Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.  Support of these aircraft will be handled under a separate contract and is not part of this effort.
The minimum characteristics of these aircraft are listed in Attachment 1 to this announcement.  Additional reference information can be found in the USAFA Sailplane Fleet Replacement Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) / Capability Request For Information (CRFI) posted 10 July 2009 to the FedBizOps site, however information contained therein should be considered for reference only and may have been subjected to change without notice.

ATTACHMENT 1 TO USAFA GLIDER INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
1.0	MINIMUM AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS:   Aircraft must meet all of the minimum characteristics/measurable capabilities listed below.
1.1 	Dual Seat Basic Training Glider (14 each).  FAA certification is mandatory.  Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory.  Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory.  Must be spin certified.  All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.
1.2	Dual Seat Aerobatic Training Glider (5 each).  FAA certification is mandatory.  Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory.  Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory.  Must be spin certified.  All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.  
1.3	System Performance.  All missions will be accomplished in day, Visual Meteorological Conditions with up to reported continuous moderate turbulence.  Aerobatics and spin training sorties may be limited to reported light to occasional moderate turbulence.  Minimum turn time between glider sorties may not exceed 5 minutes.  
1.4	Logistics and Readiness.  The fleet should be able to meet a 75% fully mission capable rate on any given day (Contract Logistics Support requirement).  It should be possible to complete aircraft annual inspections within three man-days, 100-hour or phased inspections within two man-days.
1.5	Maintenance Planning.  All maintenance and logistics support must fall under the existing Contract Logistics Support (CLS), USAFA airfield maintenance and fuel contracts.  No other programmed support, i.e. depot level maintenance, or Air Force organic maintenance, can be required.  For the lifetime of the incoming system it is anticipated that commercial contractors will provide maintenance support.  Maintenance schedules must be supplied by the manufacturer and in accordance with FAA certification guidelines.  Additionally, 100 hour or phased inspections are desired.  The aircraft manufacturer must be capable of providing complete logistics support including spare parts, engineering services and engineering data (in English) throughout the expected service life.
1.6	Support Equipment.  Trailers should be available as standard support equipment for gliders.  Aircraft must be deployable in trailers towed by  ton trucks with standard US ball hitches.  All glider maintenance should be accomplished with use of common support equipment (inclusive of hand tools) and provided in sufficient quantities to support all glider maintenance.  Development of peculiar support equipment shall be scrutinized and held to an absolute minimum.
1.7	C4I & Other Standardization, Interoperability, and Commonality.  Two-way VHF radios with a frequency range of 118.00 to 136.975 MHz selectable in 25 kHz intervals are required.  Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions and are required to be 406 MHz compliant.  Transponders (IFFs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions.
1.8	Computer Resources.  The glider must be equipped with a flight data recorder capable of interfacing with an existing Personal Computer (PC) based system that has the ability to track and maintain a database of aircraft flying hours for maintenance contract billing purposes.  Existing computer capabilities (inclusive of facilities, hardware, software and support) are sufficient to support all requirements of the new gliders procured under the Soaring Program.  No new or additional computer resources will be required.
1.9	Human Systems Integration
1.9.1	Gliders must be operable by non-rated Air Force personnel who meet the minimal medical screening requirements for incentive flights.  A 440-pound minimum useful load is required.  A useful load of 440-pounds allows a nominal 180-pound instructor to fly with a student as heavy as 260 pounds.
1.10	Other Logistics and Facilities Considerations.  All aircraft will be based at the USAF Academy and housed in existing hangars.  Current facilities, supplied and supported by the USAF, house the existing glider fleet and are sufficient to house the new fleet.  No new infrastructure is required.  The maintenance contractor will use existing or developed FAA-approved maintenance manuals.  The maintenance contractor with direct consultation of the manufacturer will accomplish any requirement for specialized maintenance training.  Maintenance support of the gliders will be accomplished by licensed A&P mechanics (released to fly after annuals by A&Ps with Inspector Authorization.)  No specialized maintenance technical orders can be required.  No new military occupational specialties can be required.  All aircrew training will be organic to the 306th Flying Training Group.  Trailers should be weather resistant and capable of outside storage in Colorado with no significant corr! osion or maintenance support.
1.11	Geospatial Information and Services.  Sectional Aeronautical Charts meet all cartographic requirements.
1.12	Natural Environmental Support.  State-of-the-science weather support is required to optimize mission effectiveness while minimizing risk to resources and personnel.  All airfield weather observation, forecasting, and aircrew briefing requirements are met by the current USAFA Airfield Contract weather support.  A contract will be in effect throughout the projected lifetime of the new aircraft and is a cost-effective way to satisfy the environmental support requirements.
1.13	Seat design should be flexible enough to allow pilots to fly with or without parachutes, as applicable, and still be able to operate flight controls.SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND CHARACTERISTICS PARAMETERS MATRIX

<DESC>1.0 Summary
<p>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) is conducting field bio assay and operational tests on two component lures to be used as a synthetic food attractants for the Mexican fruit flies.</p>
<p>The dispensers shall be a 2-component type containing ammonium acetate and putrescine.</p>
<p>The dispensers are utilized in various Fruit Fly Trapping programs. Dispensers should be constructed in a fashion that is conducive to outside conditions. The dispensers should not leak liquids, deteriorate in the sunlight, or dissolve in wet or damp conditions.</p>
<p>The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible to use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc. Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Other than the above information there is no required design (presentation) for the lure.</p>
<p>2.0 Required submittals</p>
<p>Companies interested in submitting their lures for testing must sent 200 samples at NO COST to the Government to the following locations:</p>
<p>2.1 Contact Information</p>
<p>Two hundred (200) samples shall be delivered to the USDA-Center for Plant Health, Science, and Technology (CPHST) facility in Edinburg, Texas for both Field Bio-assay and Operational tests.</p>
<p>USDA PPQ CPHST PDDML <br />Attn: Hugh Conway<br />Bldg 6414, Moore Air Base<br />22675 N Moorefield Road<br />Edinburg, TX 78541</p>
<p>(PDDML = Pest Detection Diagnostics &amp; Mgmt Lab)</p>
<p><br />2.2 Evaluation of Field Bio Assay</p>
<p><br />The lures effectiveness in attracting Mexican fruit flies (Anastrepha ludens) will be evaluated at: 1 day, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks against a Mcphail Trap freshly baited with Torula yeast pellets.</p>
<p>Any lure that does meet the minimum standard below would not be considered acceptable for program needs.</p>
<p>Less than 50% capture after 24 hours - unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 6 weeks - satisfactory<br />Less than 50% capture after 6 weeks -- unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 8 weeks -- Excellent</p>
<p>2.3 Evaluation of Operational Test</p>
<p>The samples will be placed in traps in the field to see how the lure products withstand Texas's weather conditions. The process will be run simultaneously with the Bioassay test. The handling procedures are important to prevent the loss of lure and to eliminate lure contamination of the trap. The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible with use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Problems observed in previous operational field tests include lure precuts melting, difficulty removing the lure from the trap bait well, and lures falling from the central clip.<br /><br />3.0 Completion of Testing</p>
<p>At the end of the testing a report will be given to all companies who submitted samples detailing the results for their product.</p>

SUPERVISION:
The Senior Advisor will receive general guidance from the NAS Director or Acting Director.  As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the incumbent will receive only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives.  Specific assignments frequently originate out of the liaison activities of the work, and the incumbent independently negotiates the draft scope and objectives of projects with little input or review by his/her supervisor.  Since the incumbent is physically located in La Paz, he/she will exercise considerable independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches in analyzing and reviewing NASs programs in Bolivia.

SUPERVISION EXERCISED:  None

GUIDELINES:

Guidelines include basic legislation, in particular Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as well as other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.  In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history.

The incumbent is recognized as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.

COMPLEXITY:
The work involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity.  Due to the high visibility and political sensitivity related to the issues that INL and NAS are involved with, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken.  Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues.  Also, in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions. 

SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS:
The Senior Advisor performs very broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full range of counternarcotics programs in Bolivia, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.  

8.  PERSONAL CONTACTS:
The incumbent works closely with the senior management of the NAS and the INL Bureau, and with senior managers in other agencies.  He/she may also have dealings with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the Department, as well as Congressional staffs.

H. Experience working counternarcotics and law enforcement issues within the Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Drug Enforcement Agency, or other USG Agency.  

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:
A.  The skill to plan, organize, and direct working groups and to negotiate effectively with management to accept and implement recommendations where the proposals involve substantial agency resources.  This requires the ability to coordinate the work of technical specialists, and resolve major conflicts in policy and program objectives, as they occur.

<DESC>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria<BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program, both Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is Dec 2009. Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), ARCIC, is continuing its Technology Information Exchange (TIE) program. One aspect of this program is to establish dialogue with industry on corporate/company Independent Research and Development projects relating to identified Army Force Operating Capabilities (FOCs). This program brings industry/corporate/company representatives together with the TRADOC ARCIC for a dialogue session on emerging technologies and desired Army force capabilities. Each TIE session is a distinct and separate presentation intended to facilitate a discussion between industry and the ARCIC at the executive level on a companys independent research and development projects. A General Officer or equivalent from the ARCIC will host each session and the intent is to provide input to help industry focus their R&D programs (without any financial reimbursement) towards existing and future Army capabilities, to the benefit of both industry and the U.S. Army. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION but is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(b).  TRADOC, ARCIC will use the responses to the RFI to determine what emerging technologies may be available in the market place. RFIs are used to gather information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement. This is not a request for contractual offers and information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract. Respondents to this RFI will not be reimbursed for the information they provide to the ARCIC. This is not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research but is a request for information from companies already conducting independent research and development in relevant areas. Only those companies with demonstrated success in their independent R&D programs to address Department of Defense warfighting capabilities are requested to respond. TRADOC Pamphlet 525-66 is the base document that describes the war fighting objective capabilities that the Army desires in its current to future force. The capability areas are: Strategic Responsiveness and Deployability, Battle Command, Battlespace Awareness, Mounted/Dismounted Maneuver, Air Maneuver, Line of Sight/Beyond Line of Sight (LOS/BLOS), Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) Lethality for Mounted/Dismounted Operations,  Maneuver Support, Protection, Maneuver Sustainment, Training, Leader Development & Education, and Human Dimension. A detailed description of each Force Operating Capability can be obtained by accessing the TRADOC Web site using the following instructions: <BR>1. Go to http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pamndx.htm <BR><BR>2. Once the page opens scroll down to 525-66 and CLICK on the PDF or DOC button on the right to download. Additional information may be available after coordination with the TIE coordinator (listed below) and verification of an active Industrial Security Program with the USG. When responding to this Request For Information provide a brief description and depth of the company independent R&D program, a brief description (one page) of past R&D success satisfying DOD capability needs, a brief description (one to two pages) on each of the R&D programs/projects that apply directly to Army Force Operating Capabilities, and points of contact list for further coordination if necessary. Based on the information provided, your company may be selected to participate in a Technology Information Exchange hosted by the ARCIC to address specific issues within your independent R&D program.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends on utilizing an existing Single Award BPA for GCDB and Land Records Services contract to procure services for Montana and the Dakotas Master Title Plat (MTP) Production.  The BPA being utilized is L07PD04989, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   This opportunity is only available to the current contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contractor.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541370 and Product Service Code D315.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.  Below is a general description of the services required.
This procurement involves the conversion of 1564 Montana and Dakotas Master Title Plats (which fall in potential renewable energy areas) to an Auto CAD compatible *.dwg file.  The conversion of a townships mylar plat will involve the compilation or editing of an existing raw drawing file in AutoCAD software to match the current, official set of mylar plats.  Match is defined to mean that the drawing file has been edited to portray the same information that is shown on each mylar copy.
Utilizing the most current GCDB data set, the PLSS is to be portrayed geographically on the MTP with all land status, lines, text and layers being converted to an electronic drawing file.  Utilizing BLMs LR2000, all recorded land status information will be populated to the MTP drawing file at a predetermined geographic location.  All lines and text will be converted to the correct drawing layer as defined by BLMs 1275 Manual Standards for Land Status Records.  A 100 percent inspection and one-to-one comparison will be performed with the BLM provided scanned image of the original (mylar) MTP and the newly converted MTP for a Quality Control/Quality Assurance check.  Any errors or omissions will be reported in a formal document to ensure that the LR2000 data or the MTP data is revised or corrected to current status.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer identifier Rules
<SOLNBR>CMS-RFI-100177a
<RESPDATE>111609
<ARCHDATE>11172009
<CONTACT>Denise Buenning , Email OESSRFI@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information:<br /></strong>Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer Identifier Rules</p>
<p>Summary: Six years have elapsed since the first effective date of mandatory compliance under the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). While the total number of complaints related to Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier, and Unique Identifier is small in comparison to the size of the industry; some industry representatives believe that the extent of non-compliance is higher than the figures represented in CMS' complaint statistics. In advance of the January 1, 2012 compliance date for the updated X12 version 5010, and NCPDP Version D.0, and 3.0 standards, and the October 1, 2013 compliance deadline for ICD-10 code sets as set forth in the final rules published on January 16, 2009, it is important for CMS to ensure that the industry is in compliance with the current versions of the transactions and code sets. Thus, we are proactively looking at options to improve and enhance the current enforcement process. We have prepared this Request for Information (RFI) to secure industry input on specific topics to help us to refine future strategies for the HIPAA enforcement process. <br />Background for HIPAA Regulations: The final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standards for Electronic Transactions (TCS), was published on August 17, 2000, and the subsequent Modifications to the HIPAA Electronic Transaction Standards rules were published on February 20, 2003 and January 16, 2009 (final rules). These rules require covered entities (CEs) (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers) to implement standards and code sets for certain electronic transactions, including: health care claims/encounters; health care payment and remittance advice; coordination of benefits (COB); eligibility inquiry and response; health care claim status and response; enrollment and dis-enrollment in a health plan; referral certification and authorization inquiry and response; and health plan premium payments.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2002, the final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standard Unique Employer Identifier was published and it became effective in July 2002. The rule adopted the Employer Identification Number (EIN) as the standard unique employer identifier and requires CEs to use the EIN in all standard transactions that require an employer identifier to identify a person or entity as an employer. On January 23, 2004, the HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Standard Unique Health Identifier for Health Care Providers final rule was published. It became effective in May 2005, and compliance was required by May 23, 2008. It adopted the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard identifier for all covered health care providers, and requires all CEs to use (send and receive) this identifier in standard transactions.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2006, HHS published the final Enforcement Rule governing the investigation of noncompliance with the HIPAA regulations, and made such investigations and penalties applicable to all of the Administrative Simplification rules, rather than exclusively to the HIPAA privacy standards. <br /><br />Enforcement strategy to date: Enforcement of the HIPAA rules is complaint driven. CMS receives complaints from the public, other government agencies, and covered entities. Each complaint is investigated, typically through a request for additional information or documentation from the complainant, as well as documentation, proof of compliance or a corrective action plan from the filed against entity (FAE). The results of each investigation have often resulted in contract changes, and/or modification to trading partner agreements, procedures or technologies, as appropriate. In some cases, following an entity's immediate steps to mitigate a particular issue, that entity finds other vulnerabilities or procedural issues which are also rectified. In some cases a longer term corrective action plan is developed and is monitored by CMS over an agreed upon period of time.</p>
<p>The 2006 Enforcement Rule also gave CMS the authority to conduct compliance reviews, and in 2007, CMS invoked that authority with respect to the Security Rule. Eleven comprehensive compliance reviews of assorted covered entity types have been conducted to date. Based on the findings, CMS has provided technical assistance and guidance to each of the covered entities.</p>
<p>Prevalence of TCS and Unique Identifier complaints: We have received over 600 TCS complaints since 2005, and 43 NPI complaints since 2008 (but no complaints related to the EIN). We are not certain if these complaints are truly representative of industry's compliance challenges, particularly since more than half of the complaints dealt with the issue of negotiating very specific trading partner agreements. Therefore, additional information about the HIPAA compliance environment could be invaluable in helping CMS better understand the scope of non-compliance issues to better target our approach to both outreach and enforcement.</p>
<p>Nature of current complaints: Though the CMS complaint volume is small, the nature of the allegations we have received lead us to believe that there may still be some challenges with respect to effective implementation of the rules, in spite of the time that has passed since the mandatory compliance date. Examples of some of the complaints we continue to receive are: <br />&bull; Failure to implement the full suite of transactions (e.g. COB, eligibility, referrals and authorizations); <br />&bull; Non-compliance with format or content requirements from the Implementation Guides; <br />&bull; Use of companion guides with requirements that conflict with implementation guides;<br />&bull; Code sets and/or code set rule violations - non-compliant use or non-compliant instructions for uses; <br />&bull; Continued use of legacy provider numbers;<br />&bull; Excessive fees charged by clearinghouses.</p>
<p>We hope that the feedback from this RFI will help us determine if the complaints about compliance are a result of ongoing technical issues with X12 4010 or NCPDP 5.1, or if they are the result of other organizational operational challenges.</p>
<p>Possible barriers to complaints: We understand that some providers have alleged that they would not file a complaint against a health plan for rejecting a compliant transaction, because they fear the health plan will slow or reduce their payment rates, or take other harmful actions. We do not have evidence of such, but would be interested in hearing from the industry if there have in fact been instances of retaliation for such communication. We recognize that some complainants wish to remain anonymous. While there are times when this can be accommodated, there are certain situations in which anonymity is a barrier to resolution, since the name of the affected entity and a sample transaction can assist in researching the complaint. We would like to solicit input on alternative complaint filing processes to create a more conducive environment for complainants.</p>
<p>Future enforcement strategy: Based on the substantive findings of the Security compliance reviews, CMS believes there could be similar benefits from reviews to assess compliance with the requirements of the Transactions, Code Sets and Unique Identifier rules. Possible benefits might include an increase in the use of certain transactions, a decreased reliance on companion guides, and/or an increase in efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p>We believe that a compliance review program would help us to understand and target the major contributing factors to non-compliance. Such information could be instructive in identifying issues related to standards development, implementation planning and execution for future versions of the standards. It could also identify educational gaps, program opportunities and outreach activities for Medicare, Medicaid, and the private sector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are soliciting input from the industry to help us to fine-tune the current complaint-driven enforcement process. We are requesting industry input and insight on possible improvements to the current enforcement process as well as the usefulness and structure of a compliance review program.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS
 OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GSA SCHEDULE 70, SPECIAL ITEM NUMBER 132-51. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES 


The Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), intends to issue a Request For Quote (RFQ) #GSCTFMG10-32214 to award a single award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program. It is anticipated that some of the task orders issued under this BPA will utilize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding. The Government anticipates awarding the BPA with a base period of 1 year, with 6 one year optional periods, and an estimated value of $100,000,000. The Prime Contractor must possess an IT Schedule 70 contract, SIN 132-51. The USDA requires an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) capability to support the full Information Technology (IT) lifecycle plus governance of its IT application and infrastructure solutions. USDA also requires IV&V) support to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other initiatives. These include the Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS), Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI), Budget and Performance Management System (BPMS), and Web Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) initiatives. These initiatives will be implemented using SAP AGs Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP), which the Department has mandated for ERP implementations. Over the course of the proposed 7 year BPA, it would expected that a large number of  task orders will be issued, each with significant variations in effort, complexity, length of time, and costs. IV&V work is inherently dependent upon the extent, quality, and timing of the work accomplished by a party separate from the IV&V contractor (ie. Government or Development Contractor). Due to this dependency, unless the underlying effort is rather limited in scope and duration, it is anticipated that a large number of IV&V projects will involve a sufficient degree of uncertainty and complexity such that firm requirements would not be able to be defined upfront to allow for a FFP order. In order for this BPA to accommodate all potential situations and be a viable contractual vehicle for the USDA, it must be flexible enough during the proposed 7 year period to allow for the issuance of T&M task orders as deemed necessary. 

It is anticipated that the RFQ will be posted to eBuy under IT Schedule 70, SIN 132-51 on or about Friday, October 30, 2009.   This notice does not obligate the Government to issue or award the BPA.   It is provided for information purposes only.

<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

The Period of Performance for this work is from October 8, 2009 to September 28, 2011. This work will require the contractor to continue the site assessment work at the Laguna Pueblos contaminated LUST sites, such as water sampling of existing monitoring wells, and develop a risk-based decision-making document.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDER. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</strong></span></p>

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL OR FAX. OBJECTIVE: The Air Force Health Facilities Division is responsible for the programming, planning, design, construction, and initial outfitting of new and renovated USAF medical treatment facilities worldwide. They are chartered with modernizing hospitals, clinics, medical office buildings, warehouses, vet clinics and wellness centers. To meet the IO requirements, the AFMS/HFD requires a contracting vehicle that utilizes experienced suppliers/vendors who are able to rapidly respond to multiple requirements, meet constrained project schedules and provide a variety of products and IO services from planning through warranty. This contract vehicle will enable the Air Force to standardize execution, minimize acquisition leadtimes and costs, work multiple projects concurrently and complete projects on schedule. Under this contract, the IO contractor shall provide 1) initial outfitting transition (IO-T) services associated with a military construction project and/or 2) provide all initial outfitting (IO) commodities to outfit new or newly renovated medical facilities with some or all of the following items:<BR>Resource protection / security systems<BR>Information technology (except computer equipment, printers, faxes, and other off-the-shelf items)<BR>Medical equipment and clinical casegoods<BR>Furniture and furnishings<BR>Art work<BR>Communication systems<BR>Signage <BR><BR>Task orders will be performed in two steps. Step 1 shall be Initial Outfitting Transition (IO-T), including project management, transition/relocation planning, planning/design and technical support, product selection/planning, inventory identification, storage, movers, supervision, and budget development, tracking and adherence. Step 2 includes procurement of the product, installation labor, transportation, tools, materials, storage and freight, casegoods, furniture and furnishings equipment, artwork, signage, information technology/communication and resource protection systems. Then contract will also include the move, reconfiguration, teardown, salvage, and/or disposal of existing products and inventory storage and installation of reusable systems furniture.<BR><BR>The objective is to have a contractor provide turn-key services to provide interior design, medical equipment, furniture, casegoods, communication equipment, information technology hardware and software, and furnishings for MTFs world-wide. These services must include cradle to grave project management services, design services, procurement of furniture and medical/clinical casegoods, warehousing capabilities, delivery, installation, inventory, warranty services, commissioning and training on all new equipment/furniture. The following are questions/concerns of the Government: (1) The contract should be world-wide with no division between U.S. regions and overseas. (2) The Government would like to have the flexibility to include furniture layout design services if we need them as we will not always be able to provide a Comprehensive Interior Design (CID). (3) The Government would like to have the option to reconfigure, restore or replace existing furniture components. The selected contractor will assist in assessing the condition and reusability of the existing furnishings. (4) The Government would want the ability to trade-in existing furniture for credit. (5) Vendors would be responsible for providing training on all new equipment. (6) The Government would like industry input as to the best way to make this turn-key operation work. (7) The Government would like industry to suggest ways to issue a single task order for a mix of furniture without running up against the barrier of dealer-exclusive relationships.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<p>Wide Area Workflow is the Dept. of the Air Force's mandatory method of electronic invoicing. More information can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil and in the addendum below.</p>
<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

<DESC>This request for proposal (RFP) outlines VISN 3s requirements for the Contractor to furnish and install an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Clinical Information Systems (CIS).  VISN 3 currently has two existing CIS.  At all VISN sites, a combination of traditional paper charting and VistA is being used to manage the ICU and surgery patients. All sites extensively and predominantly utilize Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and VHA Barcode Medication Administration System (BCMA) for all health care documentation.  Other software for the care of our patients includes VistA Imaging, Clinical Note Templates, and Health Promotion. Other CPRS- VistA programs are likely to be developed in the future and therefore the complete management system to be installed herein must have the flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of the VISN. Monitored vital sign and other electronic monitored information will be transferred automatically to the CIS flowsheet and displayed on a timeline correlated with all provided therapies. Device drivers to all VA medical devices for patient use must be capable of accepting all data, measured and calculated.  It is imperative that the new CIS, and the CPRS, BCMA and all other systems co-exist as seamlessly as possible on the same workstation.VISN 3 is procuring this ICU CIS license and associated interface licenses for its clinical staff (nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, etc.) to assist them in providing clinical care to patients by acquiring real time data from physiologic monitors, infusion pumps, ventilators and other equipment used to monitor and treat patients in the critical care setting.  The CIS will be used in critical care areas, including MICU, SICU, ER, PACU.  This contract is for a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferrable license for an unlimited number of concurrent users in a networked environment at the identified sites.

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. <br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan. By submission of its offer, the offeror certifies that the offeror does not conduct any restricted business operations in Sudan. <br />(n) Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations. <br />(1) Relation to Internal Revenue Code. A foreign entity that is treated as an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874 (or would be except that the inversion transactions were completed on or before March 4, 2003), is also an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of 6 U.S.C. 395 and for this solicitation provision (see FAR 9.108). <br />(2) Representation. By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one. <br />(End of provision) <br />Alternate I (Apr 2002). As prescribed in 12.301(b)(2), add the following paragraph (c)(11) to the basic provision: <br />(11) (Complete if the offeror has represented itself as disadvantaged</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45383 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.  This is a small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 336611.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half Street, S.W. (JR11-0203) <br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 10 AM Eastern Time on 16, Nov. 2009.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>United States Air Force Academy Soaring ProgramIndustry Day Announcement
The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting analyses in support of the non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  As part of these analyses, ASC will be offering an Industry Day on 3 Nov 2009 near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn, Ohio at the Tec Edge, Wright Brothers Institute Innovation and Collaboration Center (ICC)(reference map attached in FedBizOps).  The purpose of this event is to communicate with industry the intentions of the potential USAFA glider acquisition, discuss minimum system requirements and receive contractor feedback on these topics.  This Industry Day shall be considered a portion of the market analysis being conducted by ASC.
This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft suitable for cadet soaring training; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders.  To be considered eligible, all aircraft proposed must be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FAA certified aircraft.  Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements.  Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.  Support of these aircraft will be handled under a separate contract and is not part of this effort.
The minimum characteristics of these aircraft are listed in Attachment 1 to this announcement.  Additional reference information can be found in the USAFA Sailplane Fleet Replacement Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) / Capability Request For Information (CRFI) posted 10 July 2009 to the FedBizOps site, however information contained therein should be considered for reference only and may have been subjected to change without notice.

ATTACHMENT 1 TO USAFA GLIDER INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
1.0	MINIMUM AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS:   Aircraft must meet all of the minimum characteristics/measurable capabilities listed below.
1.1 	Dual Seat Basic Training Glider (14 each).  FAA certification is mandatory.  Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory.  Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory.  Must be spin certified.  All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.
1.2	Dual Seat Aerobatic Training Glider (5 each).  FAA certification is mandatory.  Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory.  Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory.  Must be spin certified.  All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.  
1.3	System Performance.  All missions will be accomplished in day, Visual Meteorological Conditions with up to reported continuous moderate turbulence.  Aerobatics and spin training sorties may be limited to reported light to occasional moderate turbulence.  Minimum turn time between glider sorties may not exceed 5 minutes.  
1.4	Logistics and Readiness.  The fleet should be able to meet a 75% fully mission capable rate on any given day (Contract Logistics Support requirement).  It should be possible to complete aircraft annual inspections within three man-days, 100-hour or phased inspections within two man-days.
1.5	Maintenance Planning.  All maintenance and logistics support must fall under the existing Contract Logistics Support (CLS), USAFA airfield maintenance and fuel contracts.  No other programmed support, i.e. depot level maintenance, or Air Force organic maintenance, can be required.  For the lifetime of the incoming system it is anticipated that commercial contractors will provide maintenance support.  Maintenance schedules must be supplied by the manufacturer and in accordance with FAA certification guidelines.  Additionally, 100 hour or phased inspections are desired.  The aircraft manufacturer must be capable of providing complete logistics support including spare parts, engineering services and engineering data (in English) throughout the expected service life.
1.6	Support Equipment.  Trailers should be available as standard support equipment for gliders.  Aircraft must be deployable in trailers towed by  ton trucks with standard US ball hitches.  All glider maintenance should be accomplished with use of common support equipment (inclusive of hand tools) and provided in sufficient quantities to support all glider maintenance.  Development of peculiar support equipment shall be scrutinized and held to an absolute minimum.
1.7	C4I & Other Standardization, Interoperability, and Commonality.  Two-way VHF radios with a frequency range of 118.00 to 136.975 MHz selectable in 25 kHz intervals are required.  Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions and are required to be 406 MHz compliant.  Transponders (IFFs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions.
1.8	Computer Resources.  The glider must be equipped with a flight data recorder capable of interfacing with an existing Personal Computer (PC) based system that has the ability to track and maintain a database of aircraft flying hours for maintenance contract billing purposes.  Existing computer capabilities (inclusive of facilities, hardware, software and support) are sufficient to support all requirements of the new gliders procured under the Soaring Program.  No new or additional computer resources will be required.
1.9	Human Systems Integration
1.9.1	Gliders must be operable by non-rated Air Force personnel who meet the minimal medical screening requirements for incentive flights.  A 440-pound minimum useful load is required.  A useful load of 440-pounds allows a nominal 180-pound instructor to fly with a student as heavy as 260 pounds.
1.10	Other Logistics and Facilities Considerations.  All aircraft will be based at the USAF Academy and housed in existing hangars.  Current facilities, supplied and supported by the USAF, house the existing glider fleet and are sufficient to house the new fleet.  No new infrastructure is required.  The maintenance contractor will use existing or developed FAA-approved maintenance manuals.  The maintenance contractor with direct consultation of the manufacturer will accomplish any requirement for specialized maintenance training.  Maintenance support of the gliders will be accomplished by licensed A&P mechanics (released to fly after annuals by A&Ps with Inspector Authorization.)  No specialized maintenance technical orders can be required.  No new military occupational specialties can be required.  All aircrew training will be organic to the 306th Flying Training Group.  Trailers should be weather resistant and capable of outside storage in Colorado with no significant corr! osion or maintenance support.
1.11	Geospatial Information and Services.  Sectional Aeronautical Charts meet all cartographic requirements.
1.12	Natural Environmental Support.  State-of-the-science weather support is required to optimize mission effectiveness while minimizing risk to resources and personnel.  All airfield weather observation, forecasting, and aircrew briefing requirements are met by the current USAFA Airfield Contract weather support.  A contract will be in effect throughout the projected lifetime of the new aircraft and is a cost-effective way to satisfy the environmental support requirements.
1.13	Seat design should be flexible enough to allow pilots to fly with or without parachutes, as applicable, and still be able to operate flight controls.SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND CHARACTERISTICS PARAMETERS MATRIX

<DESC>United States Air Force Academy Soaring ProgramIndustry Day Announcement
The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting analyses in support of the non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  As part of these analyses, ASC will be offering an Industry Day on 3 Nov 2009 near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn, Ohio at the Tec Edge, Wright Brothers Institute Innovation and Collaboration Center (ICC)(reference map attached in FedBizOps).  The purpose of this event is to communicate with industry the intentions of the potential USAFA glider acquisition, discuss minimum system requirements and receive contractor feedback on these topics.  This Industry Day shall be considered a portion of the market analysis being conducted by ASC.
This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft suitable for cadet soaring training; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders.  To be considered eligible, all aircraft proposed must be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FAA certified aircraft.  Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements.  Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.  Support of these aircraft will be handled under a separate contract and is not part of this effort.
Please view the PDF Industry Day Announcement for additional information.

<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>1.0 Summary
<p>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) is conducting field bio assay and operational tests on three component lures to be used as a synthetic food attractants for the female fruit fly.</p>
<p>The dispensers shall be a 3-component type containing ammonium acetate, trimethylamine, and putrescine.</p>
<p>The dispensers are utilized in various Fruit Fly Trapping programs. Dispensers should be constructed in a fashion that is conducive to outside conditions. The dispensers should not leak liquids, deteriorate in the sunlight, or dissolve in wet or damp conditions.</p>
<p>The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible to use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc. Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Other than the above information there is no required design (presentation) for the lure.</p>
<p>2.0 Required submittals</p>
<p>Companies interested in submitting their lures for testing must sent 200 samples at NO COST to the Government to the following locations:</p>
<p>2.1 Field Bio Assay</p>
<p>One hundred (100) samples shall be delivered to the Fruit Fly Genetics and Management Laboratory at Waimanalo, HI for an eight (8) week field bioassay test.&nbsp; The test will be run with the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitits capitata).&nbsp;</p>
<p>USDA APHIS PPQ CPHST<br />Attn: Todd Shelly<br />41-650 Ahiki St.<br />Waimanalo (Oahu), Hawaii 96795<br />Phone: (808) 259-8822</p>
<p>2.1.2 Evaluation of Bio Assay</p>
<p>The lures effectiveness in attracting flies will be evaluated at: 1 day, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks against a Mcphail Trap freshly baited with Torula yeast pellets. <br /><br />Any lure that does meet the minimum standard below would not be considered acceptable for program needs.</p>
<p>Less than 50% capture after 24 hours - unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 6 weeks - satisfactory<br />Less than 50% capture after 6 weeks -- unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 8 week -- Excellent</p>
<p>2.2 Operational Test (Type and Versatility) of Synthetic Food Three Component Lures (Dispensers):</p>
<p>One hundred (100) samples shall be delivered to the Florida Fruit Fly Detection Program for operational field testing:</p>
<p>USDA APHIS PPQ <br />Attn: Ed Cusano<br />915 10th Street East<br />Palmetto, FL 34221<br />Phone: (941) 722-7307<br /><br />The samples will be placed in traps in the field to see how the lure products withstand Florida's weather conditions. The process will be run simultaneously with the Bioassay test.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Evaluation of Operational Test</p>
<p>The handling procedures are important to prevent the loss of lure and to eliminate lure contamination of the trap. The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible with use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Problems observed in previous operational field tests include lure precuts melting, difficulty removing the lure from the trap bait well, and lures falling from the central clip.<br /><br />3.0 Completion of Testing</p>
<p>At the end of the testing a report will be given to all companies who submitted samples detailing the results for their product.</p>
<p>3.1 Desired outcome</p>
<p>The outcomes of this testing may result in a standardized lure design for three component fruit fly attractant.</p>
<p><br />4.0 Dates and other pertinent information</p>
<p>Sample lure packages must be marked with the company name and the solicitation number (AG-6395-S-10-0003).</p>
<p>Companies can submit multiple lure designs (presentations) but they must send 200 of each type.</p>
<p>Lures are due to the field locations by close of business on 01 December 2009</p>

<DESC>This presolicitation notice replaces the former presolicitation notice for R10PS34R05.  The purpose of the modification is to make editorial corrections.
The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for cleaning up the North Shore RV Park.  Trailers including slabs, washroom/restroom building, power distribution boxes, trailer power pedestals, hose spigots and above ground irrigation lines, light poles,, dying trees, rock and concrete landscaping, fencing and trash pickup.  There will be hazardous waste removal and disposal included in the work.  The sewer line at each pad/building will have to be plugged.  This project will be partially or wholly funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  Please be advised that the Awardee will be subject to Section 1512(c) of ARRA, which requires that each contractor report on its ARRA funds under the awarded contract.  These reports will be made available to the public. 
Project Description:  North Shore RV Park was a small recreation concession near Mecca, California, on the east shore of the Salton Sea.  It was operated by a succession of private lessees on lands leased from the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) since the 1960s.  At one time it included several dozen recreational camping spaces, a marina for sport fishing and boating, and other amenities.  As water based recreation use at the Salton Sea declined over the years, North Shore RV Park became increasingly less financially viable.
North Shore RV Park is located in the South West of Section 34, Township 7 South, Range 10 East, San Bernardino Meridian, California.
The existing facility and associated infrastructure has deteriorated to the point that it has become an attractive nuisance in addition to possible health and safety issues.  Although an effort has been made to limit access to the site, a number of the abandon trailers have been subject to vandalism.
In order to reduce government liability and in order to reduce the attractive nuisance the vacated trailers and buildings present, Reclamation is requiring that the trailers including slabs, washroom/restroom building, power distribution boxes, trailer power pedestals, hose spigots and above ground irrigation lines, light poles, dying trees, rock and concrete landscaping, fencing and trash pickup.  Included is hazardous waste removal and disposal noted in the HAZMAT report.  The sewer line at each pad/building will have to be plugged.
Due to the presence of asbestos, it will be necessary for the demolition work to include any required lead paint and asbestos abatement and disposal in accordance with the requirements of local, state, and federal governing entities including the necessary inspections and notifications. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M.
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin December 28, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of June 28, 2010. Bid Bond, Payment and Performance Bonds are required.
The magnitude of this construction project is estimated to be between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The anticipated period of performance is 180 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.  
The acquisition was offered to and accepted by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the 8(a) Program and will be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) firms within Region IX.  Therefore, invitation for bids will be extended to firms eligible for program participation located within the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada.  There will be a formal public bid opening.  This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the method outlined in FAR Part 14 - Sealed Bidding.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price construction type.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available only through Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about November 05, 2009.  A site visit/pre-proposal conference will be held on or about November 16, 2009.

<CONTACT>Princess Cannon, 202-493-4634

<a href="mailto:princess.cannon@faa.gov">princess.cannon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Due to unforeseen circumstances the Federal Aviation Administration hereby cancels Market Survey #8866, SWIM XML Gateway, in its entirety.  Should the requirement for a market survey be resurrected, another solicitation will be issued at a later date and will be posted on the FAA's Contract Opportunities web page.  It is any potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor the site for the release.
This Amendment incorporates NAICS code 334210 which was omitted on the original Market Survey.  Consequently, FAA has extended the response date for the Market Survey until October 23, 2009.
Background: The System Wide Information Management Program (SWIM) will use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles in designing and specifying NAS Air Traffic Management (ATM) services.  The FAA is seeking an XML Gateway that meets the Government's requirements to help ensure that the opportunities and benefits of SOA are achieved. 
Purpose:This is a market survey for the SWIM XML Gateway Qualified Vendor's List. This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested business concerns, including SBA certified 8(a) firms and other small business concerns, capable of providing standard, commercial XML Gateways which meets the Government's requirements. 
Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, and other small businesses such as Women Owned businesses and Service Disabled Veteran businesses or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. 
Requirements:In order to make the determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses the FAA requires a Capability Statement from interested vendors. The Capability Statement should address your firm's technical capability to provide the product and services described in the Requirements Document. Limited to four (4) pages, it should include the following:1.	A list of similar projects undertaken.  For each project cited, please provide the following information: Name of project, Contract number, Customer Name, Brief Description of project or services/XML Gateway product provided, start and end dates, and any other relevant information.2.	Expected programmatic approach, i.e., in-house, teaming, or subcontracting. If your organization is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, please provide the percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  3.	If applicable, a list of all teaming partners with a description of each partner's responsibility. 4.	Business Declaration Form (see attachment).5.	If applicable, Small Business or 8(a) certification letter.
To help you determine if your company is qualified to provide XML Gateway and services necessary for this requirement, the FAA is making available a DRAFT Requirements Document and Qualification Information Request (QIR). The Government welcomes substantive comments on both documents. Please submit comments together with the Capability Statement described above. There is no page limit on comments.  
Contact Information:The FAA prefers that all responses, questions, and/or comments, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address:  princess.cannon@faa.gov.  All responses to this market survey must be received no later than October 23, 2009, 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. 
Princess Cannon, Contract SpecialistEmail: princess.cannon@faa.govPhone: 202.493.4634
Follow-up Activity (if any):Note:  The final Requirements Document and QIR are expected to be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities Website on November 2, 2009 with a response date of November 23, 2009.

(4) Component means any item supplied to the Government as part of an end item or of another component.
(5) Electronic component means an item that operates by controlling the flow of electrons or other electrically charged particles in circuits, using interconnections of electrical devices such as resistors, inductors, capacitors, diodes, switches, transistors, or integrated circuits.
(6) End item means the final production product when assembled or completed, and ready for issue, delivery, or deployment.
(7) Produce means the application of forces or processes to a specialty metal to create desired physical properties through quenching or tempering of steel plate, or gas atomization or sputtering of titanium.
(8) Qualifying country means any country listed in subsection 225.872-1(a) or (b) of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
(9) Required form means in the form of mill product, such as bar, billet, wire, slab, plate or sheet, and in the grade appropriate for the production of
(i) A finished end item delivered to the Department of Defense; or
(ii) A finished component assembled into an end item delivered to the Department of Defense.
(10) Specialty metal means
(i) Steel
(A) With a maximum alloy content exceeding one or more of the following limits: manganese, 1.65 percent; silicon, 0.60 percent; or copper, 0.60 percent; or

(1) Electronic components;
(2) (i) Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items; other than
(A) COTS fasteners, unless such fasteners are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, assemblies, or components.
(B) Forgings or castings of specialty metals, unless such forgings or castings are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, or assemblies.
(C) Commercially available high performance magnets, unless such high performance magnets are incorporated into COTS end items or subsystems;
(ii) A COTS item is considered to be offered without modification as long as it is not modified prior to contractual acceptance by the next higher tier in the supply chain.
(A) Specialty metals contained in a COTS item that was accepted without modification by the next higher tier are excepted and remain excepted even if a piece of the COTS item subsequently is removed (e.g., the end is removed from a COTS screw or an extra hole is drilled in a COTS bracket).
(B) For specialty metals that were not contained in a COTS item upon acceptance, but are added to the COTS item after acceptance, the added specialty metals are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a special reinforced handle made of specialty metal that is added to a COTS item).
(C) If two or more COTS items are combined in such a way that the resultant item is not a COTS item, only the specialty metals involved in joining the COTS items together are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a COTS aircraft is outfitted with a COTS engine, but not a COTS engine normally provided with that aircraft.)
(D) For COTS items that are normally sold in the commercial marketplace with various options, items that include such options are also COTS items. However, if a COTS item is offered to the Government with an option that is not normally offered in the commercial marketplace, that option is subject to the specialty metals restrictions. (e.g., An aircraft is normally sold to the public with an option for several different radios. DoD requests a military-unique radio. The aircraft is still a COTS item, but the military-unique radio is not a COTS item, and must comply with the specialty metals restrictions, unless another excerption applies.)

(ii) A sufficient quantity; and
(iii) The required form.
(6) Specialty metals, other than specialty metals in high performance magnets, that do not meet any of the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this clause, if the total weight of such noncompliant metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of specialty metals in the item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor.

(c) (1) Streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles. As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, In the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause if
(i) This is an acquisition of commercial derivative military articles; and
(ii) The Contractor has certified in its offer in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
(2) Certification for streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles (to be submitted with offer when applicable). The offeror [  ] certifies  [  ] does not certify that prior to award it will have entered into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in the required form for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, that is not less than the Contractors good faith estimate of the greater of
(i) An amount equivalent to 120% of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article (including the work performed under each subcontract); or
(ii) An amount equivalent to 50% of the amount of specialty metal that is purchased by the contractor and its subcontractors for use during such period in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article.

If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(End of clause)

52.211-13     TIME EXTENSIONS (SEP 2000)

Time extensions for contract changes will depend upon the extent, if any, by which the changes cause delay in the completion of the various elements of construction. The change order granting the time extension may provide that the contract completion date will be extended only for those specific elements related to the changed work and that the remaining contract completion dates for all other portions of the work will not be altered. The change order also may provide an equitable readjustment of liquidated damages under the new completion schedule.

52.232-33  PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERCENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

		J.18. Based on the evaluation results, the proposal will be assigned one of five (5) confidence ratings.  The ratings and related definitions that will be used to define the confidence the Government has in the offerors ability to successfully perform the contract work.

		J.19. An offeror with no Past Performance may receive a rating based on the evaluation of its predecessor companies, key personnel, and/or subcontractors. These ratings may not have the same weight as the ratings of the proposing company.   If such information is not applicable (i.e., the offeror does not have a predecessor company, key personnel or subcontractors with relevant experience), the offeror shall be evaluated as "neutral. However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant Past Performance history, while rated Neutral in Past Performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. 

		J.20. In evaluating performance confidence, the Government may contact your references for additional information and to assure validity of the received questionnaires. The Government may contact sources other than those provided by the offeror for information with respect to past performance.

The proposal shall include a preliminary schedule showing critical milestones in the design, manufacture, and installation and testing of the provided test cell. 

		 
	J.27. Evaluation: Organization and Technical Approach -- The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and any deficiencies in the offerors proposal and understanding of the Dyno technical and functional requirements.  The evaluation will include the offerors capability to execute the project. Some additional specific evaluation considerations are listed below.  However, this list is not all-inclusive. 

	J.28. Organization:  The SSEB will evaluate the clarity and strength of the overall technical approach and how well the proposal defines the process they will utilize to execute the entire scope of work.  
	
	J.29. Processes during Design and Construction:  The SSEB will evaluation the realism of the preliminary schedule showing the critical milestones in the design, manufacture, installation and training proposed for the test cell.  The evaluation will include the prior experience of the Project Manager in delivery of similar Dyno projects.   
	
	J.30. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key Dyno test cell.  They will evaluate the proposal as to how each element of the Statement of Work was addressed in the proposal indicating understanding of the requirement and how they intended to satisfy the overall Dyno performance requirements.  The SSEB will evaluate the offerors warranty and specific exclusions in the one-year warranty.   

		J.31. The SSEB will evaluate the offerors quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  They will evaluate the offerors quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.

	J.32. Oral Presentation:  Upon receipt of all written proposals the SSEB shall schedule and interview all offerors determined to be within the competitive range. Oral presentation will not be scored or evaluated separately.   Oral presentations will normally be followed by a SSEB question and answer period for clarification purposes. The location for presentations will be provided with the presentation date and time assignment.  The purpose of the oral presentations is to provide the offeror with the opportunity to briefly explain any specific documentation provided, to highlight the special features of their proposal, and to identify the benefits of the offerors technical data proposal.  Any betterments or deviations that the offeror wishes the Government to consider should be discussed in detail in the oral presentation. The offeror is expected to highlight significant technical points contained in their proposal but will not be permitted to submit anything new, but may expand on anything contained in the proposal. Offerors are cautioned that all information provided, regardless of the format, i.e. written proposal, oral presentation, shall be considered as proposal information, and used in the evaluation process.
 
Section K - Evaluation Factors for Award

(See Section L for proposal submission and evaluation of selection factor) 
              K.1 Basis of Award:  The award shall be based on the evaluation of three factors: (1) Relevant Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings (shown below) will be provided for Relative Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach.    
	      K.2. Price:   The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offerors proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offerors understanding of the proposal requirements.  Price is not separately rated.

	a. The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. 

	b. Price evaluation will consider reasonableness and realistic prices associated with the offerors overall technical proposal solution.  Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost criteria may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines:  A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or the Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a)(1) and (4).  

	c. For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. 

	d. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.

	K.3. The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal the Source Selection Authority has determined conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and the offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all non-priced factors described herein, and price. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are considered approximately equal to price, however the contract award price shall not exceed $1,570,000.00.   The intent of this solicitation is to obtain the best proposal within the cost limitation. There is no obligation to approach or match the cost limitation in the offer.  After the Government individually evaluates and rates each proposal, the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority will compare the RFP requirements to determine which proposal represents the best value.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.  The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.0001.  If there is a lower priced conforming offer(s), the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Official must determine that the added value of more expensive proposal (within the cost limitation) would justify award to that offeror.  As part of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate betterments in proposals relative to the minimum standards of the RFP to determine if they offer additional value to the Government.      
      
	Organization and Technical Approach Ratings and Definitions: 

Excellent	Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Agency.  Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting government requirements.  
Good	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Agency.  Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the agencys requirements.  
Satisfactory	Proposal meets most of the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements. Advantages were offset by disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by offeror were acceptable.  Fair probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Agencys requirements.
Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal, but acceptable contract performance. Proposal would require major rewrites to make it acceptable. Probability of success is questionable without discussions with the offeror.     
Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations; there is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Agencys requirements. Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or resubmission.  Unacceptable risk, not awardable as proposed

 

             Relative Past Performance Confidence Ratings:   The following ratings and related definitions will be used to define the performance risk:

Very High Degree of Confidence	Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very high degree of confidence the contractor will meet or exceed the Government's requirements.  
High Confidence	Performance met contract requirements. Good quality. Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve where appropriate. Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant. Good probability of success with overall high degree of confidence in meeting the government's requirements.
Average Confidence	Performance met most contract requirements. Adequate quality. Problems were identified however; contractor usually took adequate corrective action. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  OR Although performance generally exceeds expectations and was generally rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. Fair probability of success with an average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements.
Below Average Confidence	Performance met some contract requirements. Fair quality. Problems were identified however; contractor sometimes took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant. Probability of success is unclear with an overall below average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements. 
Low Degree of Confidence	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature. Contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective. Performance was current and generally relevant to semi- relevant. Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably low degree of confidence the contractor will meet the governments requirements.  
Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment. Unknown

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THE RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, WHICH IS 15 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.	

The Blood Diseases and Resources Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking potential sources to perform as the central laboratory for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III). The applicable NAICS code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees. It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years. 
The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE CENTRAL LABORATORY ONLY
The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program. The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.
The domestic hubs and the international programs will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support.  The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory, which will be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  
The Central Laboratory of the REDS-III Program shall be responsible for: 1) providing technical laboratory expertise and serving as an active participant in developing and prioritizing all REDS-III domestic and international research activities; 2) proposing, developing, and conducting laboratory-based research studies; 3) performing infectious disease, genetic, molecular, immunological, hematological or other processing and testing of biospecimens from all domestic hubs and international sites participating in RED-III epidemiological and laboratory studies according to protocol; 4) arranging and managing subcontracts with other laboratory testing facilities, as appropriate; and 5) serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

<DESC>Introductory Paragraph<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this project is 541712. <br />
<p><br />Background<br />The mandate of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is to provide information about potentially toxic chemicals to regulatory and research agencies, and to strengthen the science base in toxicology. As part of NTP's effort to fulfill its mission, NTP, on an annual basis, selects approximately 10 new chemicals for testing, has 20-30 subchronic studies, has 30-40 chronic studies in different stages of testing and evaluation, and presents approximately 15 subchronic and chronic studies for public peer review. NTP also reviews an additional 30 reproductive, perinatal, multigenerational and developmental studies on a yearly basis. Studies are conducted in vitro, and subchronic and chronic studies are conducted in rodents. These studies are done predominantly at contractor laboratories which are monitored by NTP staff. This work is currently being conducted under the following three (3) contracts: N01-ES-55551 held by Battelle Memorial Institute, N01-ES-55552 held by Midwest Research Institute and N01-ES-65554 held by Research Triangle Institute.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this project is to provide Chemistry Support Services for the NTP. The objective of this project is to provide all of the chemistry support activities of the non-inhalation and non-aquatic toxicology laboratories for the NTP to include chemical procurement, characterization, and dose formulation services.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />Major tasks required include the following:<br />1) Procurement, including handling and shipment chemicals, test articles, and samples produced <br />in support of NTP activities.<br />2) Chemical characterization, including all activities related to establishing the identity and <br />determining the purity of a chemical, test article or sample, including developing methods needed to perform the analysis.<br />3) Dose Formulation, including all activities related to dose preparation, mixing, and analysis of <br />formulations containing a chemical, test article or sample in a variety of vehicles (e.g., corn oil, water, aqueous methylcellulose, feed, air, etc.), including developing and validating methods needed to perform the analyses.<br />4) Biosample Analysis, including all activities related to determination of the concentration of a <br />chemical, test article, sample or its metabolites in a variety of matrices (e.g., blood, plasma, liver, kidney, fat, commercial dietary supplements, filters, etc.), including developing and validating methods needed to perform the analyses.<br />5) Animal Studies, including all activities requiring administration of test article(s) to animals. <br />This includes activities related to determining the toxicokinetics of a chemical, test article or sample administered to an animal (usually rodents), and establishing the palatability of chemical formulations administered to an animal.<br />6) Special Chemical Analysis, includes all activities that are part of the overall scope of the <br />contract, but are not contained within a single functional area, or represent only a portion of a functional area. For example, a dose analysis assignment that includes a validation or a dose formulation development effort that includes a validation but not a stability study, are special chemical analyses.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations<br />This work requires the contractor to have or establish a materials handling facility capable of <br />safely processing and containing chemicals including suspect human carcinogens.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The purpose of this modification is to provide Questions & Answers received in response to the no-cost solicitation.  They are as follows:
How many case studies would you expect to be posted each month?  
The EPA would like to see at a minimum of 5 case studies for each of the following:  1)  New Buildings and Infrastructure; 2) Facilities Management; 3) Transportation Logistics/Supply Chain; 4)  Merchandising; and 5) Customer Programs and Services.
Are you looking for strictly retailers or also their suppliers?  
The focus would be on retailer case studies.
For the regulated media content, would this be structured links to regulated media resources?  
The regulated media task would include a structured set of links to regulated media resources currently included in the Retail Industry Portal; another navigation path to the existing information.  A regulated media path would help retail staff in charge of a particular media area (e.g., waste management, air emissions).

<DESC><p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about October 30, 2009 for an anticipated five-year Cost plus Fixed-Fee contract, for Mission-wide Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) services. The primary objective of the contract is the development of an M&amp;E activity to provide continued performance monitoring, verification and evaluation of the impact, output results and environmental compliance of the various USAID programs and activities as well as other programs and activities as required by USAID.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of the M&amp;E Activity will be to enable USAID/Colombia to meet management information needs in order to make informed management decisions, as well as to shape the longer-term strategic direction and decision-making. This M&amp;E activity will not replace the M&amp;E systems that other USAID partners use in their programs. Rather, it is intended to standardize, collect and disseminate the results (indicators) as a means to centralize and assess progress towards achieving USAID's Assistance Objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The M&amp;E program will provide activity-level monitoring and evaluation services designed to provide qualitative and/or quantitative analyses and reviews of specific Mission activities and programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of these M&amp;E services could include, but are not limited to: field verification exercises of the indicator results provided by USAID implementing partners, targeted activity-level 'impact audits' (showing the changes in the quality of live and/or standard of living of beneficiaries due to USAID program inputs), verification of activities' environmental compliance, generation of success stories, and/or rapid economic assessments of regions and localities. The USAID Clearinghouse is another component of this program and will serve as the USAID/Colombia country-wide reporting platform to all implementing partners. In addition, the USAID M&amp;E Program will be available to give guidance in the preparation of indicators, Performance Management Plans (PMPs) and other performance management tools for other USAID implementers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) -the U.S. Embassy's strategy developed in order to complement the Government of Colombia's National Consolidation Plan- the M&amp;E Program will be tasked to develop a USAID CSDI PMP, including common quantitative and qualitative measures to be collected at the CSDI regions, and to conduct an evaluation of the CSDI impact results at the level of the beneficiaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to these requirements and the need of this M&amp;E Program to conduct field surveys of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>beneficiaries, communities and local organizations, as well as random field verifications of the activities conducted by other USAID implementers, a close collaboration will be required between the implementers' M&amp;E systems and the overall USAID M&amp;E Program.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The proposed contract will focus on policy issues in coordination with the GOC that emanate from across Colombia, not just the CSDI regions. These issues could include, but not be limited to, Land Policy, Access to Financial Services, Policies Towards Conflict-affected Populations, Support for Decentralization and Improved Public and Economic Management, Labor Issues, and, Environmental Policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Implementer will provide technical assistance, training, invitational travel and pilot projects, as required by the GOC and agreed to by USAID, to help the GOC conceptualize and implement policies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These pilot projects could be mechanisms to assure that policies, will work as planned when more broadly implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The implementer will be responsible for developing an effective coordination mechanism to capture inputs and ideas from the field, other nationwide programs (such as human rights, access to justice, and attention to displaced persons), and specialized programs related to environment, implementation of programs for Afro-Colombians and indigenous, and other programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Research and analysis on key policy issues of importance for use by the sector itself, the GOC and/or the donor community will be important for promoting understanding and developing consensus around technically-sound policy solutions to priority issues. Dissemination of this research will form part of the program activities, to raise awareness and stimulate discussion on policy reform efforts within the GOC and with other stakeholders.</p>

<DESC>22 OCTOBER 2009:  CARES II on-site training at Scott AFB 17-18 Nov 2009 has been canceled. Tighter network security, diligent Information Assurance restrictions by the Surface Deployment Distribution Command (SDDC), although necessary, has made it cumbersome on both the government and interested carriers in obtaining access to the CARES II system. 

SDDC will be offering an interactive training CARES II SM Compact Disk (CD) which will be mailed to all interested parties. The CD can be used repeatedly and without restriction to the number of users. The CD will also come with a Point of Contact for any questions regarding the CARES II system.

CDs will be mailed out to interested parties who have previously contacted USTRANSCOM/AQ and scheduled training, on or about 13 November 2009. Other parties interested in receiving a copy of the CARES II SM training CD, can e-mail carla.diamond@ustranscom.mil and tristan.tikkanen@ustranscom.mil.

<p>This is a cost-plus award fee contract.&nbsp; The workscope to be performed utilizing Recovery Act funds was&nbsp;not awarded as a firm-fixed price contract because the workscope has already been competitively awarded under a cost-plus award fee contract after&nbsp;appropriate consideration of contract pricing strategies.&nbsp; There is a high degree of risk associated with availability of funding, waste disposition pathways, end-state definition, and agreements applicable to the scope of this contract which did not make it suitable for a fixed-price contract (FAR 16.601(c)).</p>

<DESC>Reconstruct Dry Dock #2 Middle & Outer Sill Structures:  The reconstructedsill structure includes construction of a temporary cofferdam to allowdemolition and reconstruction of the sill structures; the addition of rockanchors and dowels to the existing sill and wing walls in order to stabilizethem in the dewatered condition; phased demolition of existing granite masonryblocks and concrete bedding; phased demolition of the existing sill, seats andpartial demolition of the apron; repairs to the existing sill structuresincluding caisson sill armoring; and construction of a reinforced concrete sillstructure with two seats, each to be capable of superflood operations, anchoredto the bedrock with rock anchors.  Dewatering must be performed in accordance with State of Maine dischargepermit requirements.
New Caisson Gate: the existing rectangular type caisson serving drydock #2 willbe replaced by a similar type but deeper caisson designed to fit thereconstructed seat structures.  The floating steel caisson shall beapproximately 105 feet wide, 40 feet high and shall have a beam of 15 feet.  Itshall include side keels/stems, catwalks in the ballast tanks for inspection andmeasurement and double valves for flood tubes.  The caisson will also bedesigned with two 25,000 GPM superflood pumps and 4 36-inch diameter tubes toallow flooding of the dock.  Construction shall also include mechanical plumbingand equipment requirements including controls.  The contract will also include testing and certification requirements asrequired to meet all applicable Navy standards.
The caisson electrical system will operate from the existing 460V/ 3Ph-400Aservice.  The 460V/ 3Ph electrical service will be distributed to serve the maintank dewatering pumps, superflood pumps, electric actuators for the dewatering,superflood, equalizing and flooding isolation valves.  This service will alsosupport electrical resistance heaters and blowers for the heating andventilation system.  Transformers are to be designed to provide 277V and 120Vfor the lighting and miscellaneous receptacle power and controls systems.
The configuration of the caisson will include structural features to allow useof bilge blocks for docking to assist in resistance to overturning in the eventof seismic activity and wind forces during drydocking operations.
The steel caisson will have an all elastomeric seat gasket system as opposed tothe existing combination wood and rubber seat system.  The method of attachment to the caisson will be through welded studs.

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate an additional $27,017.00 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site.<br />The general requirement of this work is to have the contractor make recommendations to meet EPA Region 8's Risk-Based guidelines, prepare a Sampling and Analysis Plan, Health and Safety Plan, and conduct field work activities and analysis in order to define the extent of the contamination at the Old Union 76 Station LUST site, Flathead Indian Reservation, Polson, Montana.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Below is the approved Justification and Authorization for used of other than full and open competition.MEMORANDUMDate:  September 28, 2009										From:	Contracting Officer (672/PBD)Subj:   JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULLAND OPEN COMPETITION; DB DENTAL CLINIC IMPROVEMENTS.  To:	File in reference to solicitation No. VA-248-09-RP-06511. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Rios Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzalez Giusti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: Justification and approval for Other than Full and Open Competition.  This procurement is a design build sole source construction with a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB).3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Provide all labor, materials, tools and equipment, and design-build services necessary for the design and construction of the project described here in other specific tasks as further defined by this request of proposal.

In addition, these services may include: pre-design services such as facility assessments, development of design programs, schematic designs, construction documents, technical studies, standards and specifications, and/or reports.  Estimated cost is $150,950.00.4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-5 Authorized or Require by Statute.	5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  The Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is not permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals.  Negotiation with the recommendable source will accelerate contract award process.This project was competed under Service-Disable Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) lowest price technical acceptable and unable to make award for the following reasons:a. The station received nine (9) proposals.  Six (6) out of nine were SDVOSB; three (3) proposals were between 40-59 percent above Government Estimate (GE), one (1) was 136 percent above GE and the two (2) non responsive.  b. The remaining offerors; two (2) were Veteran Owned Small Business and one was not registered at the VetBiz Registry site.MSS General Contractors, Inc. proposal was the most suitable offer meeting both technical and price requirements; however, as previously mentioned, the procurement was an SDVOSB set-aside and not VOSB set-aside.It is more advantageous to the Government to initiate negotiations with MSS General Contractors, Inc., a Veteran Owned Small Business.  This contractor meet all the requirements to complete the work listed in item 3 above.This project is crucial to improve dental clinic patient care service.   6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Refer to paragraph 5. 7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  A request for Proposal will be issued to the Contractor.  Contractors proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost.  Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price for both parties. 8.  MARKET RESEARCH: A market survey was not conducted for this action. See paragraph 6 above. 9.  OTHER FACTORS: None10.  INTERESTED SOURCES: MSS General Contractors, Inc.11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: None. 12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.NAME: Mr. Israel Rodriguez              		DATE: September 28, 2009TITLE:  Contract Specialist 		        		SIGNATURE: /S/13.
