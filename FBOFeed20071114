This requirement is for one base year plus 2 one-year option periods. This requirement is subject to the availability of funds. NOTE: No Technical Data Package is available from the Government. The Government does not have complete specification, plans, or drawings available, and can not provide them to the contractor. 

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within ten (10) days of this announcement. However, other potential sources desiring to furnish other than OEM parts and services are required to submit the following information: 1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts and services (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics); 2) Complete and current information on training and configuration control of the WMSL Power Generation system (i.e. technical manuals, engineering changes and software). This data must include sufficient information to allow the USCG to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. This information is due within ten (10) days from the date of this announcement.

Information received will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this procurement. No cost or pricing data is required. This notice does not constitute a solicitation document, and request for such documents will not be considered. The Government will not pay for information received.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on provision of Communications and Information Systems (CIS) Management and Control Tools for the Joint CIS Control Center (JCCC) at International Security Assistance Force Headquarters (HQ ISAF) in Kabul, Afghanistan. This project is designed to enhance the existing JCCC capability through the provision of additional system and service level CIS control and management tools. 

NC3A is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. In response to this Notification of Intent (NOI), the U.S. Department of Commerce will be nominating to the bidders list qualified U.S. firms in addition to those already identified by NC3A.

The estimated cost of the scope of provisioning of CIS Management and Control Tools for the JCCC at HQ ISAF is Euro 2.9 million ($4.3 million). The reference of the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-12445-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO RESTRICTED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for its facility and for all personnel assigned to the contract.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

This procurement will ensure that the JCCC located at HQ ISAF, Kabul, Afghanistan becomes fully operational, with an integrated suite of CIS monitoring, management, and configuration tools required in the new JCCC building to allow the remote management and control of in-theatre communications systems, networks, and software applications.

The envisaged bidding procedure for this IFB will be the Alliance Operations and Missions (AOM) ICB procedure.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO IICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Once approved, the firm can be nominated to the bidders list. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to participate in NATO ICB: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for participation in NATO ICB must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the bidders list for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Mission to NATO, which uses the DOE to nominate the firm to the bidders list. NC3A will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Mission nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by NC3A when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility: 19 November 2007

2. Anticipated date that NC3A will forward the IFB to those on the Bidders List: December 2007

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  
It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cimarron Software, Inc. 30 East Broadway, Ste 204, Salt Lake City, UT 84111 to provide software customization and maintenance on the Cimarron Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Laboratory Workflow System (LWS).  This software is being used in a large scale Sequencing Initiative for handling patient DNA samples.  The software customization will provide local control and flexibility needed to keep up with revolutionary changes in the laboratory.  Cimarron provided the initial design and implementation of the LWS and therefore are uniquely qualified to create the additional features required to support the rapidly evolving laboratory pipeline.  An equally important component of this package is the standard maintenance support.  The period of performance will be for 12 months from date of award. The vendor will provide the following services:

?	Development of new components to the existing LWS
?	Participate in conferences
?	Document system specifications
?	Provide programmer consultation 
?	Provide annual maintenance and software support

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Cimarron is the sole source manufacturer of this system and as such are the only ones that can provide the necessary technical support.  There are no other authorized vendors for this equipment so they are the only known source that is currently able to assist the NHGRI in this software expansion project. 

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the Size Standard is $23.0M. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Technical Description: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) at Lewis Field is planning the development of a Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) for Fission Surface Power (FSP). The goal of the TDU is to assemble the major components (heat source, power conversion, heat rejection, power management and distribution) of a FSP system with a simulated nuclear heat source and conduct integrated system testing in thermal-vacuum to evaluate overall performance. FSP systems provide a potential option to support future human exploration missions on the Moon and Mars. FSP is a current technology project under the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) sponsored by the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. The FSP technology project is planned as a 5 or 6-year activity with concept definition and risk reduction that could lead to the start of a potential flight development program in the future. ETDP is managed by Langley Research Center. FSP is managed by GRC with support from Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and several Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories.  NASA GRC will be soliciting a two-phased contract for the design, fabrication and testing of a single, full-scale TDU Power Conversion Unit (PCU). The PCU would accept heat input from a simulated nuclear heat source (at approximately 800 to 900 K), generate electrical power, and reject waste heat to a water cooling system (at approximately 350 to 450K). The gross FSP system electrical power is currently estimated at about 48 kW, provided by four parallel-string power conversion units. This development activity will focus on a PCU electrical output of 12 kW. Candidate power conversion technologies include free-piston Stirling cycle, closed Brayton cycle, and organic Rankine cycle. The final testing would be conducted at a government thermal-vacuum facility. The simulated nuclear heat source and water cooling system would be Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The two-phased contract consists of Phase I: Design and Analysis, followed by Phase II: Fabrication and Testing.  Contracting Approach: The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a competitive down-selection process using the "progressive competition" down selection technique in which new, formal solicitations are not issued for phases subsequent to the initial phase. The subsequent phase proposal is anticipated to be requested by a letter accompanied by the appropriate proposal preparation and evaluation information. The Phase I design and analysis is anticipated to be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with an estimated period of performance of 15 months. Multiple contract awards are planned for Phase I. The Phase II fabrication and testing is anticipated to be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with an estimated performance of 27 months for a total estimated period of performance of 42 months.  Competitions for identified subsequent phase will build on the results of previous Phase I.  The award criteria for subsequent phases will include demonstrated completion of specified previous Phase I requirements.  The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent Phase II requirements. Proposals for the subsequent phase will be requested from these contractors.  The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequent phase(s) as this acquisition is identified as a "progressive competition" and the mechanism for providing pertinent subsequent phase proposal information (e.g., statements of work, specifications, proposal preparation instructions, and evaluation factors for award) will be provided through a letter Request For Proposal.  Each subsequent phase of the acquisition will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203.  Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered. In order to contend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase contractors. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 500 employees, respectively.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The estimated release date of the RFP is on or about December 3, 2007 with an estimated offer due date of on or about January 31, 2008.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22		     Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
The Defense Distribution Depot Red River located in Texarkana, TX has a requirement for a contractor to furnish all necessary labor, equipment, and material necessary to repair the transmission in a Terex Crane model TFC45R with serial number 172178.
The Government has requested assistance through the manufacturer for over a year.    The Government has been working with a local contractor purchasing and replacing recommended parts.  A service contract was recently awarded to a local Dana/Clark transmission service company that determined the problem was not internal to the transmission and recommended replacing a Terex shifter assembly part.  The shifter assembly was replaced and did not fix the problem.  A factory authorized representative is needed to diagnose the cause of the Terex locking in gear and accomplish the required repair to resolve the problem.  Terex Crane has identified Atlantic Machinery & Equipment located in Richmond, Virginia as the company authorized to diagnose and recommend a course of action to correct the problem.
The Government intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Atlantic Machinery and Equipment of Richmond, Virginia.
All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 5 days of date of notice to Dusty Kruger, Acquisition Operations, DDC-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-6892, fax: 717-770-7591 or email: james.kruger@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be negotiated and awarded to Atlantic Machinery and Equipment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The sessions will be scheduled on a first-come-first-served  basis.  -----  14 Nov 07: DRAFT versions of Section M and Section L of the  RFP have been posted below.  Industry Week meetings are intended to ensure  interested bidders have a clear and complete understanding of the  Government's requirements.  "Requirements" in this context reflect the  total RFP requirements for proposal submittal and program execution, not  just the SRD.  The Government is also interested in understanding  Industry's perceptions of the program cost, schedule, and performance  risks associated with the RFP requirements.  Consistent with these two  goals, the Government will entertain suggestions to revise, clarify, or  simplify/streamline the requirements in the RFP documents.  We encourage  the provision of these suggestions in an electronic form in advance of the  Industry Week meetings, with the intent of facilitating productive  discussions during the meetings.  Offerors are encouraged NOT to use the  limited meeting time to "test" the Government's reactions to possible  requirements solutions or approaches.  The Government's responses to such  inquiries will be limited to non-evaluative discussion.  Capability  briefings related to an offeror's specific training simulation technology  capabilities across similar applications should be scheduled with the 677  AESG engineering leadership outside of the context of this solicitation.

The contract will consist of cost plus incentive fee/cost plus award fee line items for each NITES-Next build (one firm line item for Build 1 and two option line items for the subsequent builds), with cost plus fixed fee option line items for Operations and Support and Demonstrations and Exercise Support. Previously posted documents pertaining to NITES-Next will be moved to a page under the Future Opportunities area within the e-commerce site, corresponding to the new solicitation number.  The final solicitation will be issued without further notice on or about December 2007.

<DESC>Global Health Support Initiative II 
Institutional Support Services
Preliminary Activity Description

The US Agency for International Development is seeking SMALL BUSINESS sources that may be able to furnish technical, operational and professional contracted staff that can provide institutional support services to our Global Health programs.  A responder to this Sources Sought announcement must be able to recruit, hire, transition, place and manage a variety of U.S.-based and overseas positions that provide support of USAID?s Global Health Programs in our Washington offices and Missions worldwide.  
Eligible Organizations
For purposes of this sources sought announcement, a small business will serve as the prime on this contract.  It is expected that the small business prime will need to subcontract to multiple other small, medium or large businesses  to form a workable framework to provide the needed institutional support services. 

Submission Instructions

USAID is interested in seeing the framework a small business would develop to handle the recruiting, hiring, transitioning, placing and managing of approximately 200 professional positions.  Approximately 60 percent of the positions are expected to be in the Washington, D.C. area, and another 40 percent will be in countries overseas.  

The framework would include general approaches to providing solutions to the ?Work To Be Performed? section of this Sources Sought announcement.

The responders must provide recent and relevant past performance in providing personnel placement services domestically and internationally.  USAID encourages responders to provide a valid US government past performance report showing experiences within the past five years.  

It is also suggested that responders cite up to five references that have knowledge of the experience and can tell USAID about the organization?s performance in relation to the work described.

Response for this Sources Sought solicitation must be:
?X	Written in English
?X	Word processing documents should be written and formatted in Microsoft Word using Arial font, 12 point, with one-inch margins all around..
?X	Spreadsheet documents should be composed in Microsoft Excel in Arial font, 10 point, with one-inch margins all around.

Once completed, responses must be emailed to Susan Scott-Vargas at sscott-vargas@usaid.gov.  This opportunity is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only.  All information must be submitted by November 27, 2007 at 4 p.m. to the previously mentioned individual via email.  No informational packages in hard copy are requested at this time.  

Work to be Performed
The purpose of this contract is to provide the Bureau for Global Health (GH) in Washington, Regional Bureaus in Washington, Regional Missions and Country Missions overseas with an as-needed mechanism to obtain technical, operational, management, support and professional services. The activities under this contract provide staff in worldwide support of USAID?s Global Health Programs under the overarching strategic goal of ?Investing in People.?  
The work performed under this contract supports the primary focus of the Global Health program area and its corresponding elements and program outcomes: 

?	Element 1:  HIV/AIDS ? Reduce the transmission and impact of HIV/AIDS through support for prevention, care and treatment programs.

?	Element 2:  Tuberculosis ? Reduce the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis (TB) by increasing detection of cases of TB and by successfully treating detected cases, as well as addressing issues of multi-drug resistant TB, TB and HIV, and investing in new tools for TB.

?	Element 3:  Malaria ? Support the implementation of the President?s Malaria Initiative (PMI), related malaria control programs, and malaria research activities to reduce malaria-related mortality.  Develop effective malaria vaccines, new malaria treatment drug, and targeted operations research.

?	Element 4:  Avian Influenza ? Limit the spread of avian influenza (AI) in animals and help   to prevent a human influenza pandemic, and in the event of a pandemic, provide appropriate humanitarian response.

?	Element 5:  Other Public Health Threats ? Address public health threats posed by infectious diseases not targeted elsewhere in the Framework, as well as significant non-communicable health threats of major public health importance.

?	Element 6:  Maternal and Child Health ? Increase the availability and use of proven life-saving interventions that address the major killers of mothers and children and improve their health and nutrition status, including effective maternity care and management of obstetric complications; prevention services including newborn care, routine immunization, polio eradication, safe water and hygiene, and micronutrients; improved maternal, infant and young child feeding; and treatment of life-threatening childhood illnesses.

?	Element 7:  Family Planning and Reproductive Health ? Expand access to high-quality voluntary family planning (FP) services and information, and reproductive health (RH)    care.  This element contributes to reducing unintended pregnancy and promoting healthy reproductive behaviors of men and women, reducing abortion, and reducing maternal      and child mortality and morbidity.

Background

In the Bureau for Global Health, the Office of Professional Development and Management Support (GH/PDMS) was created to carry out professional staff development, personnel, administrative and management functions for Global Health.  USAID has been using a series of non-direct hire (NDH) staffing mechanisms with the current mechanisms ending December 31, 2007 and September of 2008. USAID intends to award a new five-year cost plus fixed-fee contract to continue providing the necessary technical experts that are currently in place under the terminating mechanisms as well as anticipated additional placements over the next five years, both in Washington and in overseas locations.  Using NDH staffing mechanisms has enabled USAID to fill some of the critical skills gaps resulting from downsizing, hiring freezes, advent of new priorities and attrition of staff at various levels.  In addition, it has enabled USAID to supplement its direct-hire technical, professional and operational staff through contractor support in order to achieve USAID?s global health program priorities.  

Proposed Requirements

1.	Recruitment, Hiring, Placement

The Contractor shall provide direct services for the recruitment, hiring and support of experts to provide technical and managerial assistance to USAID?s programs at USAID Bureaus and Offices in Washington and in Overseas Regional Offices and Missions.  These services may include particular emphasis on high-priority areas as outlined under the above-mentioned seven Health program elements.  

Over a five-year period, approximately 200 institutional contractor placements are expected, with approximately 60% in Washington, DC, and 40% in developing countries overseas.  See the attached table for an illustrative list of countries where USAID may place personnel.  The institutional contractor staff will be hired as employees of the Contractor?s organization, and provide technical advice and management capabilities to USAID.  Institutional contractor staff shall serve as technical advisors and provide advice on technical matters, but shall not perform ?inherently governmental functions? or make final decisions or sign documents that commit the U.S. Government (defined in OMB Circular A-76).

The Contractor shall identify appropriate institutional contractor employees with the required expertise, availability, language proficiencies, and experience for each position identified.  These employees will provide technical and managerial assistance to USAID?s programs in Washington and field missions overseas.  In addition, some positions may include the following elements:  (1) to meet highly specialized technical needs; and, (2) for difficult-to-fill positions, either because of scarce labor markets or posts for which it is difficult to recruit.  While we expect this to be the exception rather than the rule, some placements may be requested on very short notice, e.g., two to four weeks, and rapid response will be essential to ensure the effectiveness of this contract.  

The institutional contractor staff will be predominantly mid-career or senior professionals in the public health sectors as called for in the SOW provided by the requesting Bureau, Regional Bureau, Regional Offices or Missions.  Institutional contractor staff will have educational and/or relevant work experience in fields related to public health, specifically with reference to the above-mentioned Elements.  Individual placements documents will outline levels of experience needed, e.g., working in specific or related discipline(s), including experience as it applies to international work, preferably in or with reference to developing countries.  

Recruitment requests shall contain the following:  position title, estimated market value, period of performance, place of performance, statement of work describing duties and responsibilities, desired start date, education/experience required for the position (including minimum criteria and preferred), selection (eligibility) factors and evaluation (knowledge, skills, and aptitude) factors.  Once given the request for recruitment, the Contractor shall post the position within its own organization and widely circulate the specific placement documents so as to access the widest range of qualified responders.  This may include, but is not limited to newspapers, electronic posting, list serves, general periodicals, sector-specific publications, trade shows, and other means as appropriate.

Once a qualified candidate has been selected for a position, the Contractor shall make all necessary arrangements for the placement of the institutional contractor employee. These hiring and placement tasks shall include but not necessarily be limited to:

?	Obtaining USAID salary approval from the CTO prior to making an official offer of employment;

?	Obtaining and maintaining the necessary security and personnel security               clearances through the Defense Security Service; 

?	For overseas placements, ensuring that the candidate and his/her dependents obtain appropriate medical tests and examinations in accordance with current USAID/US Department of State guidance prior to arranging for departure overseas; 

?	For overseas placements, ensure that the candidate and his/her dependents obtain appropriate direction and logistical support from the Contractor for transfer to the assigned country.  Handle all host country requirements for the candidate prior to deployment. USAID Missions may be consulted for information, but all logistics are the responsibility of the Contractor and institutional contractor?s employee; and,

?	Provide all new institutional contractor employees with an orientation to the Contractor?s organization, philosophy and personnel procedures, of a duration approved by the CTO and typically no more than three (3) days.  This orientation should also include a segment on USAID organization and philosophy and where appropriate information about overseas Mission.


2.	Transition of Staff from Previous Award

In addition to recruiting and hiring for new positions as they are identified, the Contractor will be responsible for the transition of approximately 80 institutional contractor staff from an expiring non-direct-hiring mechanism that is scheduled to end September of 2008.  Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

?X	Persons in positions will be given first right of refusal for the transferred positions;

?X	The CTO and the Contractor will collaborate to ensure the transition is seamless, efficient, expeditious, trouble-free and fair in terms of pay and benefits;

?X	USAID will include appropriate provisions that will allow for carry over of capped unused annual leave and sick leave that has accumulated under the expiring NDH mechanism.;

?X	The Contractor will provide the current employees with the same, or better, pay and benefits now being provided; and, 

?X	The Contractor will offer pay and benefits equivalent to what is provided to US Personal Services Contractors.  

3.	Backstopping

The Contractor shall provide all necessary support to Contractor employees and his/her dependent(s) for U.S. and overseas placements, ensuring that all provisions of applicable U.S. Government laws and regulations are observed as they relate to support, benefits, and allowances for overseas or domestic personnel.  Such laws and regulations related to support and allowance are limited to the U.S. Foreign Affairs Manual, U.S. Foreign Affairs Handbooks, and the U.S. Joint Travel Regulations, as amended.  The support tasks include but are not limited to:   

?	Obtaining necessary security clearances prior to placement of individuals;

?	Coordinating with relevant contacts (including USAID and the Department of State when necessary) requesting placement in terms of physical space, obtaining access badges, configuration of IT equipment and access to USAID network, where relevant;

?	Procuring necessary computer equipment and supplies for new placements, and replace existing equipment as it becomes outdated or non-working, as appropriate;

?	Coordinating with USAID IRM staff on the procurement and shipping of all  necessary computer equipment and accesses that may be available to USAID networks;

?	Notifying CTO and, where relevant, the Mission on projected start date of placement; 

?	Notifying CTO and the Regional Office/Mission via e-mail of expected arrival date in country (for overseas placements);

?	Complying with Department of State Country Clearance requirements three to four weeks prior to overseas assignment;

?	Coordinating in-country logistics with the Regional Office/Mission (for overseas placements); 

?	Obtaining necessary travel and allowance approvals from USAID (for overseas placements), including relocation in the U.S. when assignment has ended; 

?	Arranging for travel to and from post (for overseas placements);

?	Arranging for the packing, shipping and storage of the Contractor employee?s        household effects either in the United States for short-term assignments or to and from post  (for overseas placements) for longer term assignments;

?	Informing  and assisting the Contractor employee with additions and revisions                     to the Contractor?s personnel procedures, benefits and authorized allowances as it applies to his/her position, as well as any updates to provisions provided to U.S. PSCs; 

?	Providing financial accounting support to Contractor employees for timesheets, travel expense vouchers, advances, etc.; and, 

?	Providing technical support in the form of technical books, materials, and conference fees. 

4.	Supervision

The Contractor shall exercise an overall supervisory role, including but not limited to: oversight of the institutional contractor staff?s work performance, monitoring of working conditions, assistance with support to the health and well-being of the staff and their families (for field mission assignments/postings), and support to professional development of the staff. This task shall be done by careful monitoring of needs and activities, aided by telephone communications, e-mail, faxes from the employee?s and his/her USAID manager, field reports, and if necessary or as applicable, USAID approved field visits.  

USAID managers will set annual work objectives in conjunction with the contractor employee, evaluate work performance, and facilitate work performance within USAID programs.  These USAID roles shall be filled by the appropriate managers in the USAID Bureau, Office, Regional Office or Mission.   The Contractor shall review the annual work objectives and other oversight documents from USAID to monitor institutional contractor employee performance.

5.	Local Office

Based on the need for frequent contacts between the Contractor and GH, and requirements per Homeland Security Policy Directives, it is necessary that the Contractor establish an office located within a reasonable commuting distance of USAID in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  

6.	Reporting Requirements

A critical need under this contract is the financial reporting and cost accounting functions.  The Contractor must have a strong financial management and reporting system in order to provide the necessary financial reporting to USAID CTO, managers, USAID offices and field missions.  This contract will receive multiple sources of funding for its institutional contractor personnel, with some of the funds needing tracking for specific and special circumstances, such as the Results Review process, reporting against Congressional earmarks, for Country Operational Plans, forecasting for future needs, etc.  The Contractor shall establish and maintain financial and cost records for all the proposed, in-process and completed personnel placements.  Financial and cost records shall include all the direct and indirect charges, fees, and other requested cost elements such as required by GH Bureaus, Offices, Missions, USAID financial accounting, or Congressional earmarks to facilitate reporting of actual and proposed charges relative to the work carried out under this contract.  These records shall include work plans, schedules, budgets, and expenditures differentiated to present data relating to directed activities across the Bureau or Mission.  

The Contractor shall provide, on request, financial status reports that show the current status and balance of funds segregated by requesting Operating Unit and Element.  For planning, scheduling and financial accounting purposes, the Contractor shall develop a regular format for reporting on completed, in process and proposed placements under the contract.  By these reports, USAID contract managers and customer offices or missions must be able to determine the amount of funds provided to the contract and the amounts drawn down for each placement, expenditures to include pipeline analyses, etc.

The Contractor shall provide budgets, pipelines, and projected expenses for each placement to USAID supervisors and other USAID staff for financial planning and as requested by the CTO.  

7.	Database

There is a need for an innovative, flexible management tool designed to capture, organize, and analyze disparate contract data for timely program decision making and reporting, available on the Internet worldwide.  With the steadily increasing need of personnel, there is an urgent need for the development of more comprehensive methods of gathering and analyzing program data accessible to USAID and the contractor employees employed under this contract.  With placements also in USAID field missions overseas, USAID requires a tool that could capture and display contract data in a flexible, contextual format that contractor employees around the world could access quickly and securely from their own offices.  Therefore, the Contractor shall collaborate with USAID in creating and maintaining a common computer-based approach among USAID non-direct hire personnel management contracts and cooperative agreements to provide a computerized platform for tracking and reporting financial management and reporting methods, budget, and administrative duties.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTIVE RECOVERY AND NAPPING STRATEGIES
FOR COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS PHASES 1 AND 2
(September 2007)


1.	INTRODUCTION

Transport Canada (TC) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) are the sponsors of this research under a collaborative research project agreement signed between them. Under terms of the agreement, Transport Canada?s Transportation Development Centre (TDC) is responsible for the overall management, design and conduct of the research, all in accordance with its own normal practices and procedures.

The essence of the entire research to be undertaken under the above noted agreement is described from an overall perspective in APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, Project Implementation Plan: Investigation of Effective Recovery and Napping Strategies for Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (revision date of September, 2007).

This Work Statement is for undertaking only a part (Phases 1 and 2) of the overall four phases of research described therein.

2.	OBJECTIVES

Undertake Phases 1 and 2 of an overall research project described in general terms in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??:

Phase 1 (Napping research): Develop napping research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective napping strategies for CMV drivers.

Phase 2: (Recovery research): Develop recovery research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective recovery strategies for CMV drivers:


3.	SCOPE

The scope of the study shall include:

Phase 1 (Napping Research) will involve the development and recommendation of napping research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. Research protocols shall examine proactive naps aimed at preventing fatigue (napping prior to a work period) and reactive naps aimed at reducing and managing fatigue during the work day (napping in response to perception of fatigue). This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective napping strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

Phase 2 (Recovery Research) will involve the development and recommendation of recovery research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. This research will investigate the recovery effects associated with consolidated and split sleep during daily duty cycles, and immediately after completion of a ?day driving week? and a ?night driving week?. This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective recovery strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

The research protocols should include an equal number of motor carriers and drivers from both Canada and the U.S.

The results of Phases 1 and 2 will be presented in two technical reports, respectively, including work performed, results, conclusions and recommendations. However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.


4.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A?? describes the four phases of the overall project including objectives, deliverables, background considerations, method of implementation, and estimated schedule and budget. The PIP reflects the vision of the principal stakeholders, and is to be used as a general guideline. Bidders are expected to use their creativity and expertise to develop comprehensive bids that will address the objectives of the work to be undertaken under each of Phases 1 and 2, within the context of achieving the objectives of the overall research. 

Bids should consider addressing napping and recovery strategies that would be the most beneficial to drivers and could be applied by the industry to better manage fatigue.

Phases 1 and 2 are to be performed concurrently to the greatest extent possible. Bidders must provide bids for performance of the work included in both of Phases 1 and 2. Each phase must be addressed separately, However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.

In addition to the tasks required to execute the work described in the PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, the contractor is required to perform the following additional tasks for each of the two phases.


4.1.	Work Plan

Produce a detailed overall work plan, activity schedule, cash flow projection, project management control, and documentation procedures within three weeks of effective contract commencement date. These are to be submitted to TDC for review and approval. The work plan is to include the dates for submission and review of milestone and final reports, as well as dates of steering committee review meetings described in Section 5.6.


4.2.	 Milestone Reports

Upon completion of each major activity or milestone of the project, each of which are to be presented in the bid and later refined in the work plan of Section 4.1, prepare and submit a milestone report prepared in accordance with Section 5.7.

4.3.	Final Report

	Upon completion of the work, prepare a final report describing the objectives, scope and methodology, all work performed, data gathered and its analysis, results, conclusions and recommendations. The final report shall be prepared and submitted to TDC for review and acceptance in accordance with section 7 ?Final Report and Delivery?.

Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing, Diagnostic equipment, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), manufacturing; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical diagnostic equipment manufacturing; Medical ultrasound equipment manufacturing; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) medical diagnostic equipment manufacturing; Patient monitoring equipment (e.g., intensive care coronary care unit) manufacturing; PET (positron emission equipment tomography) scanners manufacturing; and Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners manufacturing.  According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith G. Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for  Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing, Diagnostic equipment, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); manufacturing; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical diagnostic equipment manufacturing; Medical ultrasound equipment manufacturing; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) medical diagnostic equipment manufacturing; Patient monitoring equipment (e.g., intensive care coronary care unit) manufacturing; PET (positron emission equipment tomography) scanners manufacturing; and Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334510 product number 6525. 
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) via National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to UCLA Microarray Core 695 Charles E. Young Drive South Los Angeles, CA 90095.  No period of performance.  The purchase is in conjunction with Protocol Study#03-M-0035 ?Screening, Evaluation, Diagnosis, Treatment Optimization and Follow-up for Childhood Onset Psychotic Disorders. The purpose of the research is to screen and evaluate children with psychotic disorders, establish or confirm their diagnosis, and to collect data about their condition.  Childhood Psychotic Disorders are debilitating conditions in which children have auditory or visual hallucinations and disorganized thoughts.  Using longitudinal brain imaging our research is pursuing the following questions: What is the pattern of brain development in childhood onset psychoses?  What is the relationship between the brain development pattern in COS and the clinical outcome? Is cortical gray matter loss as a trait marker?  And if so, how is cortical brain development influenced by the underlying risk genotype? Is the loss of gray matter diagnostically specific? An integral part of the research process in answering these questions requires the use of microarray chips. 

The Child Psychiatry Branch has an ongoing collaboration with the UCLA Department of Genetics, Microarry Core for the past three years. The laboratory owns Affymetrix instruments which is necessary to run the microarrays. This equipment is prohibitively expensive and we don?t have the lab space to conduct these assays, therefore we had to collaborate with UCLA to complete these experiments. In order to complete our initial screen of our rare cohort of childhood-onset schizophrenia patients, we need to run additional arrays.  It is imperative for us to continue using the same product from Affymetrix, and under the same laboratory conditions, otherwise the reliability and consistency of the research we have already collected, and at significant cost would be jeopardized. 

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI70016 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch 31, Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892 Attention: Kathleen Gregory

<SUBJECT>61 -- Installation of Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems
<DESC>NOAA?s Acquisition and Grants Office, Mountain region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR Part 15, with Riviera Electric for the completion of an installation, commissioning and energization project of two rotary uninterruptible power supply systems located on the DOC Campus, Boulder, CO.  This project is a re-procurement of a contract which was terminated for cause.  The job site has since been abandoned.

The sole source determination is based on justification that the project has been ongoing since September 2004 and is approximately 80% complete.  The jobsite is currently in an abandoned state, with equipment pieces and parts misplaced.  Numerous pieces of equipment and the building enclosure require repair, replacement or alteration due to damage or safety code non-compliance.  As this was a design/build project, going forth, coordination with the installing subcontractor, medium voltage design engineer and equipment supply subcontractors will be required to determine the current state of the project as it is today, so that a comprehensive project plan can be submitted for the completion of the re-procured project.  Once assembled, the equipment must be tested, energized, commissioned and certified.  Additionally, a one year maintenance plan will be required.  Clean up of the job site from the previous contractor is also required.   Riviera Electric has been on the jobsite as a subcontractor to this project since performance commenced and has intimate, technical and historical knowledge of the performance issues encountered, and the remainder of work that needs to be completed.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide the management, supervision, labor, supplies, equipment, and expertise to complete this project to meet the Government?s requirements as indicated above may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Documentation shall include evidence that the company has completed similar projects involving specialized equipment which were partially completed without substantial delays or start-up costs to the Government.  Documentation shall also include the company?s plan on how they propose to determine what work has been completed, what is still required to complete the project, and how to determine what parts, materials and equipment require repair or replacement prior to substantial project completion.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Spark Holland, Inc, 666 Plainsboro Road Ste 1336, Plainsboro, NJ 08536.  The contract will require Spark Holland to provide maintenance service for two Symbiosis Spark Holland Systems.  This is a sole source requirement because the Symbiosis Systems (CDC #154538 and #185248) can only be maintained through Spark Holland.  Spark Holland is the only company that manufactures this type of instrumentation.  Spark Holland is also the only manufacturer that can provide an on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) systems with the capability of automatically exchanging the SPE cartridges.  The exchange of cartridges is needed to ensure validity of the analytical results because of the complexity of the serum matrix.  The Symbiosis system coupled to an Agilent 1100 HPLC pump, already available, can automatically exchange SPE cartridges after a pre-set number of samples have been analyzed.  Spark Holland is the only company capable of exchanging the SPE cartridges in a way that is completely synchronized with the operation of auto sampler, HPLC pump and mass spectrometer data collection.   

The contract period will consist of one basic year and four one year options. The place of contract performance will be 4770 Buford Highway, NE, Atlanta, GA.  The estimated contract award dated is December 17, 2007. 

This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.

<SUBJECT>A -- NSRP ASE Research Announcement
<DESC>The NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program is interested in receiving proposals (technical and cost) on the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers - solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts.  Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs, thereby enabling the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan:  Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP ASE.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) is posted at www.nsrp.org along with associated proposal guidance, forms, and sample contracts. This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices across the following major initiative areas in U.S. shipyards: Shipyard Production Process Technologies; Business Process Technologies; Product Design and Material Technologies; Systems Technology; Facilities, Tooling, and Risk Management; and Crosscut Initiatives. These major initiatives are described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) located at www.nsrp.org. Offerors are strongly advised to read the SIP in order to gain a greater understanding of the sub-initiative areas detailed below. Because the program major initiatives are closely tied to each other, proposals may be submitted with a scope that represents integrated efforts across several major initiative and/or sub-initiative areas.  The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.  Potential proposers are reminded that there are several requirements incorporated in NSRP Research Announcements beginning in 2004 that bear particular attention, including cost share requirements and project metrics.

Full Proposals in response to this RA must be received by January 23, 2008 12:00 PM (noon) Eastern Time, addressed to NSRP ASE Program Administrator, Advanced Technology Institute, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, Attn: Ms. Melanie Ridenhour, ATI Contracts Department.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN08-09 - Proposers' Day for BioFuels Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host two Proposers' Day Conferences in support of the BAA08-07, BioFuels - Cellulosic and Algal Feedstocks (BioFuels) program on December 4, 2007 at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott in Los Angeles, California from 8:30am to 4:30pm, and on December 6, 2007 at the Washington Dulles Airport Marriott, Dulles, Virginia from 8:30am to 4:30pm.  The purpose of these conferences is to provide information on the BioFuels - Cellulosic and Algal Feedstocks (BioFuels) program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the BioFuels - Cellulosic and Algal Feedstocks (BioFuels) program is to develop affordable alternatives to petroleum-derived JP-8 from agricultural and aquacultural feedstock materials. This solicitation is focused on dramatically broadening the portfolio of feedstock materials suitable for the affordable and efficient production of alternatives to petroleum-derived JP-8.

The principal goal for this new capability is the demonstration of scaleable commercializable processes for the affordable (<$3/gallon) production of a JP-8 surrogate fuel. Proposers are encouraged to consider process paths that minimize the use of external energy sources, are adaptable to as wide as possible a range of feedstocks, and produce process by-products that have ancillary manufacturing or industrial value. It is anticipated that the key technology developments needed to obtain the program goal will result from a cross-disciplinary approach spanning the fields of process chemistry and engineering, materials engineering, biotechnology, and propulsion system engineering.

Key objective parameters include, but are not limited to two technical areas.  Technical Area One: Technologies and Processes for the Conversion of Cellulosic Materials to Affordable JP-8 Surrogate.  Cellulosic feedstock materials, comprised of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin components, offer the potential of a widely available low cost feedstock material. Unlike the long-chain hydrocarbon molecules found in crop triglyceride oils, these materials feature a higher degree of contamination with non-convertible material, shorter chain lengths, and typically a higher degree of oxidation. Correspondingly, the challenge in this technical area is the development of highly efficient integrated processes that results in the target JP-8 product. (e.g. preprocess, hydrogenate, oligimerize, and isomerize the target biomolecules)

Technical Area Two: Processes for the Affordable Manufacture of Algal-Derived JP-8 Surrogate. Algae offer the potential of a significant volume feedstock with extremely large yields per acre and which can be fundamentally non-competitive with the production of feedstocks. The affordable production of JP-8 surrogate from algae crop stocks requires reducing the cost of algae triglyceride oil to the $1-2/gal level.  Current large scale production of algae crops, however, is limited to product applications that support crop costs significantly greater than $20/gal. The key challenge in this area is the development of an integrated production system that combines advances in photo-bioreactor design, integrated closed-reactor and open-reactor concepts, algae nutrition management, cropstock selection, waste stream management, intermediate product extraction, and optimized conversion to JP-8.

Additional parameters will be listed in BAA08-07 and will be discussed at the Proposers' Day Conference. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT November 27, 2007.  Please send an email to BAA08-07@darpa.mil requesting a Proposers' Day registration form.   Instructions for registering will be on the registration form.  Directions to the facility and other materials will be sent via e-mail once the registration form has been received.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  Proposers' Day materials will be available on the BAA website.

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 3 representatives per organization.  It is not necessary to attend both Proposers' Days as the agenda for both is identical.  The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request".  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Amy Flynn, ManTech SRS Technologies, fax 703-741-7803, phone 703-351-7281, no later than November 27, 2007.  The necessary document will be emailed, once the registration form has been received.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain 2 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact Amy Flynn at BAA08-07@darpa.mil or 703-351-7281 as soon as possible, but no later than 4:00pm EST, November 26, 2007.  

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the funding organization and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will review and approve in advance any presentations to ensure there is no material that is subject to the Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by November 26, 2007.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of intent to extend the services
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to extend the services and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The United States Department of the Army, Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) intends to extend the period of performance of contract number W91 1W4-04-D-0005 with L-3 Communications Titan Corp (L-3) for 90 days to provide uninterrupted support as a follow-on competitive acquisition was not awarded in time to a the offeror.  The new competitive procurement was released under Solicitation Number W91 1W4-05-R-0001 which was synopsized in FedBizOpps on June 14, 2006.  The extension will continue the performance period for an initial three (3) months.  The extension period of performance will be from December 10, 2007 through March 8, 2008. The extension  is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(b), which authorizes other than full and open competition when an unacceptable delay precludes full and open competition, and delay in aw ard of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government. To USAs knowledge and belief, the services to perform foreign language interpretation and translation services in support of United States Army, its Unified Commands (USEUCOM, USCENTCOM, USSOUTHCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM), attached forces, combined forces, and joint elements who are executing the military mission known as Operation Iraqi Freedom-Iraq (OIF-I) and other U.S. Government agencies who are supporting the OIF-I  mission would not have the essential services needed to meet mission needs. Without linguist support, it will not only undermine the war effort and lead to mission failure, but will also lead to the endangerment of Warfighters and place the critical tasks  required in jeopardy and hinder the Global War on Terrorism. Firms who want to challenge the extension must submit an interest letter that demonstrates: 1) the firm's ability to perform the work as described in the solicitation and 2) the firms ability to provide the requisite personnel and be fully operational by December 10, 2007. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within three (3) days of this notice to: John Isgrigg, via e-mail to john.isgriggiii@us.army.mil. A determination by the Government not to proceed  with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this extension is to provide the required support services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisiti on is completed as described in the first paragraph above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541930.

These lands will be located in various locations in the State of West Virginia.  The final maps will be sealed by a land surveyor licensed in the state of West Virginia.

Prior to commencement of the surveys, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will furnish the contractors a copy of the following for each property:  deed(s), tax map(s), county road map(s) and if requested GRP and WRP Application, Soil Survey map showing the land to be included in the easement, and Preliminary Certificate of Inspection and Possession.

Within the time deadline established by the Notice to Proceed, which will be issued by the NRCS, the Contractor shall:

(1)	Verify the necessary recorded description(s) of the property on which the survey will take place to insure the easement description prepared conforms to the grantor?s ownership.

While accomplishing the survey work, the Contractor shall insure that lines of cut, necessary to perform the survey, through timberland or other environmentally sensitive areas are minimized to the greatest extent possible, to only that necessary to accomplish the necessary survey.  Before any areas are disturbed, the surveyor shall consult and have agreement with the NRCS representative. Agreement of areas to be disturbed should be accomplished during the site visit or at an agreed to date and time.  

The plat map shall show both the easement and the access route.

(3)	Set permanent monuments, which shall be installed by the surveyor at the time the survey is completed and prior to delivery of the plat of survey and legal description.  Monuments shall be installed at all angle points.  Acceptable monuments are:

(4)  All monuments shall be identified with a witness post.  In addition, witness posts shall be placed on the easement line between monuments when the distance between monuments is 500 feet or greater.  Witness posts shall also be placed between monuments when the topography prevents a clear view between monuments.  The maximum distance between witness posts shall be 500 feet.

All witness posts shall be flagged with highly visible flagging and shall have the top six inches of the posts painted silver.  Witness posts shall be a minimum of 78 inches in length with a minimum of 48 inches above ground and a minimum of 24 inches below ground.  

A sign, which will be provided by NRCS, shall be attached to each witness post. The sign will be attached to the witness post by galvanized nails or stainless steel bolts and nuts of adequate size to ensure the sign is securely attached to the witness post.  

The post shall be furnished by the surveyor.

(6)	Compute the area within the easement to the accuracy required by the state or county where the easement will be recorded.

(7)	Plot the easement boundary on a plot of the grantor's parcel, which contains the easement within its boundaries, to ensure the easement does not encroach on adjoining property.  Any conflicts with any adjoining properties will be corrected by the surveyor, both on the ground, and on the plat map and legal description, by obtaining all necessary information to correct the encroachment.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 



Closing date and time for receipt of offers is November 30, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about December 03, 2007. Contact David W. Allen at David.W.Allen@uscg.mil or 252-335-6494 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>Additional Questions and Answers: A few questions have been asked of me in reference to the steel flooring.  Is the contractor to replace the existing marine plywood flooring with a steel floor and if so what would be the thickness?  Or can the contractor cover the existing plywood floorin g with steel?  Do you have any idea of what the end user is planning for on usage of the units?       Answer:  If the prospective contractor wants to cover the wood flooring w/metal, that's ok, providing the cost does not increase. Provision DFARS 252.225-7000, and DFARS Clauses 252.225-7001 and 252.232-7010 are to be included as well.
