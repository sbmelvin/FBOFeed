Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department’s networking system.  Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure base on existing management tools and routing capabilities.  Furthermore, the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) is IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a bran name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Vulture air vehicle program is an exploratory development program to develop the capability to deliver and maintain a single airborne payload on station for an uninterrupted period of at least 5 years using a heavier-than-air platform system.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, develop and demonstrate advanced reliability technologies for air vehicle systems.  Other advanced technologies may also be developed and demonstrated depending upon the nature of the architectures proposed by offerors. The Government is not interested in approaches that use either radioactive energy sources or employ any form of buoyant flight for this application. 

The Vulture program will research and develop technologies and systems which will enable the military to deliver and maintain a 1000 lb, 5 kW airborne payload for an uninterrupted period of at least 5 years with an on-station probability of 99% and with a high probability of mission success.  The architectures selected and the specific approaches taken by the offerors will determine the range of technical areas that are developed, including, but not limited to, environmental energy collection, high specific energy storage, extremely efficient propulsion systems, precision robotic refueling, autonomous materiel transfer, extremely efficient vehicle structural design, and mitigation of environmentally-induced loads.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Tolis Group, Inc., 8687 E Via de Ventura, Ste 115, Scottsdale, AZ 85258-3347 for the purchase of the following items: 

Complete integrated backup rackmount system, 7.5 TB (net) RAID 5, redundant power supplies, SCSI HBA, 150 client licenses, 3 year depot hardware warranty, 1 year software support. Also includes BRUAPP 3 year onsite nextday extended warranty service and BRU server extended support plan, 2 years, for 25 to 149 clients.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334112.

Sole Source Justification:
 
AFRL/IFSB requires a disk based backup system to support the Agents Technology Research (ATR) in house program. A disk based system is required as an appropriate tape storage facility is not available. The backup system will be responsible for performing incremental and full backups of the ATR data and system files. In addition, the system will have to backup data from a variety of platforms including Solaris, Linux, MacOS, and MS Windows. The Tolis Group bruApp R7500 is a complete, turn key disk backup system using Linux operating system which can be integrated easily and rapidly with existing ATR hardware and software. It provides client support for all required platforms and can perform unattended backups during off hours through a scheduling mechanism. Tolis is the only known source that offers a complete disk based backup system that supports all required client platforms at a reasonable cost.

<DESC>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is requesting industry comment on a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) to acquire production ready Special Operations Forces (SOF) Deployable Node ? Lite (SDN-L) systems.  The primary objective of the SDN-L program within USSOCOM is to leverage ongoing industry initiatives/commercial items in the area of portable Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminal technologies to satisfy SDN-L performance/operational requirements with a Government funded development program.  The SDN-L requirement is to procure up to 1048 non-developmental, commercially available, transit case configured, rugged, portable satellite communications (SATCOM) terminal that provides secure and non-secure voice, video and data communications to SOF worldwide.

In addition USSOCOM is seeking information on portable SATCOM technologies as alternatives to INMARSAT BGAN technology to meet SDN-L performance and operational requirements. USSOCOM is requesting information on mature portable SATCOM technologies only. Desired technologies must provide a clear alternative capability that can be immediately leveraged for the SDN-L program. 

This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The RFP will be posted on Fed Biz Ops and shall likely be designated as a small business set aside since the corresponding market investigation determined that multiple small businesses were capable of satisfying this requirement.  The NAICS code is 334220. 
 
The basis for contract award shall be BEST VALUE, with evaluation factors consisting of technical, past performance and total cost of ownership.  The technical evaluation will assess both the written proposal and an Initial Production System (IPS) demonstration at a Government designated facility.  The RFP will identify the IPS demonstration set-up, procedures, and performance parameters that will be assessed as part of the Source Selection.  Each offeror shall provide an operational IPS for evaluation comprised of portable SATCOM terminal, custom baseband module, HAIPES compliant encryption device, laptop computer (GFE) and ancillary devices. The purpose of the IPS demonstration is to assess the technical maturity of the product proposed and the realism of the offeror?s proposed schedule for delivery of the production test articles.  The IPS must possess all of the required SATCOM, TEMPEST and safety certifications prior to the IPS demonstration.  If the IPS does not include all of the baseline performance parameters as described in the SOO, then the offeror shall explain in its technical proposal what additional effort is required to fully implement those parameter(s).  Additional capabilities exceeding the SDN-L baseline requirements that are proposed for delivery in the SDN-L first production units must be included in the IPS demonstration.  Instructions will be provided in the RFP regarding the location and time of the IPS demonstration.  

The Government anticipates, upon conclusion of source selection, the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with a five year contract for hardware ordering period and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  The USSOCOM requirement is for up to 1048 SDN-L production systems, training, and ancillary equipment and spares.

RFP/HHSI161200700145C:  SCOPE OF WORK:  The existing pneumatic HVAC control system and all associated equipment and devices for the clinic are to be replaced with a new direct digital control (DDC) system.  This work includes replacing existing control valves, dampers, space sensors, and all required programming, network cabling, etc., required to put the system into full operation.  The central plant HVAC control system shall be integrated with the DDC system proposed above.  The system will be programmed to allow remote monitoring and control of the plant equipment.  The existing central air-handling unit serving the building will be reused, but will have the fan speed increased.

The quantity of outside air entering the unit will also be increased as required by the current building occupancy.  A new filter bank will be added and will serve as the final filter section.  The existing split system air conditioning unit will be reused, but retooled to only serve the Computer Data Room.  The existing exhaust fan EF-10 will be replaced.  All other exhaust fans will be reused.  In response to complaints of dust entering the building through the existing sidewall exhaust louvers, new hooded shields will be installed at the existing louvers.  The existing hot water baseboard heaters will remain, but the wall-mounted thermostat will be replaced with a control valve at the heater.

<SUBJECT>D -- Navy - Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA)
<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060
<RESPDATE>063007
<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

The anticipated release date of the RFP is the week of 30 June 2007. Upon formal release of the RFP, interested parties will be able to view/download the RFP (N00019-07-R-0060) which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.     

In addition to making the solicitation available for downloading via the Internet site, this office will also attempt to E-mail a notification of release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to all prospective offerors that submit a request to register for this information via E-mail. E-mail requests should be sent to the following address: Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil and should include the following information for the purpose of compiling a Bidders Mailing List: 1. Company Name 2. Company Address 3. Point-of-contact, telephone number, fax number and E-mail address. In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to use the Internet for the purpose of submitting requests relative to this solicitation. Telephone requests for the solicitation will neither be accepted nor returned. A paper copy of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available or issued. 

NOTE:     Contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.   

All Discussions, Comments, Or Questions relative to the the MFOQA Solicitation must be addressed directly to the Contracts office.  They may be addressed to Ms. Maureen Bernard, PCO, at (301) 757-5899 or maureen.bernard@navy.mil and/or  Ms. Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, at (301) 757-6572 or  melanie.bateman@navy.mil

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS RFQ AND INCORPORATED PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE THOSE IN EFFECT THROUGH FEDERAL ACQUISITION CIRCULAR (FAC) 05-18.  THIS SOLICITATION IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 561730, WITH A SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD OF $6.5 Million.  THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ENCOURAGES THE PARTICIPATION OF SMALL, DISADVANTAGED, AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT TO THE RESPONSIBLE OFFEROR WHOSE TOTAL OFFER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, PRICE AND OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED.  PRICES MUST INCLUDE ALLCOSTS FOR ALLWORK SHOWN.  GATEWAY NATIONAL RECREATION AREA HAS A REQUIREMENT NEED FOR REMOVAL OF VEGETATION FROM FORT TOMPKINS AND BATTERY DUANE. BACKGROUND Fort Tompkins, located within Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island Unit, Gateway National Recreation Area, was built during the years 1859-1872 to support the defense of New York Harbor.  The fortification is constructed primarily of brick and granite block with an Earthen-capped roof.  The soil characteristics (depth, fertility, exposure, etc.) of the earthen roof support vegetative growth.  Herbaceous plant establishment and growth is desired to ensure soil stability and minimize the possibility of structural damage that would result from soil erosion.  Over the past several years, woody vegetation, including Ailanthus, Cherry, Sassafras, Oak, and Sumac has established itself within the earthen roof and between the stonework of the Fort itself.  This vegetation is now adversely impacting the structure and without immediate removal, will increasingly cause damage to the historic fortification. OBJECTIVES   Protect the historic fortification and associated earthen roof from vegetative impacts through the removal of woody plants; reduce potential for further woody plant impacts to the resource by mechanically removing woody vegetation. In addition, chemically treating stumps to prevent re-sprouting is imperative as much of the woody vegetation is difficult to access and a remaining living root system will continue to cause deterioration of the structure; The vegetation must be removed from the vicinity of the moat walls to reduce potential impact to the fortification resulting from tree growth, uprooting, leaning and falling.  An additional goal is to enhance the educational and interpretive value of the fort by removing vegetation that limits historic views, vistas, and visitor access to the site.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK: LINE ITEM 1.  Removal of approximately 1.25 acres of woody vegetation in Area 1, to include all trees, shrubs, weeds, vines and all associated woody growth on the barbette tier, which is located on the earthen roof situated at the top of shear stone walls approximately 35 feet in total height.  Due to the height of the walls and the steep sloping nature of the earthen roof, specialized equipment and techniques are needed to effectively and safely accomplish this project.   LINE ITEM 2:  Removal of all vegetation that is greater than 6 inches in diameter and less than 12 inches in diameter except as marked on site, in Area 2, approximately, 0.5 acres.  This area is known as the Counter Scarp, (a wooded area above the moat walls) and includes the entire knoll area on both side of the existing fence.  LINE ITEM 3: Removal of all vegetation up to 6 inches diameter, except as marked on site, within Area 2, which is described in Item 2.  LINE ITEM 4:   Removal of all vegetation greater that 6 inches diameter and less than 12 inches in diameter within Area 3, approximately 0.5 acres located in and around Battery Duane. TECHNICAL PROVISIONS:  VEGETATION REMOVAL 1.  All trees that will be removed will be cut down to ground level. 2.  Vegetation is to be cut using hand or power tools at existing soil grade level where possible.  If conditions/access do not allow for cutting to grade level, up to three inches above this level is acceptable. 3.  To ensure safe working conditions, all vegetation within 8 feet of wall edges are to be cut with a power or manual, pole-pruner from an aerial lift. 4.  All other vegetation can be cut with power saws or handsaws. 5.  Root systems and stumps should not be removed and should be allowed to remain in place. DEBRIS HANDLING AND DISPOSAL  1.  All cut vegetative debris shall be legally disposed offsite of National Park service property. 2. If larger debris cannot be transported by hand, skidding and/or other techniques for handling material is to be accomplished without measurable soil/site disturbance (this would include, but is not limited to, damage to historic or other built features, soil rutting, and soil compaction). 3. Ground protection to minimize soil site disturbance that could result from the use of equipment or debris removal, maybe required as determined by the park.  Where needed, install two layers of 4- inch plywood in a crisscrossed pattern to fully cover the area to be protected. 4. Please note that an approved staging area for storage of equipment and temporary storage of debris has been identified as the parking area adjacent to battery Tompkins' Barbette, along Tompkins Street, between Fort Tompkins and Battery Duane. Use of any other area for staging or storage or any kind would require prior approval in writing form, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). HERBICIDE APPLICATION 1. Apply Garlon 4 herbicide or equal in accordance with the manufacturer's label for "Cut Stump Treatment" found on pages 3-4 of the attached label. 2.  Apply Garlon *4 or equal by spraying, wiping or painting the herbicide to the root collar area, sides of stumps, and outer portion of the cut surface including the cambium until thoroughly wet, but not to the point of runoff. (Due to proposed goat browsing on Battery Duane - limit the spraying of Garlon or equalto the Counter Scarp and to the Barbette) 3.  Apply the herbicide immediately after the trunk or stem is cut.  Any delay will minimize the effectiveness of the application. 4.  Incorporate a staining agent into the herbicide mix to monitor and document the application. 5.  Use a product that is labeled compatible with Garlon *4 or equal similar to Becker Underwood Inc. Colorfast Green II, Colorfast Purple or Colorfast Red. 6.  For those stumps that are readily accessible, apply Garlon 4 or equal using a backpacker knapsack sprayer using low pressures and a solid cone or flat fan nozzle. 7.  For stumps within 8 feet of wall edges or wherever access with a sprayer would be difficult, apply the herbicide from an aerial lift using a wand extension on a backpack/knapsack sprayer or using a pole wick applicator or ejector such as sideswipe or E-Z Lance. 8.  Application of Garlon4 or equal must be accomplished under the guidance and supervision of a New York State certified pesticide applicator. 9.  All operations shall be conducted in accordance with ANSIZ133.1-2006 Safety Requirements for Arbor Cultural Operations, OSHA 1910 General Industry standards, and all state and local safety requirements. 10.  All safety recommendations listed on the Garlon 4 or equal label are to be followed including all applicators use required personal protective equipment (PPE).

This sole source justification is for the purchase of an automated chemistry analyzer system and corresponding parts for  flow injection analysis.   II.	STATEMENT OF FACTS JUSTIFYING SOLE SOURCE AWARD:  The equipment that will be purchased is to be used with existing equipment owned by the EPA. It is necessary to keep the same manufacturer for the proper function and communication between the existing equipment.  No  other manufacturer?s equipment will communicate with the existing OI Analytical system.  Use of other brand name chemistry analyzers would require extensive duplicate costs to EPA. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses equipment, and upgraded OI Analytical parts that  will function and communicate with our existing OI products.  This unique equipment is essential for contract performance because no other manufacturer?s equipment will function and communicate with the OI Analytical equipment.  Also, no other vendor is authorized to distribute these automated  analyzers. III.	OI Analytical is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirements.  OI Analytical is the manufacturer of the equipment and they are the only company that offers the upgraded analyzer system. IV.	STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO PRECLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR FUTURE  SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION FOR THE SAME SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  This acquisition is for upgrades to an existing system.  Manufacturers of similar systems may have the ability to compete for future acquisitions of complete systems.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with TSI Incorporated to provide a Partical Sizing and Count Instrument for the U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL).  The NAICS code is 334519. Based on the EPA's knowledge of particle sizing and count instrumentation for direct air pollution measurements, TSI Inc. is the only contractor in the world that currently offers a water-based condensation particle counter, coupled  with a differential mobility analyzer column in a package that is capable of a)being rapidly deployed to the field over a wide range of environmental conditions and b)making simultaneous measurements of a large particle range (0.005 ug to 1.0 ug) over a large span of concentrations (up to 2x107  particles per cm3) in both the laboratory and field setting.  The instrumentation must be outfitted with a refillable water-based condensation particle counter because the instrument will be deployed in enclosed, indoor spaces in the field.  The standard butanol-based CPC counters are unacceptable  because they pose an untenable breathing and fire risk for instruments deployed in trailers that are occupied by humans. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.   Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334519.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No  telephone requests will be honored.

Affymetrix Inc. has exclusive copyrights, patents, and/or trade secret ownership; and, therefore, is the only vendor that can satisfy the requirement.  In order to  ensure correct instrument operation, the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(b) (1) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to  demonstrate the contractor's ability to provide maintenance of the instrument and instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Charles River Laboratories, Inc.  FDA will purchase the following and there are no potential substitutes.  


1.	The Laboratory of Enteric and Sexually Transmitted Diseases has developed three separate vaccine candidate Salmonella strains that have been patented by FDA. Patent law requires that each of these strains be produced in a characterized cell bank for the quick availability to patent licensees.
2.	There are currently two commercial entities who have applied for the above mentioned patent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Technology Transfer Office, these entities are reliant on the production of these Salmonella strains by the end of Sept. 2007. In order to meet the above legal requirements, FDA must to develop characterized cell banks within the prescribed timeframe and to its specifications. If FDA were to miss the deadline it would violate agreements established with the commercial entities, and possibly patent law, as well as delay development of much needed vaccines.

Requirement:

Cell Bank Preparation (MCB)
	Preparation of 100 vials including the following tests:
	

	Phenotypic & Microbiological Analysis
Purity, Identification and Viability Testing of Microbial Suspensions


3.	Produce under cGMP manufacturing conditions three 100 vial cell banks, each comprising a separate Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty21a strain expressing different foreign antigens.
Strain A is S. Typhi Ty21a(pXK50) which expresses the Shigella sonnei form I lipopolysaccharide(LPS) genes.
Strain B is S. Typhi Ty21a(pSd1) which expresses the Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 LPS genes. 
Strain C is S. Typhi Ty21a(PA) which expresses the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen(PA) in a secreted form.
4.	Each strain, when provided by FDA, will be grown in specified nutrient media, washed, concentrated and lyophilized to generate 100 vials, each containing between 5 x 109 and 1010 viable CFUs/vial. Vials will be stored at 4C prior to characterizing a sample of vials for purity, viability, and strain identification. After characterization, each Master cell bank will be transferred to FDA.
5.	Production of the three cell banks must be completed by Sept. 30, 2007.

Charles River Laboratories is the only known company who can guarantee quality of product and completion of the cell bank by the specified date, under the criteria referenced above.  Any manufacturing delay or development of inadequate or contaminated samples will have wide reaching ramification, including but not limited to breaking agreements with commercial entities and risk the health of potential vaccine recipients. 


NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>H -- Functional DNA Repair Assays for Lung Cancer Risk
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-70104-NV

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX  77030 for laboratory services to perform functional DNA repair assays for lung cancer risk within the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) trial.  The REB seeks to determine the predictive usefulness of several phenotypic or functional assays that have been associated with increased cancer risk by previous investigators.  The predictiveness of these assays has, however, been hotly debated because the tests were performed on biologic specimens collected after cancer diagnosis and may be measuring the consequence rather than the underlying causes of cancer.  Investigators in REB are extremely interested in determining whether the assays can be used in prospectively collected samples because this would establish, in principle, that the case-control study design was not invalidated by reverse causation bias.  Several investigators worldwide have used functional tests (e.g. G2 or mutagen sensitivity, host-cell reactivation, and Comet assays) in case-control studies to evaluate human cancer risk associated with these various measures of DNA damage or DNA damage repair capacity (DRC).  Many of these studies provide data suggesting that elevated DNA damage induced by in vitro mutagen exposure (or reduced DRC) was associated with increased cancer risk at several sites (e.g. head and neck, lung, brain, breast, bladder, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer).  Because lung cancer is one of the primary cancer sites of interest in the PLCO trial, investigators have established immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) for lung cancer cases and matched controls.  Importantly, the blood cells from the cases were collected before their lung cancer diagnosis.  Lung cancer is one of the malignancies that has been examined extensively by functional tests in hospital-based case-control studies, most notably by investigators at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.  As a primary aim of this new contract, the REB seeks a long-standing expert in the application of specific functional assays among lung cancer cases and controls. The purpose of the procurement is to assess lung cancer risk in relation to selected DNA repair functional assays using prospectively collected (pre-diagnostic) cryopreserved samples, thus addressing the potential reverse-causation bias of previous studies.  Investigators in the Epidemiology Department of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center are premier experts in the application of a battery of functional DNA repair tests for several cancer sites, but most notably lung cancer and cancers of the upper respiratory tract.  This laboratory provided the primary initial evidence that the assays predict lung cancer risk, but their studies have been limited to retrospective analyses.   The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center has established an ongoing body of work and set the standard for conducting these specific functional assays (mutagen sensitivity with the bleomycin challenge and the host cell reactivation (HCR) assay with a BPDE challenge), no other laboratory can serve the government?s purpose in showing that the assay results are not affected by the diagnosis of lung cancer.  The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Research Center is the only source known to the NCI Researchers with the credible regard by the scientific community to perform these assays. The assays must be performed at one location as uniform quality control standards are of paramount importance.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service they may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 9, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the following organizations to expand the scope of work and extend the periods of performance of their current contracts for an additional three years: Clinical Trials & Surveys Corporation, Children?s Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, St. Jude Children?s Hospital, State University of New York, University of Miami, University of Mississippi, and University of Texas Southwestern. These organizations were originally awarded contracts in September 2000 for a project entitled "Pediatric Hydroxyurea Phase III Clinical Trial (aka BABY-HUG)".  The period of performance for all contracts currently expires on December 31, 2009.   The purpose of the contracts is to conduct a Phase III, two-year, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 200 patients to determine if Hydroxyurea can prevent the onset of chronic end organ damage in young children with sickle cell anemia (HbSS). The contractors have successfully enrolled patients into this trial and the final child is expected to enter the BABY-HUG treatment protocol by July 2007 and complete treatment in July 2009. The expanded work scope will add a Follow-Up Study to provide structured follow-up of the children enrolled in the original BABY-HUG treatment study in order to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with Hydroxurea at an early age.  In performing the expanded work scope, this unique group of children will be intensively followed for growth, development, and clinical status through puberty or early adulthood to document any alterations in the natural history of sickle cell disease associated with early Hydroxyurea therapy.  This three-year extension is the initial installment in that effort and, as such, requires the continuation of care and follow-up at the original institutions, as well as continued data accrual and analysis at the original coordinating center.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302 1, Clinical Trials & Surveys Corporation, Children?s Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, St. Jude Children?s Hospital, State University of New York, University of Miami, University of Mississippi, and University of Texas Southwestern are the only sources capable of performing this requirement due to their prerequisite knowledge and experience in performing preliminary and current work on this trial, as well as their accrual of a unique patient population.  Due to the inherent duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in performance, noncompetitive modifications to the current contracts is in the best interest of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements, as described above.  All responses must be submitted by September 13, 2007 to the following address: Debi Spillan, Contract Specialist, Office of Acquisitions, NHLBI, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6138, MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is soliciting proposals in the following area of Advance Guidance and Control - Assessment of Operational and Safety Benefits. The objective of the SIR is to solicit proposals in the following area of flight safety research to conduct research that removes some of the obstacles to the introduction and certification of advanced flight guidance and control (FG&C) systems that are safer and operationally more effective than the current generation of FG&C systems onboard transport aircraft.  The work will implement a previously developed representative advanced functionally-integrated FG&C system called Total Energy Control System (TECS) and Total Heading Control System (THCS) algorithms in a part-task simulation, and perform an in-depth effectiveness and safety evaluation. The research task shall use the simulation and other methods to analyze the TECS/THCS system concept, identify possible certification issues and avenues to resolve them, and develop appropriate system operational, performance and safety requirements and objectives.  The outputs generated from this research will be used by the FAA as input for development of FAA policy and guidance, as well as provide input to later tasks that will subsequently accomplish the overall research plan. The Technical evaluation will be based on three (3) factors: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Relevance to Aviation Safety; and (3) Research Performance Competence. Offerors will be required to submit separate technical and cost proposals.  For evaluation purposes, technical is considered more important than cost. Award will be based on Best Value to the Government. Only technical proposals with a technical rating of Outstanding or Highly Acceptable will be considered for award. Interested parties responding to this Solicitation are directed to the attached SIR (SF-33 Cover Sheet-page 1, pages 2 through 66, and 4 Attachments). All questions /inquires must be provided in writing to Anna M. Marinaro at anna.marinaro@faa.gov, not later than July 9, 2007 by 2:00 P.M., local time. Proposals are due no later than July 19, 2007, at 2:00 P.M., local time.

The spare parts kits will consist of all items necessary to produce a robotic system and will be supported by a Bill of Materials listing the bidders part numbers, O EM part numbers, and unit price for each item.  A spreadsheet will be delivered via E-mail to all auction participants prior to the start of the auction to facilitate bid submissions.  This spreadsheet will be in Microsoft Excel format and have parameters set to allow for range pricing at larger quantities and will be used to establish the ceiling amount of the resulting IDIQ contract and the pricing structure for future delivery orders.

The concentration of some of these elements and Strontum  in particular can be used as indicators of temperature. The University of Miami will sample approximately 50 years of growth at a resolution of 50 samples a year. This resolution is necessary to retrieve an accurately estimate of annual temperature variability. This year there will be continued  work on two corals from St Croix., and will analyze 25 years at a resolution of 40 samples a  year. The University will measure geochemical and coral growth proxy indicators for temperature and salinity in coral skeletons from the corals collected St Croix. These will be compared to corals from the southern Lesser Antilles. All corals will be used to 1) reconstruct salinity, 2) compare response of oxygen isotopes and Strontum/Calcium in three different corals. 3) calibrate using existing Sea Surface Temperature records. Strontum/Calcum  and stable isotopic records and interpreted salinity and temperature records from the US Virgin Islands.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric, Administration/NESDIS intends to negotiate with the University of Texas Austin, TX for the continuation of climate studies using massive corals in the Caribbean sector of the tropical Atlantic Ocean. This is a collaborative effort between scientists from Nova Southeastern University, University of Miami, and the University of South Florida. The previous phases focused on generating proxy climate records from coral skeletons from the Florida Keys. A new suite of coral cores were recovered from La Parguera, Puerto Rico. All of this previous work has focused in the coral Montastraea spp, but recent work has begun to explore the coral Siderastraea spp. For its potential as a climate recorder. The UT portion of this years study will include stable isotopic and elemental ratio determinations on a subset of corals samples from the Dry Tortugas.
Deliverables will focus on Strontum/calcium and stable isotopic records and interpreted salinity and temperature records from the following: Dry Tortugas, and Single, normalized and bias-corrected record that matches the variance of the coral proxy temperatures with one instrumental record, using in situ records such as the C-MAN data, Reynolds data, or local thermistor data from Harold  Hudson.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, (USDOC) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, MI intends to award a sole source purchase order, for a base period and four option years to the Freshwater Benthic Services, Mr. Michael Winnell in Petoskey, MI to identify Oligochactes and Chironomids from Lake Michigan and Lake Erie.
As part of a long term monitoring effort in Lake Michigan, and a study to assess ecological impacts of hypoxia in Lake Erie, benthic organisms were collected over various time and space scales in both lakes.  These organisms were counted and separated into various taxonomic groups at GLERL. Two groups, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae, need to be further identified to the genus or species level.  Personnel at GLERL do not have the time and/or expertise to do the identifications.  Mr.Winnell of Freshwater Benthic Services, Inc. has been identifying Oligochaeta and Chironomidae for over 30 years and is especially familiar with species present in Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes.  He has published a monograph documenting all the chironomid species found in the Great Lakes.  ?Unique skills? are acquired by taxonomists only after long term experience and familiarity with species characters, morphological variations, and comparative distinctions.  Species are then easily and efficiently identified, and a typical specimens duly recognized.  In the Great Lakes, there are over 200 species of chironomids and over 90 species of oligochaetes.
The long term monitoring project in Lake Michigan has been ongoing since 1980 and Mr. Winnell has provided identifications of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae since the project was initiated.  Both groups contain species that are excellent indicators of environmental change but only if identified to the genus or species level.  Consistency in identifications is essential since any change in species composition must be regarded as a response to environmental conditions and not to the person making the identifications. Mr. Winnel has a unique knowledge of the species. The Government does not know of any other source that has the long term experience and familiarity with the species character, morphological variations and comparative distinctions. This experience and knowledge is critical for the collection and analysis of data consistency in the data collected; and ensuring that changed conditions can be easily detected.
Anticipated performance period is date of award through September 30, 2008 with four option years when additional funds become available. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Firms must demonstrate they have extensive experience in gathering the same or similar data from species in Lake Michigan and Lake Erie. Demonstrate their familiarity with the oligochactes and chironomids species and their ability to identify these species to the genus or species level.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications, and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above.

Performance Work Statement
Project to Develop a Web-based Guide on Access Board Facility Guidelines

The U.S. Access Board, an independent Federal agency, develops and maintains accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).  These guidelines contain detailed criteria for the design, construction, and alteration of the broad range of facilities covered by regulations implementing these laws.  The ADA requires access to places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities, while the ABA applies to facilities that are federally funded.  In 2004, the Access Board completed a comprehensive review and update of these guidelines.  The revised ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines (the ?2004 Guidelines?) include new and revised provisions for accessibility and establish a more uniform level of access under both laws.   A new format and harmonization with the model codes has also been accomplished in the new document.

The 2004 Accessibility Guidelines contain design specifications for a wide range of building elements and spaces, including entrances, ramps, parking, restrooms, and telephones, among others.  As the basis for mandatory design standards, they are used by architects and designers, code officials, builders, advocates and others across the nation.  Proper and effective compliance requires that these professionals have a clear understanding of the scoping and technical provisions and easy access to guidance that explains the requirements and specifications and clarifies the rationale behind them.

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop a Dissolution Actuated Valve Sampler. Engineers at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a sampling device which can collect uncontaminated discrete fluid samples without utilizing the assistance of a mast or messenger device.  The sampler operates passively to eliminate the need for any additional pumps or vacuums. The sampler is both opened and closed within the fluid at the desired sample level; this ensures there is no mixing between fluid layers. Since the sampler is sealed before exiting the fluid it may be washed prior to retrieval thereby reducing any exposure hazards to the operator. Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in Licensing this invention or participating in a Funds-In CRADA only.

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop a Magnetic Torque Wrench. Engineers at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed the Magnetic Torque Wrench to provide immediate and clearly recognizable feedback to the operator once a preset torque limit has been reached. Its unique construction makes it ideal for use in environments where traditional beam and click or electronic torque wrenches are inappropriate (i.e. wet, caustic, noisy etc).  The torque settings for tightening and loosening can be simultaneously and independently controlled, allowing for smoother transition of operation. The design of the wrench is robust enough so that no accidental shifts in settings will be caused by ordinary handling.  Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information for planning purposes. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The United States Navy Test Pilot School (USNTPS) has established a need and a set of desired capabilities for a helicopter to support their Rotary Wing Test Pilot Curriculum. The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify if a commercial off the shelf helicopter will be able to meet these needs, with little or no modifications being needed. As a top level summary of some of the required system capabilities, the air vehicle should be capable of meeting the following needs:

1.	Aircraft g-load envelope zero to plus 2.5g for normal loadings, airspeeds, and operating altitudes
2.	Un-refueled endurance of at least 2.0 hours
3.	Have a glass cockpit with Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Radar Altimeter. 
4.	Operations in Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
5.	Accommodation of an Electro-Optical Sensor
6.	Have irreversible flight controls

The USNTPS and PMA-207 are sponsoring an Analysis of Options (AoO) to fill their Rotary Wing needs. To support the AoO, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is conducting a market survey to obtain industry input relative to its capabilities to satisfy the USNTPS needs. 

The data is to evaluate the candidate helicopter??s potential to perform missions in support of the United States Navy Test Pilot School (USNTPS) Rotary Wing Curriculum.  In addition to data on the candidate aircraft, any background that can be provided to evaluate the weight and performance impacts of any modifications that may be required to be fully responsive. The scope of the development effort required to perform the modifications including estimated development cost and schedule, would be useful.  

Industry is requested to provide supporting data to the AoO by answering the following questions with respect to each candidate aircraft.  Please identify to what standard each attribute is qualified, or applicable configuration or conditions for the information provided.  If the capability available from the production aircraft differs from that in the question, describe what level of capability is available without modification. Multiple entries from a single vendor are acceptable and encouraged. 

Note that several questions deal with operations at a Standard USNTPS loading configuration. This load condition is defined as: 2 Pilots @ 200 lbs each, 1 flight test engineer @ 200 lbs (in a seated position to observe the cockpit), crew equipment @ 20 lbs, data acquisition package @ 100 lbs, and fuel reserve of 20 min at max endurance speed at SL. 

Please include in your response information addressing:

1.	Provide a precise description of the current production aircraft (Responses should include, but not be limited to these areas of interest: rotor system, number of engines, provisions for crew compartment environmental control, minimum and maximum number of occupants, and landing gear configuration).

2.	What is the aircraft weight empty and operating weight empty (includes core avionics, crew, etc.)?

3.	What is the aircraft useable fuel capacity, and unusable fuel?

4.	What is the aircraft design gross weight and maximum structural design gross weight? What are the center of gravity limits and the impact of operations at USNTPS standard load configuration for operations at Sea Level/103?a deg F and 5,000 ft density altitude? 

5.	What is the maximum gross weight for Hover In Ground Effect (HIGE) and Hover Out of Ground Effect (HOGE), at Sea Level/Standard Day and Sea Level/103?a deg F?

This supersedes Solicitation Number: Reference Number ? N002597046SS01. The product category includes catheters (drainage, thoracic, those with trocars, etc), drains (penrose, jackson pratt, flat, etc), and drainage systems (pleurevac, hemovac, j-vac, dry/wet suction, etc) used to drain blood and fluids from wounds and incisions in the body after trauma or surgical procedures.  Due to the specificity of products within the category, a multiple RIA award is possible.  

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.
 
The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is January 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.

34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  The responses will be reviewed by the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

Phase II.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 10 business days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (10th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.1 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.1 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southwest Region.  Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  However, alternate (tiered) pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection.

In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is Mar 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.

34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of the technical criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTF). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A deadline will be specified to vendors for the arrival of the shipment to the MTFs. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices could be excluded from RIA award consideration.

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one to five where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.1 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.1 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region.  Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  However, alternate (tiered) pricing proposals will not be evaluated as part of the selection.

Usage comes from the Quinault Lodge, two Forest Service campgrounds and a trailhead parking area, several intermittently used homes on the system, and visitors to the Quinault Ranger Station.  Use varies significantly throughout the year.  The plant operator is responsible for plant adjustments to maintain efficient operation of the plant.  Automatic and manual monitoring assists in maintaining efficient plant operation. 
Critical systems within the plant have been duplexed for redundancy to allow repairs to be made without shutting down the plant.  In addition, the controls have been designed to allow human control of critical systems in the event of a Programmable Logic Computer (PLC) failure. The sewage plant and primary pump station No. 1 have backup generators and automatic transfer switches to maintain power during outages.  Other pump stations will accept manually connected generators.
The wastewater treatment plant is a Membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR) facility that utilizes a membrane filtration package manufactured by Zenon Corporation. The designed flow rates are: 24,000 gpd average annual flow; 40,000 maximum monthly flow; 80,000 gpd peak day flow; and 360,000 gpd peak instantaneous flow.
This plant is operated under a Waste Discharge Permit issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology (WA DOE) (Permit No. ST6091). The permit mandates effluent standards. The permit identifies the plant type as a Membrane Bio-Reactor.  The responsible operator in charge of day-to-day operations shall be a Class II operator.  An operator certified as Class I shall be in charge during all regularly scheduled shifts.
The government may proceed to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) Solicitation.  This solicitation will result in an Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract for one year, with two (2) one-year options.  The contract performance period is from October 01, 2007, to September 30, 2008.  The government estimated value is between $100,000.00 and $150,000.00 per year.  

The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  For additional information contact Mr. Miley Sutherland, Contract Specialist, at 360-956-2471.

Of particular interest, are comments about potential contractors ability to produce/design the software and overall business capabilities. Army aviation requires the capability to take multiple data inputs from disparate aviation platform systems, turn this into usable information and graphically display it to users. This requires a software and hardware system that enables quick analysis of flight data and creation of high fidelity, 3D graphical representations for after action review. It generates a time-synchronized visualization of the flight that is data driven and fully interactive. It incorporates numerous user-selectable display format s to provide a wide range of data reporting, charting and informational data. The graphical representations require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission that reflect s aggregated data by time, unit, and/or person.     This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based units. COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific anim ation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  Examples of desired display capabilities are: "	Aircraft flight path oriented with ground and map display "	Aircraft attitude "	Cockpit instrumentation "	Flight control position The PM Aviation Systems seeks information, comments, suggestions and literature/brochures from developers/providers of this type of COTS applications that would satisfy the above requirement.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) has a requirement for a Joint Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Reconnaissance set of missin specific kits that provide the capability to conduct a dismounted reconnaissance mission in a suspected CBRN, Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC), and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) contaminated environment. It shall provide detection, identification, and warning on the presence or absence of contamination. When contamination is found there is a need to sample, collect, and package contaminates for laboratory analysis for confirmatory testing.  CBRN reconnaiss ance teams require a dismounted CBRN equipment package that is light, man portable, and tailorable to be transportable worldwide by rail, sealift and landing craft, or be transportable by aircraft and externally lifted by helicopter.  Additionally, these C BRN teams are required to conduct dismounted CBRN reconnaissance in an austere environment and possess an organic capability to provide personal protection against CBRN hazards.  The CBRN team must be able to conduct operational decontamination.  Future re connaissance capabilities require detection of hazardous materials, the ability to carry out traditional CBRN reconnaissance, and the ability to perform the initial evaluation of a CBRN site assessment (SA).  The CBRN teams require protection from the full  range of CBRN threats in order to conduct their expanded mission.  Reconnaissance units are expected to conduct presumptive identification, analysis, collection and transportation of samples.  Key Performance Parameters required are: 1) Detection and Iden tification of CBRN/TIM hazards in a tactical operational environment.  The probability of detection and identification must have a likelihood of 80%;  2) Deployable in Desert and Tropical regions; and 3) Individual Protection Equipment with a level of prot ection that meets operational mission periods for more than 40 minutes. Reliability factors include: At least 90% probability of completing a 72-hour period without experiencing an Operational Mission Failure.  Maintainability factors include:  90% of all field level maintenance actions to restore loss of mission essential functions must be completed by the operator within 15 minutes. The CBRN set of mission specific kits is designed to be carried on various platforms.  Specific Army Light Brigade Combat te ams may carry the equipment on an M1102 or similar trailer chassis.   Sensors or collective protection are not likely to be integrated into platforms.  This dismountable equipment package will allow light forces to tailor it to provide the capability requi red to Army Light Brigade Combat Teams and support CBRN SA  missions.  In the assessment role, the equipment will be used to detect, identify, collect, and sample potential CBRN materials obtained from buildings, bunkers, caves, ships, containers, and othe r areas that are either inaccessible or impractical to employ a mounted reconnaissance vehicle (NBCRV) or armored reconnaissance system (NBCRS). Due to specialized mission requirements, personnel may be exposed to low oxygen levels, confined space environm ents, and environments with high concentrations of filter penetrating TIMs. The Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) will consist of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), which allows personnel to operate in low oxygen /confined space environments. The JNBCRS 2 program will follow a modified commercially available/Non-Developmental Item acquisition strategy.  JNBCRS 2 will consist of two major components: a modular container with internal storage and the CBRN mission package.  The set of mission spec ific kits will consist of Government and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS and COTS) current available technology.  The hand-held devices will enable the NBC recon naissance team to detect and identify blister and nerve agent vapors in buildings, tunnels, and caves.  The team will have the ability to detect both liquid and vapor concentrations of chemical agents.  A hand-held radiation meter capable of vehicle mounte d or dismounted operations with the ability to detect and measure the gamma dose-rate and gamma and neutron cumulative dose from fallout, radiological contamination, and nuclear detonations and a handheld radiation spectrometer to monitor isotope identific ation and spectrum analysis will be part of the mission package for radiological/nuclear detection, identification and monitoring during dismounted CBRN reconnaissance.  A handheld detection and identification capability is provided for hazardous airborne TIC/TIM contaminants and chemical warfare agents (CWA) to characterize organic and inorganic chemicals and/or chemical families.  A handheld solid and liquid detection and identification capability for the analysis of toxic industrial chemicals, environmen tal contaminants and chemical warfare agents compares the analysis against an onboard database library of known chemicals.  In addition, a portable TIC/TIM identification capability is needed to identify volatile organic compounds, toxic industrial chemica ls (TICs) and chemical warfare agents (CWAs).  A single handheld gas monitor with multiple integrated sensors; capable of monitoring oxygen concentration that automatically warns when oxygen concentration is low and is capable of detecting volatile organic  compounds (VOCs) and warns of a lower explosive limit (LEL). For personal protection during dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, there will be suits with a multi-layer composite chemical barrier laminated to provide protection from toxic particles and water-ba sed liquids.  The complete suit consists of gloves, coveralls, safety glasses, face shield and chemical-resistant steel-toe boots.  Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) certified for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) environments with a pressure regulator, locking quick-connector couplings air supply hose(s) will be available.  A Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) equipped with appropriate gas/vapor cartridge(s) to filter all CBRN contaminants by a lightweight battery-powered generator that provides a constant airflow into the wearers face piece.  This Provides positive pressure airflow facilitating extended wear without adversely affecting user performance and increases time on target during CBRN SA missions. Decontamination capability for dismounted CBRN reconnaissance operations requires an expedient personnel decontamination system.  This is used to decontaminate agents/ hazards to prevent any further absorption and removing secondary contamination threat. A man portable po wer driven decontamination capability that generates an environmentally friendly decontaminant in a vapor form to decontaminate inaccessible and hard to reach locations is included. A lightweight man-portable decontamination system is used to decontaminate  all known chemical warfare agents and also biological agents as well as toxic industrial chemicals that is carried on person and/or mounted inside a vehicle with a decontamination solution.  A portable decontamination shower, which is fully collapsible, h as quick-connects, a durable privacy enclosure and semi-transparent roof.  It has a water storage bag, with associated hoses and drains.  It is transportable and stored in two vinyl bags.  Estimated set-up time is five minutes.  The following sample, marki ng, and collection capabilities will be part of the mission package:  A chemical and biological sampling kit that is capable of collecting samples of powder, liquid, and soil materials.  An antibody-based assay sampling kit is used to presumptively identif y Biological Warfare (BW) agents with a collection capability of identifying ten different BW threat agents with the capability equivalent to or better than HHA  and Department of Defense Biological Sampling Kit.  A handheld meteorological device for collection, use and transferring of meteorological data that monitors (at a minimum) air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and barometric pr essure. A marking capability for CBRN hazards complies with the Standard NATO Agreement (STANAG) 2002.  This kit provides ability to mark a contaminated area and identify clear lanes through a contaminated area. Companies which have the capability to integ rate as well as provide the equipment should respond to this announcement.  Interested companies should provide company name, address, telephone, email contact, and a capabilities statement containing a summary describing their technical capabilities, manu facturing capacity, and information on their past performance on Government contracts.  Please limit your document to two pages. Responses to this survey must be submitted electronically within 15 calendar days from the date of this notice to john.jump@us. army.mil and Michael.bucci@us.army.mil.   All information collected will be used by the Government for planning purposes only.

<SUBJECT>36 -- TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY Materials Modification Technology License
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, one of the lead research and development laboratories for the
Department of Energy's pulsed energy needs, is looking for one or more companies to engage in
commercialization of Sandia's technology for modification of materials by the application of
pulsed ion beams. The technology is made up of a repetitively pulsed ion beam system with a
high energy pulsed power source and an ion beam generator capable of producing high voltage
ion beams (0.25-2.5 MeV) made up of a single species at 1-1000kW average power and over
extended operating cycles (108cycles). Irradiating materials with such high energy, repetitively
pulsed ion beams can yield surface treatments including localized high temperature anneals
(even to melting) followed by rapid thermal quenching to achieve novel and typically
unachievable physical characteristics in the near surface layer of materials.
It is expected that successful partners will license Sandia's existing technology and will
effectively commercialize the technology without assistance from Sandia. Because of this
expectation, potential partners must document their ability to move similar products to market
and demonstrate they have the resources and expertise to design, develop, manufacture, market,
and service fully functional ion beam systems.
Sandia anticipates granting one or more licenses, up to and including exclusive rights, to
qualified partners. Sandia licenses typically include up-front fees, royalties, annual minimums,
and performance milestones. Rights are available to one issued patent (USP #RE37,537,
"Method and apparatus for altering material") related to the pulsed ion beam apparatus.
To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to
Paul Smith by August 29,2007 at: Sandia National Laboratories,MS 0114, P.O. Box 5800,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0114. Fax (505) 844-8011. Please indicate the date and title
of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm will successfully bring the
materials modification system to market. This is not a federal government procurement and
therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia's selection process.

<SUBJECT>99 -- This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following products to the P/L:

Cartridge, Toner, Remanufactured
7510-00-NSH-0075
7510-00-NSH-0076
7510-00-NSH-0077
7510-00-NSH-0078
7510-00-NSH-0079

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Remanufactured Toner Cartridges to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

HP OEM C7115X		HP OEM C4127X
HP OEM C3909A		HP OEM C8061X
HP OEM C4096A

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing remanufactured toner cartridges to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 29, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-52, Proposers' Day for Scalable Network Monitoring Program
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of the BAA07-52, Scalable Network Monitoring (SNM) program on Thursday, August 16th, 2007 at System Planning Corporation, Suite 3001, 3601 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the SNM program; promote additional discussion on this topic; and provide a forum for potential proposers to investigate their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the SNM program is to develop new approaches to monitoring computer networks independent of the network size.  The envisioned size of the Global Information Grid (GIG) and use of IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) present new challenges to information assurance.  At the same time threats are shrinking in size and signature, significantly reducing their equivalent "signal-to-noise" ratio.  As a result many conventional approaches to defending our networks will not be sustainable.  This project will explore new network-based approaches to monitoring computer networks that provide maximum coverage with performance independent of the network size and computational costs that remain a constant (or decreasing) fraction of the computational power of the total network being defended.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT 5:00 pm EDT Wednesday, August 8th, 2007 at the following website:   http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/bti.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 80 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.  The Proposers' Day will be unclassified.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all attendees must be US Citizens and are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  The completed Citizenship Form must be faxed to:  Julie Ard, System Planning Corporation, fax 703-351-8776, phone 703-351-8481, email Julia.ard.ctr@darpa.mil no later than 5:00 pm EDT Wednesday, August 8th, 2007.  The document is available for download at the registration website.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.

II.BACKGROUND: The Civil Rights Center (CRC) is the only entity within the Department of Labor that enforces various Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit discrimination in DOL financially assisted and conducted programs and activities. One of the CRCs primary goals is to make sure that its customers, the recipients of DOL financial assistance and DOL program agencies, have the essential information, materials, and training that will enable them to adequately comply with Federal equal opportunity and nondiscrimination laws and regulations.

Technical literature must be submitted for â€œequalâ€ products offered for the Government to perform a technical evaluation.  No further request will be made to obtain required literature and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration.  Award will be made relative to best overall value.  Best value may include, but is not limited to: past performance, technical capability, quality, probable life, warranty, maintainability, and price.  Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.

STANDARD:  Customer complaints shall not exceed the thresholds cited above for each performance objective.  The COTR shall calculate the recommended deductions based on the following procedures and forward to the Contracting Officer (KO) for action.

DEDUCTION FORMULA:  For determination of deduction of payment due to unacceptable service, a flat rate of $50.00 will apply under this methodology:

1.	Assume a total contract value and maximum service of $24,000.00.
2.	Total monthly value is $2,000.00.
3.	Assume contractor has 20 monthly tasking (room reservations)
4.	Assume 2 defects are discovered above the allowable performance requirement during a given month.

Total Monthly Value:				$2.000.00
Reduction for unacceptable services:		_$50.00
Total deduction:				$ 100.00 ($50.00 x 2)

PROCEDURES: Any USCG reservist that observes unacceptable services, either incomplete or not performed, for any of the above performance objectives should immediately contact the COTR and the COTR will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint.  The COTR will consider the customer complaint valid upon receipt from the customer.  The COTR should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COTR if not corrected. The COTR will consider customer complaints as resolved unless notified otherwise by the customer.  The COTR shall verbally notify the Contractor?s Quality Control Inspector (QCI) to pick up the written customer complaint.  The QCI will be given two hours after verbal notification to correct the unacceptable performance.  If the QCI disagrees with the complaint after investigation of the site and challenges the validity of the complaint, the QCI will notify the COTR.  The COTR will conduct an investigation to determine the validity of the complaint.  If the COTR determines the complaint as invalid, he will document the written complaint of the findings and notify the customer.  The COTR will retain the annotated copy of the written complaint for his/her files.  If after investigation the COTR determines the complaint as valid, the COTR will inform the QCI and the QCI will be given an additional hour to correct the defect.  A defect will not be recorded if proper and timely correction of the unacceptable condition(s) is accomplished. The QCI shall return the written customer complaint document, properly completed with actions taken, to the COTR, who will file the complaint for monitoring future recurring performance.

II.	BACKGROUND

The Clara Barton Museum project involves the restoration, rehabilitation and interpretation of a mid-19th century commercial building in Washington, D.C. that served as Clara Barton?s apartment from 1861 to 1864 as well as her Missing Soldiers Office of the U.S. Army from 1864 to1868.  

Located on the D.C. Heritage Trail from Civil War to Civil Rights, the Clara Barton office and apartment building is most significant as the place where Clara Barton lived during the Civil War when she served soldiers on the surrounding battlefields and after the War created the first Missing in Action investigative federal agency.  The building is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Pennsylvania Avenue Historic Site.

During the 1970s and 80s, The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) assembled Square 457-C for residential and office space redevelopment.  PADC was unable to market and sell the property before the organization was abolished in 1996.  The GSA/National Capital Region (GSA/NCR) received the PADC real estate holdings for final disposition, along with all site research and documentation.

In November 1997, soon after assuming control of PADC?s holdings, GSA discovered artifacts above the 3rd floor ceiling that were confirmed as the personal property associated with Barton's occupancy of the building during the 1850s and 1860s. The objects found at 437 7th Street, NW included a tin sign stating Missing Soldiers Office, 3rd Story, room 9.  Miss Clara Barton.  Most of the other objects appeared to be Civil War documents and masculine property which may belong to Mr. Edward Shaw, a friend of Barton's.  On investigation, GSA learned that original walls, floors, woodwork and wallpapers likely dating to Barton's occupancy had survived as well.  

In the aftermath of the discovery, GSA developed an offering of sale ?Request for Proposals (RFP), that added requirements for restoration and rehabilitation of the Clara Barton Apartment and Missing Soldiers? Office building.  The RFP stated that the Government wanted the Clara Barton portions of the building to remain federal property and used in a to-be-determined museum-related fashion?.  The RFP was issued in September 1998.  

The RFP required the following work to be completed at the offeror's expense: 

Rehabilitation of the building's exterior envelope, including the removal of the 1984 facade and reconstruction of a replication of the original 1855 design. Rehabilitation of all interior spaces to meet current building systems, fire, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility code requirements in all areas, all floors, except for the Clara Barton office/apartment, including the access hallway on the third floor and the original entrance and staircase at the southernmost end of the existing building, which was to be given special care as a conservation/restoration zone.  

Restoration of the entrance and staircase to their original state and function.  Restoration and treatment of the Clara Barton office/apartment on the third floor as a unique space in accordance with Government mandates, including the creation of a perpetual Federal preservation easement, to be held and monitored by GSA.  

GSA selected Jefferson at Penn Quarter, LLP a subsidiary of JPI Inc., Irving, Texas, as developer of the PADC parcel incorporating the preserved Clara Barton Apartment and Missing Soldiers? Office into construction of new rental housing units behind the 1850s boarding house. GSA retained an easement in perpetuity for the approximately 4000 square feet identified in the sales agreement.  The easement preserved the entire 3000 square foot third floor and 1000 square feet of the building?s first floor as museum restoration, interpretation and support spaces. 
 
Using funds set aside from the property sale in fulfillment of GSA?s compliance obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, GSA is now preparing to conserve the third floor and renovate the first floor reception and office spaces.  Studies prerequisite to museum conservation and restoration have been completed.  Conservation and restoration design drawings and specifications for the work are complete.  

GSA envisions developing the Clara Barton museum in a similar fashion to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, maintaining the unique sense of discovery that the spaces offer by preserving original materials in place to the greatest extent possible and carefully toning in replica finishes to blend with original, aged finishes that survive throughout the spaces, rather than restore the spaces to a like new appearance at the expense of the authentic discovery.

GSA's next steps are to explore partnership options for operation of the museum space, concurrent with artifact cataloguing, to ensure that planning for museum conservation and interpretation is informed by knowledge of the material available for display.  GSA intends to invite comments and suggestions from stakeholder/advisors who participated in the post-discovery panel discussions leading to creation of the preservation easement as part of the commercial redevelopment.  The purpose of this model is to help stakeholders visualize the restored space as GSA intends to interpret it and interest appropriate nonprofits in entering into a partnership with GSA to operate the museum.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This Announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number for this request is Q947107A166 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This RFQ will be awarded as a firm-fixed price Order for Commercial Services, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is set-aside for Small Business and estimated not to exceed $25,000 for the first year. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541620-Environmental Consulting Services and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular. The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284 has a requirement for the following services: To determine the "Status and Distribution of the Marbled Murrelet in North Cascades National Park Service Complex". All questions shall be directed to Joyce E. Bolin, Contracting Officer at 360-856-7219 or joyce_bolin@nps.gov. This project is intended to be a one year acquisition with two follow-up years as proposed options to collect baseline data to assess the status of Marbled Murrelets in suitable nesting habitat within NOCA. Specific objectives are to determine Murrelet occupancy in selected drainages that meet the criteria as nesting habitat, identify specific portions of the watersheds being used by Murrelets, and obtain a current minimum population estimate in each of these drainages. The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a small diving seabird that breeds along the Pacific coast of North America. Murrelets forage almost exclusively in the near-shore marine environment and fly inland to nest in the canopy of mature and old-growth conifer forests. Baseline inventories to assess the status of all federally listed vertebrate species in NOCA (8) have been conducted except for the Marbled Murrelet. This 3-year project (one base year & two option years) proposes to conduct radar surveys in selected watersheds that meet the criteria as Murrelet nesting habitat to determine Murrelet presence and obtain a current minimum population estimate. Where Murrelets are documented using radar surveys, we will conduct ground surveys, using the Pacific Seabird Group Marbled Murrelet Survey Protocol, to gather site-specific information to determine where Murrelets are present in these drainages. If Murrelets are not found using the radar surveys (FY2008), then radar surveys will be repeated in FY2009. If no Murrelets are found in FY2009, then project work for FY2010 ground surveys will not be needed.  See www.nps.gov and locate North Cascades National Park for information about our location. Problem Statement - Of the 8 federally listed animal species known to use habitats in and/or adjacent to NOCA, baseline inventories to determine presence and status have been conducted for all except the marbled murrelet.  Currently, only 2 incidental observations document murrelet presence in NOCA.  However, U.S. Forest Service and Washington Department of Natural Resources surveys conducted west of NOCA in the 1990s documented murrelets using suitable nesting habitat in many of their low elevation drainages that flow out of NOCA (North Fork Nook-sack River, Baker River, Bacon Creek, Cascade River).  They documented Murrelet presence during the breeding season within 5 km of the park boundary in all of the above mentioned drainages.  Though much of NOCA is beyond 84 km from saltwater, several major drainages with substantial low-elevation old-growth forest (approximately 68,000 acres) do provide murrelet nesting and roosting habitat within western sections of the park. This project purposes to gather information on the status of the marbled murrelet in NOCA to insure we manage park lands for the protection of murrelets and to meet our responsibilities to participate in the Murrelet recovery program.   Methods - This project is a firm-fixed price contract for one year, with two option years, as needed, depending upon the results of each year's survey. In FY2008, radar surveys will be conducted in selected watersheds (Chilliwack River, Baker River, and several small drainages flowing directly in the main stem Skagit River) that meet the criteria as Murrelet nesting habitat to determine Murrelet presence. Radar surveys will be used to determine if Murrelets are present within the selected drainages and provide an index of abundance for that selected drainage. If murrelets are not documented in FY2008, radar surveys will be repeated in FY2009, though site selection and the number of times a site is surveyed may change slightly.  If murrelets are documented in specific drainages in FY2008 using radar, then audio-visual ground surveys will be conducted in FY2009 and FY2010.   Using the Pacific Seabird Group Marbled Murrelet Survey Protocol (Mack et al. 2003), each drainage where murrelets were documented in FY2008 will be surveyed. The intensive ground-based surveys incorporate a three-step process: (1) Design the survey, including habitat assessment, defining the survey area, and establishing survey sites and stations. (2) Conduct survey visits in accordance with the protocol to determine if Murrelets occur at each site.  (3) Interpret the activity observed to classify the site as probable absence, presence, or occupied. All fieldwork will begin in April and continue through the breeding season until the first week of August.  An annual report detailing the season's accomplishments will be submitted each year and a final report detailing results of surveys will be submitted in the fall of FY2009.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented, with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-18, effective on June 30, 2007.  This announcement is considered an unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS Code is 541611. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ No. 07-0138), and is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The EEOC contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed price type contract for Consulting Services. Period of performance will be 60 days from date of award. Background: A two-year pilot for a national contact center (NCC) was implemented in 2004 by contractor Vangent, Inc. (formerly Pearson Government Solutions, Inc).  The objectives were to improve customer service and customer access to the EEOC using state-of-the-art technology and industry best practices; improve human capital effectiveness; and deliver accurate and consistent services to our customers throughout the nation. As a result of a Commission meeting on July 13, 2006, the Office of Field Programs (in coordination with the Office of Information Technology) was directed to focus on nine action items to bring the NCC to full implementation.  Currently, more than 70,000 people call the NCC?s toll-free number each month, while over 3000 send emails to the NCC.  At least 35 percent of the calls are resolved by the interactive voice response (IVR) system while the remaining calls are answered by trained Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) with less than one minute wait time on average.  Intake Questionnaires are mailed to more than 14,000 individuals each month within 7 business days of the call.  Both headquarters and field staff have monitored the quality of the calls and attest to their accuracy and professionalism.  Callers have been assisted in more than 60 languages under a contract that offers language interpretation services in more than 150 languages. At this time the EEOC seeks to migrate the NCC to an in-house environment staffed by federal employees. As a first step in determining a sound, cost-effective plan for the migration effort; the EEOC requires a contractor to complete a study of three proposed configurations for an in-sourced contact center.  Scope: The national contact center migration study involves the following areas:  a)The EEOC requires a contractor to provide three separate cost estimates, migration time estimates, and necessary steps for providing the services NCC currently offers (IVR, Language Line, answering calls for first time callers, providing general information regarding the EEOC and the statutes it enforces, providing information regarding charges filed with the EEOC, performing a preliminary screen of callers, making referrals to other agencies where appropriate, sending out intake questionnaires where appropriate) within EEOC covering both the business and technical components and using market data and industry standards for best practices.  b) Each estimate would be made assuming comparable staffing, processes, technology and equipment, and include the resources EEOC would need to re-establish a comparable operation within the agency.  Estimates should consider using the current EEOC resources where appropriate. c) The three options for which cost estimates are required are:  (1) a decentralized model with staffing/ technology within each of our fifteen Districts (the staffing and technology can be in any of the offices within the District); (2) a time zone (follow the sun) model with staffing/technology within three field office locations; and (3) a centralized model at one location in a low-cost area of the US.  The contractor also shall provide a comprehensive analysis of the positive and negative aspects of each option and a recommendation on the best preferred or ideal model for a contact center that meets EEOC's mission and operational needs. CLIN0001. Cost estimate for migration to decentralized model in 15 districts $__________.  CLIN0002. Cost estimate for migration to "follow-the-sun" model in three locations $_____________. CLIN0003. Cost estimate for centralized model in single location $__________. CLIN0004. A comprehensive analysis of the positive and negative aspects of each option and a recommendation of the best preferred or ideal model to meet EEOC's mission and operational needs including the technical and budget business case to support the recommendation $____________.  Assumptions: Under each of the options examined, federal employees will be used to staff the operations in Government leased space (federal or commercial) and with Government furnished or leased equipment. The Government furnished equipment includes the Customer Relations Management(CRM)application in use at the NCC and the outputs from the system (reports) that are useful to EEOC. The vendor will need to include a comparable CRM application in the three alternatives.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-431-08
<RESPDATE>083107
<ARCHDATE>09152007

<DESC>Collaborations for Development of EPA's ToxCast(TM) Program for Predicting Toxicity>>>>>>>>>>>

Opportunity:
The EPA is interested in finding partners for collaboration on a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to facilitate and expand the development and evaluation of its ToxCast(TM) research program for predicting the toxicity of environmental chemicals.  Researchers at the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) of the Office of Research and Development (ORD) of EPA are developing ToxCast(TM) as an innovative approach building computational models that forecast toxicity based on data from state-of-the-art high-throughput screening (HTS)  bioassays.  (HTS is a system to rapidly and efficiently test large batches of chemicals for bioactivity utilizing robotics and automation applied to molecular biology and cellular assays.)  These hazard predictions should provide EPA's regulatory programs with science-based information helpful in prioritizing chemicals for more detailed toxicological evaluations, and therefore lead to using animal tests more efficiently.  Partnering opportunities with EPA exist to expand the breadth of assays involved in Phase 1, and the breadth of chemicals and assays in Phase 2.  A description of each Phase is provided below.>>>>>>>>>>

To indicate interest:  Please reply to Kathleen Graham at graham.kathleen@epa.gov or 202-564-2678 by August 31, 2007 if you are interested in a partnering on this CRADA.  For more information on CRADAs please see the following website: http://www.epa.gov/osp/ftta.htm>>>>>>>>>>

Overview:
Across EPA programs, there are thousands of environmental chemicals for which limited or insufficient data are available for hazard and risk assessments.  These chemicals include antimicrobial agents, inert pesticide ingredients, high-production-volume chemicals, and drinking water contaminant candidates.  ToxCast(TM) is a five-year research program testing the hypothesis that multi-dimensional evaluation of chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains will yield signatures predictive of toxicity, which can then be used to prioritize chemicals for more detailed toxicological examination.  Information domains include physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities derived from existing structure-activity models, biochemical and cellular properties from HTS assays, genomic analyses of cells, and responses in non-mammalian model organisms.  Signatures will be defined and evaluated by their ability to predict outcomes from existing mammalian toxicity assays.>>>>>>>>>>  

This five-year effort is divided into three phases.  As proof?of-concept, Phase 1 of the program is evaluating more than 300 chemicals in over 400 different bioassays.  The HTS assays are available through an initial $6M investment made by EPA in nine extramural contracts awarded in April 2007.  The contracts have the capacity to assay up to 10,000 chemicals over the five-year period.  In addition, an Interagency Agreement (IAG) was established with the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) to provide access to the novel technologies developed by the NIH Molecular Libraries Initiative.  All these data types will be used to derive predictive signatures based on the known toxicity of the 300 chemicals.  The Phase 1 chemicals are primarily pesticide active ingredients that have been extensively evaluated by traditional toxicity testing, and hence have known properties representative of various phenotypic outcomes (e.g., carcinogenicity; developmental, reproductive and neural toxicity).  Results from the ToxCast(TM) Phase 1 assays are expected in early 2008 and will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and detailed overview of the impact of environmental chemicals upon key cellular activities.  The assays range from characterizing the interactions of chemicals with proteins that regulate and maintain proper cell function, to measuring the response of whole cells, to studying chemical effects in a model organism.  To ensure transparency and collaboration, ToxCast(TM) data will be made publicly available.>>>>>>>>>  

Upon completion and evaluation of the proof of concept, the research program will enter Phase 2 which will focus on the confirmation and expansion of ToxCast(TM) predictive signatures, generating data on up to 1,000 additional chemicals.  In Phase 3, ToxCast(TM) will be applied to the thousands of environmental chemicals requiring prioritization, delivering an affordable, science-based system for categorizing chemicals.  As the ToxCast(TM) database and models develop, so will confidence in predicted toxicity and potential mechanisms useful in refining and reducing the use of animals in toxicity testing.>>>>>>>>>>

Readers should refer to the NCCT website (http://www.epa.gov/ncct/) for more information on the ToxCast(TM) program, or to the article describing "The ToxCast(TM) program for prioritizing toxicity testing of environmental chemicals" published in Toxicological Sciences (Dix et al., 2007, vol. 95, pg. 5-12).>>>>>>>>>>
 
Specifications:
EPA is seeking CRADA partners interested in collaborating on the ToxCast(TM) research program by generating additional HTS data with Phase 1 chemicals, or supporting generation of HTS data with Phase 2 chemicals.  Phase 2 of ToxCast(TM) is projected to involve up to 1,000 additional chemicals representing broader chemical structure and use classes, in order to confirm and expand on the predictive bioactivity signatures developed in Phase 1.  The CRADA is expected to involve multiple partners, including but not limited to non-governmental organizations, private sector companies, academic institutions, and companies with expertise in predictive toxicology.  EPA is also working with other national agencies and international governments through appropriate vehicles in this collaborative process.  Common areas of interest and potential cooperation include:  1) toxicity endpoints of concern; 2) chemicals of concern; 3) toxic modes of action; 4) screening data generation with either a) new assays for common chemicals, or b) new chemicals for common assays; and 5) data management, analysis and sharing.>>>>>>>>>>

52.233-9000 Agency protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. (b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. (c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation ? Commercial Items
(a) The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the product offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance is history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its proposal evaluated for lowest price.  

1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the product offered to meet the Government?s 
requirement.  Technical acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable 
basis.  To be acceptable, the offeror must submit information indicating that the 
Breathable Air System components meet or exceed the minimum technical requirements 
identified above.              

2.   Factor 2 - Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for and record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror?s business like concern for the interests of the customer. 

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfactions and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.

The Government will consider relevant past performance information submitted by the offerors, as well as information obtained from other sources.  Offerors with no relevant past performance or for whom past performance information is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for past performance. 

(b) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposed by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).

(c ) A written notice of award or acceptance of a proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<RESPDATE>081407
<ARCHDATE>10132007
<CONTACT>Beverly Gonzales, 256-876-5326
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number W31P4Q-07-Q-0032 is being issued as a request for quote.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisi tion Circular 2005-18.  The intention of this study is to advance concepts for add-on damping treatments and shock isolation for an Army missile system.  Currently passive type approaches will be investigated utilizing an existing finite element model of t he missile body and seeker head.  Each of the damping approaches will be evaluated for amount of added damping, weight, and complexity.  Task A.  Grommet Parameters.  An isolation technique that has generated success and promise is the use of polymer gromm ets as part of the mounting process of the IMUs.  The small size of the grommets do not significantly increase the volume required for the IMU, which is the result of only isolating the IMU and not any of the electronics or bracket hardware and therefore t he grommet isolation is relatively small.  Currently, urethane and ethylene propylene (EPDM) have been utilized in the grommet design.  The durometer hardness or stiffness of these materials can be adjusted to meet the required isolation frequency.  The co ntractor shall build a finite element model of a grommet design that is currently being utilized in a AMRDEC missile design.  The FEM shall be correlated to current grommet test data.  The test data will be provided by the AMRDEC and shall consist of consi st of laboratory test data and flight test data.  The grommet FEM shall be parameterized such that various material properties and design parameters of the grommet can be optimized for different applications.  The deliverables for Task A shall consist of N ASTRAN FEM and a report documenting the FEM, correlation results, input requirements and optimization procedures and results.  This shall be prepared In Accordance With (IAW) DI-MISC-80711.  Task B.  Apply Constrained Layer Viscoelastic Treatment To IMU Br acket Structures.  A design for a constrained layer viscoelastic treatment shall be proposed and analyzed using the finite element model of the IMU Bracket.  This viscoelastic design will include location of attachment, geometric size of attachment, thickn ess of materials, and selection of a viscoelastic material.  The viscoelastic treatment works best in regions of the structure with high strain energy.  Therefore, the first step will be to scrutinize the fundamental modes of the bracket model to determine  promising regions for attachment of the viscoelastic treatment.  From there, a trade study on the remaining parameters of the treatment (size of treatment, thicknesses of viscoelastic and constraining layer, and material selection) will be undertaken to o ptimize the amount of damping achieved in the structure.  This will be undertaken by modifying the finite element model to account for the damping treatment and evaluating the amount of added damping using the Modal Strain Energy Method. Two types of viscoelastic damping treatments shall be considered.  In the first, the host structure is left unmodified and the damping treatment is simply added-on to the interior or exterior of the host structure.  The second viscoelastic treatment utiliz es the fact that the missile body is a composite material.  This allows the possibility of embedding the viscoelastic material as another layer in the composite layup.  The contractor shall develop prototype bracket hardware with and without the constraine d layer viscoelastic treatment applied.  Laboratory tests shall then be applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique under shock and vibration environments.  The de liverables shall be prototype bracket hardware.  The data deliverables shall be NASTRAN FEM, and a report documenting the FEA modeling techniques and results, and laboratory tests and results.  This shall be prepared IAW DI-MISC-80711.  The Office of the Assistance Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site to capture all direct labor hours and direct labor dollars incurred by prime contractors and subcontra ctors required for performance of this contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions posed asking for clarification of the specifications listed in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation:

1)  Our cameras communicate with the host computer via a fiber optically linked PCI card.    Will you accept this instead of USB2.0?  All software for operating the PCI card is provided.

Yes.

2) Will you specify a dark current value?

0.02 e-/ per-pixel per-second

3) The vendor of the CCD may take longer than 60 days simply to deliver the CCD for the camera.    Will you take this limitation into consideration and if necessary extend the 60 day delivery requirement?

No.

4) Do you anticipate any vendors having an existing, currently available, standard, commercial, off the shelf solution to these requirements ?

There are at least two off the shelf solutions that we know of.

5) Would you consider a custom developed camera that meets your requirements ?

We prefer off the shelf solutions, but given the correct price a custom device would be fine too.

6) What is your expected leadtime for a delivery ?  You state within 60 days of order.  When do you expect order placement ?

As stated in the solicitation, delivery shall be provided no later than 60 days after receipt of an order.  The order will be placed no later than September 21, 2007, which is the end of our fiscal year.

7) I'm interested in responding to your quote as referenced above but am unsure as to what software you would require for line item 12. Do you have a particular software requirement?

Every camera feature should be operable via a GUI based software package, and in addition we expect to be able to control the camera via labview.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged and remain in full force and effect.  The due date for receipt of quotes remains unchanged.

2. Post the Questions/Answers 

Questions/Answers
1.	Customer stated that would like to be consistent in their materials that they currently have on site. They are using AT&T 110 patch panels, AT&T jacks, etc.  Would it be possible for the customer to provide us with the part numbers of those items?
We do not know what the part numbers are. The vendor hired to wire this building was told that we wanted 110 blocks for the voice and 110 blocks with the amphenal connector for the data, and they apparently found them, the same for the jacks. 

2.	Customer stated that they are currently using CAT3 cable for their voice and the bid states that they want to upgrade to CAT5e for voice and data.  Some of the project calls for reusing existing wires.  Do you want to retain the CAT3 in the locations that the cables are to be reused?

Yes, we currently have CAT3 cabling for voice, and if we can still use the current wiring, we would rather use the current than spend it on all new cable runs.  If we have to run new cable runs, per our National Office, we are to install CAT5E, so therefore all NEW cable runs will be CAT5E, Voice & Data.

3.	What brand of face plate and jacks?
The furniture company is Hayworth, and the type of jacks will be, is a snap-in, in one of the panels.  Do not know the brand name.  Jacks may have to be special ordered

4.	What kind of floor racks?
The racks will be 19" x 7 (black) floor mounted four posts with wire management.  What is required also is ladder racking at the top.  This information is stated in the SOW. 

5.	Hours of work
Work will be done during normal, after hours and also weekends.  This information is stated in the SOW.

6.	Some of the re-runs may not be reachable to new locations, if new cable is needed in these 291 re-runs, how do you want us to quote for re-runs? 

Prepare the quote in accordance with the SOW where we have 291 re-runs and 175 new cable runs.  The vendor who is awarded will do another site survey to obtain more information for this project



7.	Do you have any specific format for the quote?

Please see Attachment A of the solicitation.

8.	Is the closing date extended?

The closing day is still August 3, 2007.


9.	Unclear on total number of new cables vs. cables that will be re-used, customer could not give definitive answer and would not provide a written cut plan.

Submit the quote based on the SOW, 291 re-runs and 175 new cable runs.  The vendor who is awarded will do another site survey to obtain more information for this project

<DESC>Below are some more technical questions from vendors along with answers.  Important information is at the end of this modification.  This modification will also be posted on http://www.yuma.army.mil/contracting/ under RFQ W81R8T71510002. 1.  Regarding the mounting of (1) Communication Interface Unit front panel and associated microphone:  What is the expectation for mounting this?  Will this unit simply set on the work surface or do you have something else in mind?  If so, we will require make/model & dimensions of this device. 	The referenced Communication Interface Unit (CIU) is a Motorola Centracom Gold Series Model # B1B22A unit with a detachable face panel. The main CIU enclosure measures 14 1/4 in W X 16 1/4 in D X 4 1/4 in H. The detachable face panel measures 14 1/4 in W X 3 5/8 in H X 1 in Deep. This detachable face panel is to be mounted in a freestanding enclosure that will sit on the work surface. 2.  Positioning of the number of 21 in monitors on some desks will be tight & may even overlap.  Has this been considered?  Would you consider a pole mount option (positioning one atop the other)? 	The size and positioning of the monitors has been considered. A pole mount or positioning monitors one atop the other is NOT an option as this would interfere with the viewing of the mission video and display screens located in the front of the mission ro oms.  3.  Room 48 specifies a console depth of 30 in.  Rooms 45 & 50 specify a 36 in depth.  Is this correct? 	The 30 in console depth for room 48 as well as the 36 in console depth for rooms 45 & 50 are correct. To keep cost down, we do our best to propose our standard product offerings.  Our product has an overall depth of 37 in (28 in is the depth of the work surface, 9 in is the rear framing).  Is our standard depth of 37 in acceptable for all rooms? It appears  there is sufficient space to accommodate our standard depth. 	Room 48 requires a 30 in console depth. Rooms 45 & 50 could use the 37 in console depth. 4.  In Room 48, shelving is mentioned, yet none of this is visible in the drawing.  We're assuming this is accessory shelving to attach to the slatwall.  Due to the size of the monitors, space will be limited for this type of accessory.  Accessories of thi s type are however available. Can you indicate where you want shelving to be located?  	The mentioned shelving is accessory shelving that would attach to the slatwall. This shelving should be able to be mounted on the slatwall at any position that would be required for the operator. 5.  Cabinets:  Our standard offering closest to the spec is 24w x 36d x 60h.  Acceptable?  	Not acceptable due to space limitations. 6.  Our standard printer stands are offered in the following sizes:  18 or 36 wide, 19 deep, 36 high.  Can these be used or adhere to spec?  	Due to space limitations, the specified size is required. 7.  Our front/rear steel panels are lift-off.  Do these need to be lockable for security purposes?  Any doors for CPU storage will have locks.  All panels as a standard do not.  Please advise. 	The front/rear panels do not require locks for security purposes.	 8.  Can you provide CPU make/model?.  We need to verify size.  	The CPU is a HP Model GF536UC#AVA desktop unit that measures 15 1/2 in W X 13 1/2 in D X 5 in H.	 9.  Notice that there are mobile file pedestals in the drawing. Not mentioned in the spec.  Requirement for these?  If so, how many & locations?  	These file pedestals were inadvertently left off of the specification requirements. These pedestals will need to be the same height as the console bases to allow mounting under the laminate top. Each pedestal should be approximately 15 in wide X 20 in dee p and contain three (3) drawers. The top and middle drawers should be approximately 5 ½ in tall and the bottom drawer should be approximately 11 ½ in tall. All drawers should include full extension ball-bearing slide s, full pull drawer fronts, and rubber bumpers for quiet drawer operation. These pedestals need to be the same finish as the console bases. We will require two (2) pedestals each for Room 45 and two (2) pedestals each for Room 50. 10.  Include task lighting (may be ok with overhead lighting), keyboards (may simply place on the work surface) ??       	Task lighting and keyboards are not required with this solicitation.  11.  Any other room environmentals/obstacles  that we need to know about for initial quote & drawing?  Otherwise we will use provided drawing  (for overall room dimensions) that have been supplied with this spec.  	No other room environmental issues/obstacles. 12.  Provide surge suppression protected outlet strips?  These are not specified would are typically required for most data centers we do. 	Surge suppression protected outlet strips are not required due to current filtered Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) power system.. 13.  Would an aluminum-extrusion-frame console system be acceptable, instead of the specified steel frame ?  We build a modular console system, based around a series of aluminum T-slot extrusions forming the core console frames.  This system is very strong , and provides great flexibility for any future modifications.   	An aluminum-extrusion-frame console system would be acceptable provided it is as strong and has the same longevity of the requested steel frame console. Along with the updates stated above, the date for the quotes to be submitted will be changed from Aug 9th at 8:00 AM MST to after the walk through.  The new due date for the proposals will be August 16th by 11:00 MST, no exceptions.  Please verify I have r eceived the proposal if I do not send a response automatically.  Will not be responsible for any quotes not received by the due date and time.  It is the best idea to put the proposal in an attachment and submit to my email address.
