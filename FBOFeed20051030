<DESC>The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18  24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each members fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, PPD testing for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the providers facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical providers facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Members health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males  it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

<SUBJECT>87 -- GEO Survey for Gode Eithiopia

<DESC>The below questions have been asked and answered as follows for Solicitation M67901-06-R-6001 - GEO Survey for Gode Ethiopia:

1. How big is the Gode study area (acres)? How much is its population?
 
Answer:  Contractors would not be evaluating the entire Gode area.  Rather, contractors would be validating specific sites pre-selected by Civil Affairs assets for desired impact on local population (i.e., would supply water to a nearby village); in order to determine if the site is suitable for drilling, etc.  For example, this validation could be done through the use of vertical electrical sounding (VES) methods using Schlumberger array, etc.      
 
2. Is there specific form for the cost component for this proposal? Is it lump sum proposal? Should it be broken down by logistics, geophysical survey, consultant hourly rate?  Should contractors provide separate cost for the feasibility study, preliminary design and final design? 
 
Answer:  What the government is looking for is the contractors recommended approach for validating these proposed sites -- both a technical approach and an associated cost structure.  How would the contractor validate a particular site for suitability?  What would it cost for one site?  What would it cost for five sites?  
 
3. The solicitation refers to the period of performance as November 10 to December 10, 2005. Is this for the feasibility study and preliminary design only? Does it include the detailed study?
 
Answer:  The Period of Performance (POP) includes delivery of the detailed study results.
