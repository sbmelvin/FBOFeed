<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is contemplating extending its contract with Florida International University (FIU), Contract No. 524-C-00-99-00011-00, under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. This contract was competed under full and open competition and its original purpose will remain unchanged. The modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly specialized technical assistance and training to key actors in the justice system in a crucial moment when a new judicial career law has just been passed and the contract for a new successor project is awarded. This modification will also extend the completion date of the contract by 6 months, from January 11, 2005 to July 10, 2005. The principal objective of this activity is to: 1) increase public awareness and NGO networking in promotion of access to justice; and 2) support the implementation of merit-based selection, promotion and sanction of judges. Florida International University is uniquely qualified to provide the assistance to be offered under the proposed extension, for the following reasons: 1) FlU is the only entity that has participated fully in the development of the key pieces of legislation included in the Nicaraguan justice  reform, thus it has a unique knowledge of and familiarity with this legislation; 2) FIU has unique experience in having accompanied the justice reform implementation process in Nicaragua thus far, including developing excellent working relationships with colleagues and counterparts in the judicial branch; and 3) extension of the contract with FlU will avoid incurring substantial additional costs and delays that could irreparably damage U.S. Government objectives in Nicaragua. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance  with Numbered Note 22. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD),  intends to enter into a sole source procurement with PyroGenesis Inc. (PGI) via the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC).  The Navy has been investigating plasma arc technology for the elimination of shipboard combustible solid waste for nearly a decade.  This effort has included work in a 6.2 Exploratory Development Program on plasma torch and waste interaction, development of several conceptual designs by leading companies in the plasma field, and a 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program that successfully constructed and tested a prototype system in full scale.  The developer of the ATD PAWDS, PyroGenesis Inc., has an exclusive licensing agreement with NSWCCD to market the PAWDS commercially.  The contractor has actively marketed the PAWDS and sold their first commercial system to a commercial company in 2003.  The commercial unit has performed effectively since its installation in October ! 2003, operating more than 1,500 hours and processing an estimated 700,000 pounds of solid waste.  The sale of additional units is pending the formal certification of the initial shipboard system.    Also in 2003, the Navy entered into a two-year contract with CCC/PGI to build and evaluate a commercial version of PAWDS in their Montreal facility to assess the system’s operability, reliability and maintainability.   Construction and delivery of the PAWDS Engineering Development Model (EDM) was completed in January 2004 and Navy testing is in progress.  Although testing will not be completed until December 2004, it appears that the PAWDS EDM will meet all CVN 21 requirements.  However, several potential upgrades have been identified for improving the performance of the control system and feed system reliability.   This follow-on contract is to fund CCC/PGI to provide engineering services, facilities, materials, manufacturing equipment and personnel needed to support the Navy’s continued refinement and reliability improvement of the PAWDS controls and feed system.  This effort will also make upgrades to the PAWDS electrical system and continue to support shipboard integration of PAWDS on CVN 21.  The results will be used to provide PMS 378, the program sponsor, with data and a validated design to support forward fit of the technology aboard CVN 21.   See Note 22.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes notification of  actions for both N61331-05-R-0010 and N61331-05-R-0011. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for the first lot of four (4) low rate initial production (LRIP) AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) (Solicitation No. N61331-05-R-0010). Additionally, after successful delivery of the first LRIP lot, the Government intends award a follow-on separate firm fixed price contract for the second LRIP lot of four (4) systems (Solicitation No. N61331-05-R-0011). The ALMDS is a LIDAR Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes floating and near-surface moored sea mines.  The system represents a capability that does not exist in the current Mine Countermeasures!  (MCM) inventory. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  (a) This acquisition implements the U.S. Navys acquisition strategy as documented in the Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) No. 0001-02-PMS 210, Revision 1 approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) on 09 June 2003. The SAMP states that LRIP quantities will be acquired sole source from the system developer. (b) Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the AN/AES-1 ALMDS system since the competitive award of the SD&D phase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems. (c) This is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired, is not expected to be recovered through competition. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  The systems will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Delivery will be sixteen (16) months after award of each contract.  The NACIS is 332999, Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 1287. Note 22 applies. Contract Specialist: Mary F. Hines, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, email – mary.f.hines@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710-Research and Development and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Only offers from small businesses in  accordance with this standard will be considered.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-05-00037, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal. (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-25.    A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation consisting of a twelve month base period. This procurement is for sentinel bird studies. Background.  A project funded by the Safe Buildings Program, under the National Center for Homeland Security of  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency seeks to determine whether the time-honored use of canaries as sentinels for exposure to airborne terrorist agents is scientifically defensible.   Canaries, pigeons and chickens continue to be used as sentinels (recent Gulf wars and 1995 Tokyo subway Sarin  release) because of their ability to give an easily readable and interpretable "response" to the user, and because they are not subject to non-toxic agents in the air, such as oil fumes.  They appear to have the advantage over purely chemical detectors in that they provide a rapid toxicological  assessment of air quality, not just foreign material in the air. Published research supporting the use of canaries in mines dates back to 1912 when the U.S. Bureau of Mines published a paper.  In this study, canaries and mice were exposed to carbon monoxide in a simple bell jar.  The study noted  that the canaries showed visible signs of distress (ruffling of feathers or jumping off perch) within minutes of the beginning of exposure.  The same concentration of carbon monoxide that caused this rapid response in a canary did not elicit a sensation in human subjects in mines until about 2  hours had passed, at which time the people became dizzy and disoriented.  Mice were also studied, with the conclusion that they did not show as visible a change as did canaries. The 1912 study of canaries and mice needs to be repeated and expanded to additional species and agents and results need  to be compared to data obtained using commercial chemical sensors.  We hope that the use of birds as sentinels can be eliminated or at least reduced, and that the limitations of using birds as sentinels can be revealed. However, before such conclusions can be reached, data need to be collected on  the time and concentration of response of several potential airborne toxicants in birds, and these data need to be compared to similar responses of other species (insects, etc.), and with humans and chemical monitors.  Each offeror must link to the web page listed below for a full copy of the  Statement of Work.Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria: The Government intends to award a single purchase order to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable proposal represents the 'best value' to the Government.   For this requirement best-value will be determined based on past  performance, technical capabilities, equipment and facilities and price.  Past performance, technical capabilities and equipment/facilities are of equal importance.  All factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  A. Past Performance-  Proposals shall be evaluated on  performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontracts/orders for research work on bird species similar to that described in the Statement of Work.  For each project/contract/order, offerors must include in their proposal:  (1) a list of contracts performed within the last three (3) years; and  (2) brief synopsis which includes the date the work was performed and the client for whom the work was performed (include client name and telephone number).   B. Technical Capabilities-Proposal must demonstrate the ability of the contractor to meet the requirements in the SOW.  This would include a  principal investigator for the study with at least 5 years of experience in the study of bird species, including exposure to toxicants, and technical staff experienced in care and handling of birds.  Resume/CVs must be included with the proposal for all key personnel.  Key Personnel are: 1) a  principal investigator, 2) a biological technician and 3) an animal care technician.  An individual may serve as more than one key personnel.  C.  Equipment and Facilities- Adequacy of equipment and facilities that meets the requirements in the Statement of Work.  These include sufficient  laboratory and office space, a certified chemical fume hood, bird housing space and bird cages and cage washing equipment. Due to the requirements of tissue collection, transport of fragile equipment, and training of contractor personnel by E.P.A. personnel located at Research Triangle Park, North  Carolina, it is preferred that the contractor facility be located within four (4) hours of the EPA RTP facility. D. Price- Pricing information must be submitted in the pricing tables provided for purposes of evaluation.  The total fixed price for the entire effort must be included in the initial  proposal.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source award from the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI). The purpose of this acquisition is to explore possible sources of vocational and occupational medical expertise, including specialists now employed in state disability determination service offices, or experts like those used by Administrative Law Judges who decide Social Security disability claims on appeal. NASI has previously conducted an in-depth study of SSA’s disability programs requested by the Committee on Ways and Means.  The purpose of this study is to enhance the expertise needed in disability decision making related to functional limitations of a claimant’s ability to perform jobs available in the national economy. NASI is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization devoted to research and education on social insurance programs.  NASI is uniquely qualified to perform this study because it includes in its membership many of the leading experts on Disability Income Policy.  SSA knows of no other organization that has the capability of providing the level of expertise of nationally recognized experts within allotted six months timeframe.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Interested parties may identify their interest by documenting their capability to fulfill the requirement.  The capability statement must be written and e-mailed to alice.roache@ssa.gov and received prior to November 18, 2004.  If no viable responses have been received, SSA shall proceed with negotiations with NASI. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This AMENDED Pre-Solicitation Notice is being posted to advise all prospective offerors that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) does NOT yet possess even a DRAFT version of the Clarus Concept of Operations and Use Case Diagrams----because NO draft is now in EXISTENCE.  The FHWA hopes to be able to post a PRELIMINARY draft version of those materials to http://www.clarusinitiative.org by November 23, 2004.   And the FHWA hopes to be able to post a REVISED draft version of those materials to that SAME Clarus web site as the revision becomes AVAILABLE in December of 2004.  Since all offerors will be able to access those reference materials when they are posted to that Clarus web site, the FHWA does NOT plan to ATTACH those reference materials to Solicitation No. DTFH61-05-R-00102.  Therefore, all prospective offerors are advised to closely and frequently MONITOR that Clarus web site, all the way up through the date on which proposals are DUE under Solicitation No. DTFH61-05-R-00102.

<DESC>UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>Amendment #3, issued 11/04/2004 The purpose of this Amendment is to respond to questions received and to extend the due date for information to 11/08/2004 in leiu of 11/05/2004. 1. Question: In the requested brief paper addressing the issue of small business set aside? Response: Yes 2. Question: Is issuing no other questions at this time to be answered at this time? Response: Yes, that is correct. 3. Question: Is the agency not requesting pricing information at this time? Response: Yes, that is correct. We are not requesting pricing information at this time. 4. Question: Would you please clarify the statement in the RFI that counseling services "in overseas location....be provided by US citizen". Does that mean that licnsed counselors who are fluent in English and who reside in foreign countries, but are not US citizens ma not provide face-to-face services? Response: All certified and qualified counselors must be a US citizen and must reside in the US. Expatriots living abroad are not acceptable. 5. Question: Is the desired intent to maximize access to information/resources via the internet, telephone and email, and to maintain a 6 session face-to-face EAP model for clinical services? Response: Yes, that is correct. 6. Question: The RFI identifies health and wellness, elder care, parenting and child-care.... and references something as Tri-Care. Can you clarify the terminology "Tri-Care" for me? Response: Tri-care is the medical for the military community. Our RFI is Amended to remove the need for the nurse line requirement. 7. Question: In approaching the development of an international network of providers, the six face-to-face session must stay within the 50% subcontracting limitation. Is that correct? Response: Yes, that is correct. The counselors who provide the six face-to-face sessions must have proper creditials and qualifications, and must be US citizens residing within the US. Our concept is to have one network that ensures that all providers are qualified and that the network is properly managed for quality. This RFI is to encourage industry to present alternative or innovative industry solutions. If splitting the work life center from the counseling is viable, please would like industry to provide an explaination as to how this could be approached. 8. Question: Is contractor required to give direct counseling to military community or will contractor refer military community to such assistance via internet, telephone and email? Confused due to given Class Code G - Social Services and NAICS 624190. Response: Response has been addressed above. If Class Code G and NAICS Code 624190 is confusing, can you explaination what Class Code and NAICS industry recommends for this type of service? In addition to the responses, we would like to clarify that the correct email address to be used is: FTS.R10Acquisition@gsa.gov That's FTS(period)R10Acquisition@gsa(period)gov

<DESC>This modification to the RFI is issued to respond to the following questions:

1.  Do we have to have an office in the Middle East or can our US-based office provide the necessary services with the required travel to the location.  

YES, THE CONTRACTOR MUST HAVE AN OFFICE IN THE MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE HE/SHE IS EXPECTED TO CONDUCT REGIONAL MEETINGS ON A MONTHLY BASIS AS WELL AS ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES.  IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR US TO FLY US-BASED STAFF OUT TO THE REGION.   

2.  As for submitting invoices within 10 business days, does that include the charges incurred by the hotels too ?  Or only the charges for the our personnel services ?

YES, ALL CHARGES NEED TO BE SUBMITTED WITHIN 10 BUSINESS DAYS.

3.  Is there any need for subject matter expertise or only logistics ?

YES, PLEASE SEE SECTION 11 OF THE SOW THAT WE SUBMITTED WHICH STATES THE FOLLOWING:

Factor A – Technical 

Offeror shall provide a technical proposal that describes their technical approach to the tasks described in this SOW. The technical proposal shall also relate the Contractor’s previous experience related to the following areas to his/her ability to perform the tasks describe in this Statement of Work:

a.	Experience providing government and private sector liaison services.
b.	Experience in event management (e.g., conferences, training workshops, study tours).
c.	Experience in travel management. 
d.	Fluent in Arabic.

4.  As for 3b, is cost-reimbursement only for the cost of the "conference" or does it also include cost for our staff's stay and time to provide the on-site logistics?

STAFF'S TIME IS INCLUDED IN THE MONTHLY MANAGEMENT FEE, BUT TRAVEL EXPENSES ARE REIMBURSED ON A COST BASIS.  THIS IS WHY WE PREFER TO HAVE A CONTRACTOR BASED IN THE REGION VS. THE US SO THAT THE COST OF TRAVEL IS MINIMIZED.  

STAFF TIME FOR LOGISTICAL HELP AT THE CONFERENCES WOULD BE NEGOTIATED ON A PER CASE BASIS.

<CONTACT>James Loeffler, Contract Specialist, Phone (321) 494-4220, Fax null, Email james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil - Donald Graham, Contracting Officer, Phone 321-494-6302, Fax 321-494-5403, Email don.graham@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources capable of performing research, development and program analysis support services for the Atmosphere & Space (A&S) Division (TTA) of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) in support of the United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System (USNDS) space and atmospheric mission.

BACKGROUND: AFTAC/TTA supports the overall AFTAC mission through the operation of the Nuclear Detonation(NUDET) Detection System (NDS) to detect, locate, identify, determine the yield of, and report in near-real-time all atmospheric and space NUDETs.  AFTAC/TTA also performs detailed analyses of data collected by these detection systems.

TTA is responsible for collecting and exploiting satellite-borne remote sensor data and providing national command authorities with nuclear weapon explosion data.  TTA is also AFTAC’s command-lead for consolidation of A&S operational requirements.  They develop and implement plans to meet operational requirements through the deployment of space-based sensors and associated ground processing equipment.  The space-based sensors used to collect data include Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) sensor suites hosted on Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and NDS sensor suites hosted on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, among others.  The ground data processing systems used include the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the AFTAC Low Intensity Signal Event (ALISE) processor, the NDS Analysis Package (NAP) ground segment, the Advanced RADEC Data Units (ARDUs), several classified systems, and the A&S Local Area Network (LAN). These satellite/sensor/ground data processing systems are collectively labeled the United States NUDET Detection System (USNDS).  This unique national asset provides the only US global detection capability for atmospheric and space NUDETs.

To perform its mission, TTA maintains a data processing and storage capability on a distributed client-server automated information system called the A&S LAN.  Additionally, they develop and maintain data analysis software to support A&S mission operations.  The use of contractor support provides a structured and documented approach for collecting valid user requirements, and the requirements identified by the users provide feedback for continued software process improvements.  A past consolidation of analysis techniques and algorithms has created seven functionally-unique software applications, each with a standardized Graphical User Interface (GUI).  This set of software applications represent the core of TTA’s analysis capabilities and are named QUERY, CAPTOOL, CAPFAST, DISPLAY, HEALTHTOOL, SIMTOOL, and TAOTOOL.  As algorithms, techniques, weapon and sensor designs, evasion scenarios, and data sources evolve or expand, TTA must remain the primary NUDET investigator for the USNDS.
	
CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and other services necessary to perform the work specified above.  The majority of the work will be performed at AFTAC/TTA, Patrick AFB, FL.  Specifically, the contractor shall perform the following activities: algorithm development; Research and Development (R&D); event characterization process improvement; continued A&S analysis program development and/or expansion; requirements capture; functional design of capabilities for analysis applications; “on-line” help documentation update and/or creation for application software; new data source incorporation into software and data processing baselines; software configuration and control, software validation and testing; technical evaluation of software and database test procedures; promote the transition of software and data; training of TTA personnel in the use of new or revised applications; user-training materials update; on-line TTA analysis tools upgrade and maintenance; technical meeting attendance/participation, and A&S LAN change documentation.

Additionally, the contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of requirements analysis and the ability to assess system and operational documentation to support TTA decision-making. The contractor shall define a structured and documented approach for collecting requirements identified by users to provide feedback for software process improvements. All TTA decision support functions other than those precluded from being contracted (policy-making and financial control) are within the scope of this effort. The TTA assessment process requires definition and/or clarification of space and ground data processing requirements, generation of cost/benefit trade studies to evaluate system alternatives to meet validated requirements, and conduct of operational assessments. The products from this support include capability analyses, feasibility studies, risk analyses, operational analyses, and new program initiatives.

Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of nuclear weapon phenomenology, extensive knowledge of satellite sensor operation and associated data processing, a working knowledge of both PC and UNIX operating systems, and an ability to program in C++ and other languages. Contractor personnel should also possess an ability to adapt to new sensor systems and ground processing systems while maintaining the TTA Legacy data. (Current TTA system has approximately 3 million lines of code hosted on an Oracle database that requires management and real-time updating.) It is imperative that no loss of analytical capability occurs between the current support effort and this proposed support effort.

Contractor’s experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted AFTAC A&S mission, therefore a history of relevant work is required.  Key contractor personnel should possess experience and have the ability to use the Atmospheric and Space analysis tools and applications discussed above.   Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in  performing software validation and testing in the AFTAC/TTA mission areas outlined above is required.

Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to TOP SECRET/SCI is required. Storage and Facility clearances of at least the TOP SECRET/SCI level are required.  

This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more that 20 pages and should address the following specific areas:

1.  The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract.
2.  The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit.
3.  Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above.
4..  Business size/status.


A cost plus fixed fee contract is contemplated with a 1 year base period and 4 one year options.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Responses may be mailed to 45CONS/LGCCB, Attn: James Loeffler, 1030 S. HWY A1A, Bldg 989, MS 1000, Patrick AFB, FL, 32925-3002.  Responses may also be e-mailed to james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil.  Questions may also be e-mailed to this address.  Responses are due no later than 12 March 2003.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has re-established its Cardiothoracic Surgery Branch (CTSB) as part of its Clinical Research Program in its Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  The Institute plans to create an academic research program in cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) that integrates basic research at the NIH and clinical investigation and acute patient care at a nearby hospital.  The CTSB, which operated from the 1950s through 1990, provided a world-class basic science and clinical investigation program that linked basic laboratory research and clinical investigation and served as a research and clinical training program for several generations of leading academic cardiothoracic surgeons.  For a variety of reasons, the cardiothoracic surgery capabilities within the NHLBI were phased out over 10 years ago.  However, changes in CTS in recent years require evaluation and further development of innovative surgical techniques.  Ongoing and frequent interaction between scientists, clinicians, and patients at the selected hospital and the NHLBI will bring the basic science changes in CTS into clinical practice more quickly through an integrated research approach.  The goals of the CTSB are to conduct innovative basic, translational, and clinical research that will advance the field of cardiovascular science and medicine and to train the next generations of academic cardiothoracic surgeons in leadership skills, research methodologies and techniques, and publication generation.  To accomplish these goals, the NHLBI plans to pursue mutually beneficial research collaborations with the selected hospital and other NIH Institutes and Centers.  In this pursuit, the NIH offers links between basic science and clinical investigations, swiftness in translating basic science to clinical usage, access to state-of-the-art animal facilities, presence of multidisciplinary research teams, capability to focus on selected science and health problems, support of a centralized coordinating facility, organization of a center of excellence in clinical research, and ability to provide timely integrated service delivery.  The NHLBI needs to partner with a hospital able to provide a leading academic cardiovascular surgeon who has experience in developing and leading a basic science and clinical research team, along with access to acute cardiovascular care.  The Chief Cardiothoracic Surgeon of the hospital will lead an integrated research program consisting of basic research and clinical investigation.  The NHLBI requires that the hospital provide an academic leader in cardiothoracic surgery who has: 1) a national and international reputation for outstanding basic and clinical research; 2) an established record of R01 funded research; 3) a history of leading basic and clinical research teams at an academic medical center; 4) an established record of teaching surgical fellows, residents, and medical students in the fundamentals of basic research, clinical research, and clinical medicine.  The Chief Cardiothoracic Surgeon will conduct basic research in the CTSB laboratory located in the NIH Clinical Research Center.  The surgeons in the CTSB will collaborate with basic investigators in the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  The products of this research will be translated into clinical investigations at the hospital in a “bench to bedside” approach.  An essential component of a successful, integrated research program is the proximity of the basic cardiothoracic research laboratory at the NHLBI to acute patient care, which is critical for academic surgeons and fellows to move quickly multiple times a day between the research laboratories at the NHLBI/NIH and the cardiothoracic surgical facility.  This will enable investigators to devote time to research activities and to respond to acute patient care in a timely manner from the NIH campus.  This is central to the success of the CTSB.  This fundamental principle of proximity is the basis for the configuration of the existing Clinical Research Center (CRC) at the NIH.   In the CRC basic scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and patients are co-located in the same building or in close proximity.  Meetings with investigators, collaborators, and staff occur several times daily and require surgeons to move back and forth from the clinical arena to the research facility in a timely fashion multiple times a day.  This fundamental principle is also the basis for the design of academic cardiothoracic research units where academic cardiothoracic surgeons conduct basic research in close proximity to the operating rooms, recovery rooms, and patient care units.  As examples, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Virginia, the University of Michigan, Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard University, Stanford University, and other outstanding cardiothoracic programs have the cardiothoracic basic research laboratory, the operating rooms, and patient care units within the same building, in adjacent buildings, or nearby on campus and in any event located no more that 10 minutes walking distance apart.  These models have been used to define the fundamental principle of close proximity of the CTSB basic research laboratory to the operating rooms and patient care units as 5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot.  A close coupling of an acute care hospital staffed by outstanding cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons with a history of supporting NIH research with a research infrastructure relevant to the NHLBI will make the CTSB a success.  Responses to this synopsis  will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria, which are presented in descending order of importance: 1) Evidence of ability to provide an academic cardiothoracic surgeon with prior leadership experience in basic science and clinical research. Evidence that this surgeon understands the academic model described above and how it will be implemented.  Evidence of the surgeon’s understanding of the research scope and objectives.  Evidence of ability to recruit, retain and train academic cardiac surgeons and soundness of plans to collaborate with researchers.  Experience of lead cardiothoracic surgeon in implementation of basic science and clinical research protocols, evidence of prior NIH R01 funding, and ability to conduct a program combining clinical excellence and mutually beneficial research collaborations;  2) Evidence of ability to meet the fundamental principle of close proximity; 3) Adequate availability, qualifications, experience, and demonstrated competence of cardiac surgeons, to include proposed affiliations and consultants, and overall understanding, willingness and ability to perform research protocols; 4)  Availability and skills of proposed staff, including project management, in providing the services, quality control, data collection, dissemination and training, and other collaborative activities necessary;  5) Evidence of feasibility to provide an adequate number of cardiac surgery patients to the cardiac surgery program, and evidence of ability to maintain community support for the research.  Ability to demonstrate that volume of cases will permit sufficient access to acute care patients so that clinical research, applied and basic research, and training and education components of the program can be successfully implemented.  The NHLBI intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Suburban Hospital for a five year contract program to provide the lead academic cardiothoracic surgeon skilled in basic science and clinical research as well as the acute care components of CTS,  if Suburban Hospital receives a Certificate of Need to perform cardiac surgery from the Maryland Health Care Commission.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Responses are due at the following address not later than December 20, 2004:  National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building Two, Room 6142, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, attention: Kathleen J.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-100-97-0034
<RESPDATE>122104

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center (PSC), SAS, Division of Acquisition Management intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to provide assistance to researchers who wish to use National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) data for secondary analysis.  RTI is conducting the NSCAW on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) under Contract Number 100-97-0034.  The PSC intends to modify this contract to add the additional services.  The statutory authority for conducting this requirement without full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   A major goal of NSCAW always has been to provide a resource to the child welfare research community by making the data sets available for analysis by researchers representing different disciplines and perspectives.  Although the original contract called for archiving data for use by the research community, the challenges that have been presented to end-users by the complexity of the data sets that ultimately were produced were unanticipated.  The structure of the data, as well as the advent of new analytic techniques, necessitates more user support than originally specified.  As users have begun to access the data, it has become evident that much more training and technical assistance to the users will be necessary to enable them to use the data appropriately.  ACF intends to extend the amount and type of technical assistance that can be provided to users.  The extended assistance will include two on-site workshops for in-depth training of new data users in the use and analyses of NSCAW data sets; development of multi-media users’ tools that would provide new and on-going users with independent, self-guided learning activities and assist with manipulating the NSCAW data sets; direct technical assistance to address user questions and to assist with data analysis; assistance to users in the merging of the NSCAW data with other data sets where restricted release guidelines prohibit the secondary user from performing these merges on their own;  assistance with costs associated with unannounced, on-site inspections to monitor data security procedures that are required of secondary users, and thereby reduce the cost of data licenses to those users.  Necessary skills and qualifications to provide the required services include in-depth knowledge of NSCAW data sets, including the structure of all interviews at all data collection points, the availability of each variable within each interview, the statistical properties of measures used, and the methodology and rationale for the creation of existing constructed variables.  RTI is uniquely qualified to accomplish this work, and the PSC does not believe that there are other potential organizations that possess the skills and resources to perform the tasks that are required for the following reasons: 1) Providing technical assistance and training on the use of NSCAW data sets requires extensive knowledge about the complex design decisions that affected the statistical weights that are needed for data analysis.  RTI developed the weighting procedures for the NSCAW and are experts on the use of these weights in data analysis. Due to the substantial weight variation associated with data, proper use of the weights is essential for valid statistical inferences.  In addition, when to use which weight and how to use them are areas that current NSCAW analysts find very challenging when working with these data, and knowledge of the statistical aspects of the survey and how the sample was designed and weights constructed is essential for knowing which weights to use for which analyses.  2) The length of time it would take for new statisticians to learn the details and implications of the weighting procedures would result in unacceptable delays in accomplishing the work.  The NSCAW data set consists of thousands of variables, which are embedded in four different interview/questionnaire sets that differ across four waves of data collection.  In addition, the data available for each interview/questionnaire set differs according to the age of the child, the setting in which the child lives, and the types of services that are provided to the child and family.   3) In-depth knowledge of the structure of the data sets, the rules that governed which items were administered for which subjects and at which time points, and the procedures that were used to construct the variables is necessary for providing training and technical assistance to others.  Since the data have not been available to entities other than RTI until recently, it is not possible for other organizations to have acquired the in-depth knowledge needed to provide training to others on an array of potential topics.  RTI staff has acquired this knowledge through a long-term process of actually developing the interviews and variables that now are available.  Although written documentation of these procedures has been provided as part of the current contract, our recent experience with hands-on training of data users convinces us that the acquisition of this knowledge by new data users is a time-consuming process, and it is unlikely that new entities could develop this knowledge in time to be of use to the field.  Again, unacceptable delays would result from having a new organization attempt to learn the amount of material that is necessary to accomplish the goals.  Since the NSCAW data sets represent a snapshot in time for children who are in a rapidly changing system, the data sets become increasingly less useful for informing policy and practice as time goes on.  4) Only RTI possesses all of the skills and abilities that would allow for timely implementation of the required tasks.    Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing their capability to satisfy the Government’s requirements within 45 days from the date of publication of this notice.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a modification of the existing contract with RTI.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available; therefore, requests for such a document will be considered inadequate responses.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the attention of Anthony Webb at the above address by mail or via E-mail at awebb@psc.gov.  See Numbered Note 22.

STATEMENT OF NEED


I.  BACKGROUND

The Western Federal Lands Highway Division (WFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is in the process of closing out Emergency Relief for Federally Owned (ERFO) disasters.  The FHWA is responsible for management oversight and accountability for the ERFO Program.  Disaster closeouts are required for repairs completed by the Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMA). 

Major tasks of the work include reviewing FLMA Closeout Reports, selecting projects to field review and projects to office review, setting up meetings, making travel arrangements to visit FLMAs, conducting closeout reviews, and preparing final closeout recommendations and correspondence.

In addition to closing out work completed by the FLMAs, the WFLHD must closeout work completed in-house. 

II.  WORK TASKS 

A.  Preliminary Review.  Review Closeout Reports prepared by the FLMAs. Under the direction of the ERFO Program Manager, make phone contact with the Agencies; resolve questions; and request additional information as needed to obtain the information requested from the Agency in the Closeout Letter sent by WFLHD. Verify that the closeout report agrees with WFLHD’s records.

1.  Are all the sites on the approved Program of Projects?

2.  Do the approved amounts agree with WFLHD records?

3.  Verify that the actual total expenditures by the FLMA sum correctly.

B.  Preliminary Review Submittal.  When the FLMA Closeout Report is complete and the disaster is ready for closeout, prepare closeout recommendations for approval by the ERFO Program Manager.  Recommend sites to review and a proposed itinerary and map.  Select projects that are grouped together to limit travel time.  Select a sampling of sites that meet the following criteria:

1.	Submitted project costs are much higher or much lower than the approved project cost, which may indicate a change in scope of project.

2.	Submitted costs are identical to approved costs, which may indicate costs are not actual costs

3.	High cost, technical projects 

4.	Force account projects

C.  Disaster Review Submittal.  Revise the Preliminary Review Submittal after review by the ERFO Program Manager, and prepare correspondence to establish a review with the FLMAs.

D.  Field Review.  Travel to the FLMA unit and review their documentation that supports their claimed actual expenses.  Travel to the field and review the selected projects.  Conduct a closeout meeting with the FLMA.  At the closeout meeting, review the results of the closeout field review and discuss their overall administration of the ERFO Program.

E.  FLMA Closeout Report.  Prepare ERFO Disaster Closeout Report as outlined in the ERFO Manual.  Provide a summary report of the field review, specifically addressing each project reviewed, and make closeout recommendations to the ERFO Program Manager, based on the eligibility criteria in the ERFO Manual and the actual cost data provided by the FLMA.  Include digital photos of the field-reviewed sites in the Closeout Report.  Discuss the report with the WFLHD ERFO Program Manager.  Provide an electronic and paper copy of the closeout report.

F.	WFLHD Closeout Report.  Prepare a Closeout Report, for approval of the ERFO Program Manager, for each disaster that accounts for all costs expended by WFLHD for the disaster. 
	
	1. Identify all projects for which WFLHD expended funds.

2. For each project, list the Damage Site Reports (DSR), and their approved estimated cost.  Provide a copy of the DSR with the completed report.

3.	Compile the actual costs expended for each project from financial reports and provide a copy of the financial reports supporting the total amount

4.	If available, include a copy of the cover sheet for the construction contract.

5.	Provide a summary spreadsheet of the estimated total costs and final actual costs.

G.	Prepare Closeout Letter.  Prepare a draft letter to the FLMA for signature of the ERFO Program Manager, that closes out the disaster and revises the Program of Projects (POP) to the final actual cost to repair eligible damaged caused by the disaster.

H.	Progress Meetings/Reports.  

1.	Weekly/Monthly/Bi-Monthly meetings/teleconferences will be scheduled with the WFLHD ERFO Manager to discuss progress on assigned projects.  

2.	Progress reports will be submitted monthly with invoices for the WFLHD ERFO coordinator to review.  Reports shall indicate current progress on assigned projects, anticipated work, and any foreseen or current barriers effecting progress.  

I.	Deliverables.

1.	Digital Images:  Images will be saved as JPEG/GIF/TIFF and be incorporated/referenced in the reports as “Figures”.

2.	Documents will be submitted both electronically and in print.  Electronic files will be formatted for Microsoft Office compatibility.  

IV.  QUALIFICATIONS

Persons performing work must have knowledge of the Federal Highway Emergency Relief (ER or ERFO) Program, including knowledge of the current ERFO Manual. This knowledge may be obtained through experience with the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Land Management Agencies, State Departments of Transportation, Homeland Security, or counties.  Past work experience must include at least one of the following:

A.  Completing DSR fieldwork

B.  Making ER or ERFO eligibility determinations

AIR UNIVERSITY’S SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES
STATEMENT OF NEED


I.  OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this Statement of Need (SON) is to describe, for preliminary planning purposes only, the requirements of Air University (AU) that have been ear-marked for a Commercial Activity (OMB A-76 Study).  This SON captures in general terms the software development support activities for all existing, planned, and future AU enterprise-level automated information systems (AIS).  Typical software technical services and engineering support include capturing user and stakeholder requirements; coordinating with the appropriate AU agency personnel and performing tasks associated with enterprise architecture; capital investment planning; program/project management, identifying functional security, performance requirements, developing logical and physical database models; performing coding, testing, quality assurance, backup/recovery, design, program and system documentation, software maintenance, implementation; and maintaining interoperability between existing and future hardware and software applications.  Software applications include, but are not limited to client-server applications, web applications, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integration, Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) integration, and custom applications development.  
     Software services not only support the Headquarters AU Directorates, but support is also provided to several AIS in the various AU colleges/schools.  These include, but are not limited to the following.  Air War College educates senior level officers (256 in-resident and 3,500 distant learners) to lead at the strategic level in the development and employment of air and space forces in support of National Security.  Air Command and Staff College is the Air Force’s intermediate professional military education school that prepares field grade officers (over 600 resident and 9,000 distance learners and seminar students) of all services, international officers, and U.S. civilians to assume positions of higher responsibility within the military and other government agencies.  The Squadron Officer College consists of the Air and Space Basic Course for 2nd Lieutenants and Squadron Officers School for Captains combined under one college.  Together these two schools prepare young officers for challenges of the future and develop leaders of tomorrow who will support the expeditionary culture.  The Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Development (CPD) provides professional continuing education and technical training to Air Force, International, and other DoD personnel.  CPD has eight component schools that offer 83 resident and distance learning courses to over 9,000 students annually.  The Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS) provide leadership and policy direction for the Air Force’s officer recruiting, training and commissioning programs at Officer Training School and at Air Force ROTC detachments at 144 universities.  About 80 percent of the new officers who enter the Air Force each year come through one of these programs.  AFOATS also directs the Air Force’s high school citizenship training program – Air Force Junior ROTC at more than 744 Air Force ROTC units on high school campuses around the world.  The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) offers and awards job-related associate in applied science degrees that support the career transition of Air Force enlisted members.  Over 161,000 students completed about 1.7 million semester hours of course credit through CCAF affiliated schools in 2001-2002.  In the October 2004 graduating class, over 7,000 associate in applied science degrees were awarded.  Since its inception in 1993, the College for Enlisted Professional Military Education (CEPME) has refining, adapting, and deploying PME curriculum for enlisted education in the Air Force.  The Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning provides distance learning methodologies and technologies to support instructionally sound learning throughout the service.  This is accomplished through the Extension Course Program, the Air Technology
Network and ADL consulting services

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser NSN 1370-01-158-5322. The SUU-25 F/A is used by the Air force on the A-10 aircraft to store and dispense LUU-1, LUU-2, LUU -4, LUU-5 and LUU-19 (target markers and illumination) flares in flight.   Function/Description: The SUU-25 F/A dispenser is approximately 14 in diameter by 92 long and holds 8 flares.  It is affixed to the aircraft by means of two suspension lugs and has two electrical receptacles.  Eight flares are loaded in the dispenser, tw o per launch tube, (one behind another), and eight ARD-863impulse cartridges are loaded in the breech assembly prior to being installed onto the aircraft.  During flight, launch signals are initiated from the pilot and sent to the intervalometer (stepper s witch), which in turn, sequentially directs the firing pulse to each impulse cartridge in order #1 through #8. The impulse cartridge pressure is directed through a manifold to eject the flare from the aft position. As the flare leaves the launch tube, armi ng hooks in the dispenser pull the arming cap off of each flare to start the flare actuation timer.  The intervalometer sequences to the second position for the fire pulse to initiate the impulse cartridge behind the flare in the fore position. This is rep eated in each subsequent tube until all of the flares have been dispensed.   Performance:  The SUU-25 F/A dispenser is a mission critical item and must perform in a wide variety of extreme environmental and loading conditions.  The dispenser must be tested per Specification #SP8020305, Fabrication Specification Dispenser, Flare SU U-25F/A prior to acceptance. Potential Manufacturer:  The SUU-25F/A consists of a wide variety of parts ranging from structural, to mechanical and electrical components.  Many different materials and processes are required to manufacture the dispenser.  Some of these are listed below: Tooling & machining operations  Forming, shearing, and shaping of sheet metal Welding/Mechanical Fastening Electromechanical components, wiring & soldering Metal casting Plating/Painting for corrosion protection Materials include: Various metal alloys, polymers, and composites. A potential manufacturer should provide a brief summary of their manufacturing process/capability, equipment, critical skills, quality control system, and evidence of items that have been manufactured with similar complexity to the SUU-25 F/A dispenser.   In addition, it is requested that the potential manufacture provide the following information: 1.	What is an economical quantity for this item? 2.	What is a reasonable schedule for delivery that includes First Article Testing? The technical data package (TDP) is classified per Distribution Statement D-limited distribution. Distribution Statement D means that the TDP cannot be routed via the internet.  Interested parties must be registered with the U.S./CANADA Joint Certification  Office to obtain a copy of the Technical Data Package  (see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  The request must include: cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address and point of contact.  Please request a copy of t he TDP via email from joseph.marina@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>70 -- SUDAAN Software
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source  purchase order to the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) for the renewal of the SUDAAN software release 9.0 for PC LAN SAS.   

It is CDC’s information that SUDAAN is the only software package available that is designed to analyze survey and other cluster-correlated data, offering nine statistical procedures and allowing the user to estimate variances using three methods:  Taylor series linearization, Jackknife or Balance repeated replication.  The nine statistical procedures include three that are designed to provide descriptive statistics (e.g. percents, means, percentiles, ratio estimates); four regression procedures (linear, logistic, multinomial logistic and log-linear models) and two survival procedures (including proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier model estimation).  All procedures will properly account for complex design features inherent in most studies including clustering, stratification and unequal weighting. SUDAAN offers design-corrected analysis of correlated data encountered in numerous applications, including sample surveys, epidemiological study data, clinical trial data, experimental studies, longitudinal data and repeated measure studies. 
SUDAAN is a very specialized one-of-a-kind software product designed and developed by RTI for analyzing clustered data arising in many applications, including complex sample surveys, randomized experiments, and epidemiological studies. SUDAAN offers procedures for descriptive statistics and for statistical modeling. The modeling procedures include both linear and multinomial-logistic models and a procedure for fitting proportional hazards (Cox) regression models for time-to-event data. SUDAAN is a single program comprising a family of nine analytic procedures designed to analyze complex data sets. 
Together, the procedures and techniques available with SUDAAN provide CDC with a variety of analytic tools not available in other software packages.  CDC users have received in-depth training on this product, and the researchers have been using it for several years.  Given its unique characteristics and capabilities, it is not believed that the required ongoing research can realistically be accomplished and mission critical work cannot be accomplished by CDC scientists using other products.

The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR part 6.302-1, in that RTI is the only known source for this requirement.   This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they offer a package similar to the SUDAAN product under the proposed procurement are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be sent to William Bancroft by fax at 770-488-2847 or by email to WBancroft@CDC.GOV.

<SUBJECT>A -- AFRL Det 8/PK Web Site
<DESC>The Phillips Research Site Directorate of Contracting is announcing procedures aimed at decreasing  lead-time for Broad Agency Announcement contract-awards to industry.
 
While most procedural changes are internal to the Contracting Directorate itself, the process is founded in a strategy of gathering all  information necessary for award at the onset of the acquisition, and eliminating iterative Government requests for updated, or more complete, information from the offeror.
 
The Directorate recognizes the burden levied upon industry by repeated requests for information, it is costly and time-consuming .
 
Likewise, the Directorate realizes it is incumbent on the Government to sufficiently describe the nature and detail of information required in order to make award.
   
As such, the Directorate has dedicated itself to communicating its requirements for such information to industry, and  has established the Det 8 AFRL/PK web site to facilitate this communication  (http://www.de.afrl.af.mil/PK/ , available on or about 10 Nov 2004).  There,  the offeror will find a number of documents  to assist in developing complete and responsive offers to Phillips Research Site contracting opportunities.  
 
With respect to these items, interested offerors are specifically reminded:  1) To adhere to each acquisition's cost-proposal instructions; 2) To submit required subcontracting plans at the time of technical/cost-proposal submission; and 3)  That failure to provide a complete proposal may result in a determination that the proposal is non-responsive, and its elimination from consideration for award by the Government.  
 
It is the Directorate's desire to make this process as  efficient as possible for all parties, and your experiences and opinions are important to the process. We earnestly solicit your support for this initiative in the spirit of acquisition partnership and streamlining.    Please direct your feedback on this initiative to John Webb, 505-846-4457; John.Webb@Kirtland.AF.MIL; 2251 Maxell Avenue, Kirtland AFB, NM 87177.

Maintenance support provides the required software fixes, corrections and revisions necessary to ensure a stable processing environment.

This software is a test and development support tool, used in the construction and maintenance of an application test environment.  SSA uses this software for the creation of realistic and representative test data essential to the integrity of SSA’s programs.  The software helps to streamline and simplify SSA’s application development environment, while satisfying applicable security and privacy requirements.  SOFTBASE has no authorized resellers of this maintenance.  The anticipated Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) description, and quantity are as follows: CLIN 0001: Maintenance for TESTBASE (formerly DGF-Data Generation Facility) based on 800 MIPS.  QTY: 1 (one) year.  SOFTBASE is the only authorized dealer of this maintenance known to the Government. The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The solution must include a central repository to store application release and disaster recovery information.  The system solution must support all DISA CS Windows, UNIX 32 and 64 bit versions (Solaris, HP-UX and AIX), and Linux platforms located at the System Management Centers (SMCs), Processing Elements (PEs), other Department of Defense (DoD) customer locations, and outside agencies. The scope of the implementation will initially support approximately 2,000 servers.  A phased implementation approach at each location will be used in order to best match expenditures with cost recovery/avoidance concerns. The resultant contract is anticipated to be a firm fixed price contract with a potential start date of 2005, with four (4) one (1) year option periods.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519.  The solicitation may be downloaded from the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOPPS) website at http://www.eps.gov.  or DITCO’s Contrating Opportunities website at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
		Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
		2100 Second Street, SW
		Washington, D.C. 20593
		Telephone (202)267-2285
		FAX:  (202)267-4011

SERVICES AND PRICES: Line Item 1 The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has a need for contractor support in its Evaluations Office to assist in collecting and analyzing project information for a number of USTDA evaluation activities.  This work project is designed to comprehensively acquire necessary information on recently completed USTDA projects; to make that information available to staff and to the general public in a useful manner; and to utilize some of the information to complete certain specific evaluations projects.  The crucial aspects of the work are:  (1) the Evaluations Consultant will obtain information from USTDA files, (supplemented as necessary by discussion with the regional teams and by calls to private companies) on all new USTDA obligations.  This information will be placed in the appropriate place in the evaluations data file in the electronic database; new records will be created for brand new projects; old records will be revised when there has been a new obligation on an old project.

3.7.3  Safety precautions.  Observe the following safety precautions, during test performance:
·	Keep personnel out of boat during test.
·	Keep boat low, to reduce damage, if boat drops.
·	Do not exceed specified test weights.
·	Avoid dynamic loading during test.
3.7.4  Test procedures.
3.7.4.1  Measure and record the weight of the MSB.
3.7.4.2  Add weight to the boat to achieve a maximum test load of 10,500 pounds, including the weight of the boat; ensure that the load is distributed with one half forward, and the other half aft, as near to the hoisting fittings as possible, in order to minimize strain on the boat.
NOTICE!
Weight to be added to the boat is equal to 10,500 pounds (or 150 percent of the davit’s normal hoisting load, which is 7,000 pounds) minus the measured weight of the boat.  Added weight may consist of sandbags or concrete sinkers placed upon a minimum of 3/8" plywood in order to protect the boat from damage.
3.7.4.3  Lift the loaded boat by its normal hoisting equipment, and suspend for at least 10 minutes, just clear of the water, to minimize damage in case of failure of any component.
3.7.5  Post-test inspection.  Upon completion of test, unload the MSB, and inspect the hoisting equipment, including the base and fasteners for Rottmer Release Gear in the boat; ensure that no parts have been unduly strained, and no welds between the deck and hoister show cracks or deformation.
3.7.6  Documentation of test results.  Furnish a written report to the Coast Guard inspector within 24 hours after completion of load test.  Include in the report an evaluation of all conditions found and recommendations for any repairs required.
3.7.7  Label plate.
3.7.7.1  Upon successful completion of load testing, the Contractor shall provide and imprint an anodized-hydrated aluminum label plate with 1/4" letters for each tested boat handling equipment; ensure that each plate states the following:
·	Date of weight test.
·	Test facility.
·	Test load.
3.7.7.2  Permanently affix the above label plates in the vicinity of the boat davit assemblies as directed by the Coast Guard Inspector.
4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE
4.1  Wire rope certification.  The Contractor shall provide the COR written documentation certifying that all new wire rope assemblies have been pull tested and lubricated prior to installation.
