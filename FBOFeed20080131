<DESC>100% 8(a) Alaska Native Corporation Set-Aside FAA has a requirement for a Community Benefits Study as part of the Alaska Flight Services Modernization Program. This is a public announcement.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).   Background A community benefits study is required by the Alaska Flight Service Modernization (AFSM) program.  The AFSM program is currently conducting a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in accordance with the milestones required by the FAA Acquisition Management System for a successful Final Investment Decision.  The CBA will show the costs and benefits to the FAA and users of the FAA system of improving aviation services in Alaska through the AFSM program.  The AFSM Program Office needs to determine the value of improved aviation services to Alaskan communities in terms of community benefits. With increased aviation services, these remote areas will have greater access to transportation for medical appointments, grocery delivery, education and other services that are provided more routinely in the lower 48 states.  The additional health, financial, educational, social and economic benefits that Alaskan citizens may obtain through the AFSM program are the community benefits that need to be determined.  Findings from the AFSM community benefits study will be incorporated into the AFSM CBA for the Final Investment Decision.  The purpose of this community benefit study is not to determine improvements of safety (fatality, injury and damage reductions) or efficiency (delay and cancellation reduction) benefits.  This study is to address community impact. In accordance with FAA AMS Paragraph 3.2.2.4, FAA has determined it to be in its best interest to award a single source contract to Doyon Emerald, Anchorage, AK.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Vickie Gordon, Contracting Officer by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, February 15, 2008.  E-mail responses are preferred. Please forward responses to Vickie.Gordon@faa.gov.

<DESC>Introduction:

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement for advancing the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations. 

The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to facilitate the research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents and emerging infectious disease, including pandemic influenza, that threaten the U.S. civilian population. One of the central responsibilities of BARDA is to lead the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE), which provides an integrated approach to the development, purchase and utilization of medical countermeasures for public health medical emergencies. The HHS PHEMCE consists of NIH, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness Response (ASPR), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Centers for Disease Control and Proevention (CDC), along with ex officio participation from other federal agencies. To guide progress toward the goal of public health preparedness, the HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats (http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/barda/phemce/enterprise/strategy/index.html) provides insight into the current priorities for medical countermeasure development against advanced, enhanced, and emerging threats.


Description:

Through this solicitation NIAID and BARDA are partnering to support the development and evaluation of innovative technologies and platforms for the development of therapeutics with either single-pathogen or broad spectrum activity against select NIAID Category A, B and C (http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) biothreat pathogens and toxins. 

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-18 (www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/print/20070207-2.html) expands on the traditional classification of Category A, B, and C biological threats to include:
    * Enhanced agents - traditional agents that have been modified or selected to enhance their ability to harm human populations or circumvent available countermeasures. (e.g. extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
    * Emerging agents - previously unrecognized pathogens that might be naturally occurring and represent a serious risk to human populations (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus).
    * Advanced agents - novel pathogens or other biological materials that have been artificially engineered in the laboratory to bypass traditional countermeasures or produce a more severe or otherwise enhanced spectrum of disease (e.g. multi-drug resistant Bacillus anthracis).

These designations highlight the fact that advanced, enhanced, and emerging threats are likely to be unanticipated and ill-defined in comparison to traditional threat agents. To more effectively address these lesser known and ill-defined threat agents and to encourage overall innovation in the product development process, NIAID and BARDA are supporting product development strategies that include:
    * Development and Evaluation of treatments with broad spectrum activity. 
    * Development and evaluation of broad spectrum technologies. 
    * Development and evaluation of broad spectrum platforms. 

Through this solicitation, NIAID and BARDA seek to support development of specific products in which one or more innovative broad spectrum technologies and/or platforms are proposed to be used and evaluated in the development of one of the following broad spectrum (e.g. inhibiting conserved, universal bacterial and/or viral targets) or narrow spectrum (single-agent) biodefense countermeasures:

Broad spectrum therapeutic:
    * Broad spectrum anti-bacterial - therapeutic with activity against more than one genera of bacterial pathogen, including at least one of the following: Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, and Rickettsia prowazeki. Broad spectrum anti-bacterials that target other Category A, B and C bacterial threat agents will be considered on the basis of the overall innovation of the strategies proposed for their development.  
    * Broad spectrum anti-viral - therapeutic with activity against more than one genera of viral pathogen, including at least one of the following: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Junin virus, Varioloa major, and influenza. Proposals for broad spectrum anti-virals that target other Category A, B and C viral threat agents will be considered on the basis of the overall innovation of the strategies proposed for their development.
    * Broad spectrum anti-toxins - NIAID and BARDA are particularly interested in therapeutics with activity against multiple serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin. Proposals for broad spectrum anti-toxins that target other Category A, B and C toxins will be considered on the basis of the overall innovation of the strategies proposed for their development. 
    * Broad spectrum anti-disease - therapeutic directed at a host response that reduces morbidity and mortality from exposure/infection and is effective against more than one Category A, B or C priority threat agent. 

Narrow spectrum or single-pathogen therapeutic:
    * Treatment for Bacillus anthracis and multi-drug resistant Bacillus anthracis
    * Post-exposure prophylactic for multi-drug resistant Bacillus anthracis
    * Treatment and post-exposure prophylactic for Variola major 
    * Treatment and post-exposure prophylactic for Marburg virus
    * Treatment and post-exposure prophylactic for Ebola virus
    * Treatment and post-exposure prophylactic for Influenza
    * Treatment for dengue virus

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria:
    * The potential of the proposed broad spectrum technology or platform to advance the product development process for the proposed therapeutic candidate/product or lead series, and contribute overall to ''state-of-the-art'' drug development technologies.
    * The suitability of the proposed therapeutic candidate/product or lead series for further development.	
    * The soundness and feasibility of the Strategic Staged Product Development Plan for advancing the therapeutic candidate/product toward a licensed product for the proposed indication within the requested period of funding.
    * The adequacy of the Statement of Work to describe the necessary activities, services, personnel, materials, equipment and facilities to be provided by the Offeror and any proposed subcontractors to perform the proposed Work Plan.
    * Qualifications and availability of proposed personnel.
    * Availability and adequacy/suitability of facilities, equipment, and other resources to effectively and safely perform all phases of the proposed project.
    * Adequacy of the Project Management Plan in terms of staffing, organization, responsibilities, leadership and lines of authority.
		
It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about May 15, 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 5-8 FTEs. 

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about February 15, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR), Charleston, South Carolina, is issuing a notice of  intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with BMG LabTech, in support of the existing NOVOstar and FLUOstar scientific instruments (hereafter called instruments) for preventative maintenance, software, and technical support.  The NOVOstar instrument is used for cell-based kinetic assays in research and development, and are used to screen large numbers of compounds in kinetic cell-based assays or to create a dose response curve by measuring a wide range of analyte concentrations and target various types of applications such as  Ca2+ uptake,  membrane potential studies, intracellular pH, measurement of intracellular ionic changes, fluorescent reporter gene assays, and traditional fluorescence assays involving up to eight excitation and emission pairs. The FLUOstar microplate reader instrument is used for capturing the full absorbance spectrum (220 to 850 nm) at a resolution of 1 nm which targets the following applications: Ca2+ measurements (e.g. Ca2+ flux with Fura-2, Indo-1, FLUO-3/4), enzyme activity, FRET/BRET assays, cell toxicity, proliferation and viability, protein and nucleic acid quantitation (e.g. Bradford, Lowry, DNA, 260/280 nm), ATP quantification, immunoassays, ELISA, luciferase, dual luciferase, BRET with sequential dual emission detection, ORAC and ABEL antioxidant assays, and fluorescent proteins, including FRETs (e.g. CFP/YFP).  The requirement for continued preventative maintenance of instrument, technical and software updates support services, is necessary for daily analyses of marine toxin detection in support of the Center?s environmental research program. This requirement is expected to provide for one twelve-month base period, and four twelve-month option periods.  The continuity of the software updates, technical and instrument maintenance support is imperative to CCEHBR?s essential research and development. The Center?s focus is the research and development of diagnostic tools to measure coastal ecosystem health, and the chemical, biomolecular, microbiological, ecological, toxicological and histological methods that are used in both laboratory and field studies to describe, evaluate, and predict the controlling factors and outcomes of natural and anthropogenic influences in marine and estuarine habitats. BMG LabTech is the only know source capable of providing the required services.  The BMG LabTech?s software and instruments are 100% compatible and will work with the existing system. The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The applicable NAICS code is 334516. The size standard is not to exceed 500 employees. All applicable awards shall be in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12). CAR clauses 1352.239-73 Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources (Dec 2006) will apply. Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by January 31, 2008. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to repair the pier jetty, pipeline supports, and road surface at the DeLong Pier.  The work includes, but is not limited to:  Repair and bracing of approximately 600 meters of the 10? pier offloading pipeline, which extends into North Star Bay.  Work items include reconstructing expansion loop on pipelines, replacement of inadequate pipe supports, realignment of pipelines, and repair and maintenance of the pipeline access road.  In addition, work includes installation of protective guard rails to prevent piping system from vehicle impact at the marine pier area.  Ensure supports are installed deep enough to prevent movement from frost heave. Piping system requiring guard rails is estimated to be 600 linear feet.  Regulatory requirement is to provide traffic bollards/guard rails to protect fueling piping and equipment on piers, wharves, and roadways (UFC 3-460-01). Piping systems shall be supported and protected against physical damage and stresses arising from impact, settlement, vibration, expansion, and contraction.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The performance period for this phase is 365 days.  There is a 245 calendar day winter exclusionary period from 15 September to 15 May wherein no work will be permitted.  This period is included in the total performance period.  FUNDS ARE PRESENTLY NOT AVAILABLE, BUT ARE  EXPECTED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF FEBRUARY 2008. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE SOLICITATION, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE PROPOSAL CLOSING DATE. Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation. It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 29 February 2008 with offers due 30 days thereafter. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) International Agreement, to US, Danish and Greenlandic firms. No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed. Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>Individual Assistance-Technical
Assistance Contracts III Re-compete (IA-TAC)

This Request for Information/Draft PWS is to solicit industry input to achieve FEMA?s Mission in accordance with Stafford Act to assist individuals and families that have been affected by disasters (natural or man-made) to have access to the full range of FEMA programs in a timely and efficient  manner.  The programs require contractor/contractor team capable of delivering a comprehensive set of construction, architectural, engineering, project management and program management services in support of multiple disaster missions of any size anywhere in the United States and its territories.  

The following are questions/concerns needing industry?s input and feedback to assist FEMA to refine the performance work statement for IA-TAC III Contract(s):

The task orders issued under this contract would require performance to take place anywhere in the country and its territories and begin within hours or a few days.  The volume of work and the value of each task are unpredictable.  We anticipate that the resultant contract will be awarded to multiple firms, each given a fair opportunity to compete for individual task orders.  Considering the potential demand on any firm?s resources, FEMA encourages you to offer suggestions on how best to meet our goals of:

Increasing small business participation as prime contractors;
Awarding tasks to firms residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by a major disaster or emergency (refer to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5121 (The Stafford Act)).

1.	In responding to the above, please address these questions:
2.	Would it be effective to award contracts geographically, by state or by regions?
3.	Would it be effective to award contracts to firms who are experienced by types of disasters (i.e. earthquakes, versus hurricane versus wild fires versus ice storms)?
4.	Would it be effective to set-aside one award to a small business in each state or region and if so, should a monetary limit on the task order be set before fair opportunity is given to the large contractors in that state or region?
5.	Would it be effective to carve out a portion of the work effort described for a single award to a small business on a national or regional basis?
6.	Is it more practical and beneficial to award as Architect and Engineering (A&E), Construction or service?
7.	Suggestion on the most relevant NAICS Code(s)?
8.	Suggestion on the most relevant Classification Codes(s)?
9.	Any better way to approach to fulfill IA-TAC III requirement?

In accordance with FAR 15.201, FEMA is implementing early exchanges of information with the industry in order to receive suggestions which will assist to improve the understanding of Government requirements, resolve concerns regarding the complete issues of the contracting of the requirement to best serve FEMA?s mission.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e) responses to this notice are not offers and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  POINT OF CONTACT:  Should you have any questions regarding the RFI, please forward to the address indicated below or call (202) 646-7072.

Please send all your suggestions, information and documentation electronically to Zahra Hashmi at zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov, george.w.herndonIII@dhs.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Navy - Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA)
<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060
<RESPDATE>063007
<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

The anticipated release date of the RFP is the week of 30 June 2007. Upon formal release of the RFP, interested parties will be able to view/download the RFP (N00019-07-R-0060) which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.     

In addition to making the solicitation available for downloading via the Internet site, this office will also attempt to E-mail a notification of release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to all prospective offerors that submit a request to register for this information via E-mail. E-mail requests should be sent to the following address: Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil and should include the following information for the purpose of compiling a Bidders Mailing List: 1. Company Name 2. Company Address 3. Point-of-contact, telephone number, fax number and E-mail address. In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to use the Internet for the purpose of submitting requests relative to this solicitation. Telephone requests for the solicitation will neither be accepted nor returned. A paper copy of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available or issued. 

NOTE:     Contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.   

All Discussions, Comments, Or Questions relative to the the MFOQA Solicitation must be addressed directly to the Contracts office.

<DESC>U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) intends to obtain Microsoft Technology Strategy Services (MTSS), Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) and Microsoft Premier Support Services (MPSS) from Microsoft Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and all of its components, for a DHS-wide Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The contract will have a base period of three months and 3 three-month option periods with task orders issued against the contract. This contract supports the DHS mission, is in compliance with and under the direction of DHS, federal and executive mandates, national security, as well as emergency response.  

CBP's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) is responsible for the implementation and support of information technology (IT), research and development functions, and automation and technological strategies for meeting mission related needs. Specifically, OIT is responsible for automated information systems, management of the research and development functions and all forensic and laboratory support of the agency. OIT manage all computer and related resources including all operational aspects of the Computer Security Program; establish requirements for computer interfaces between CBP and various trade groups and Government agencies; and manage matters related to automated import processing and systems development. OIT focuses on integrating business and technical solutions across the OIT enterprise with an emphasis on a collaborative approach.

The objective is to provide access to Microsoft Services in support of DHS' effort in planning, implementing, deploying, using, and maintaining its Microsoft software, solutions and technologies. Access includes DHS' ability to establish unique and singularly distinct access to Microsoft's product divisions that is necessary to support and maintain CBP's far-reaching mission. Microsoft Services' infrastructure and developer expertise will be engaged to implement solutions and provide knowledge transfer to the Government and support the Government in the validation and measurement of its system integrators' involvement of Microsoft technologies in the areas of collaboration, security, connected systems, operational efficiency and deployments.

Microsoft personnel have access to proprietary information exclusively available within Microsoft such as internal product support knowledge bases and proprietary architectural and technical information not available to the public or third party (Microsoft Certified Software Engineers- MCSEs). Additionally, Microsoft personnel have access to internal development teams within Microsoft who wrote the code behind Microsoft's application. This is not only essential, but the only way to resolve complex programming and support issues efficiently. Given the state of the art technology and ability to obtain high level information available to solely Microsoft employees, Microsoft is determined to be essential to DHS' ability to quickly develop and deploy applications that have a high degree of reliability.

Microsoft is the only company that could provide an advanced escalation service that would support changes to the code-base within Microsoft's proprietary product offerings in order to respond to a Critical IT event, emergency, or for national security, within a 36 to 72 hour timeframe and resolve Critical IT Events within DHS' major IT investments in order to achieve our objectives and overall success.

<DESC>The AOC intends to engage a qualified general contractor to perform all work as necessary to retrofit two emergency egress stairs within the United States Capitol Building.  Both stairways will be on the west side of the Capitol; one new stair will be on the House wing and the other will be on the Senate side.  Both shall be executed concurrently as the work area is easily isolated from the occupied areas of the building.  The creation of these two new stairways involves shoring, demolition, underpinning, and the subsequent construction of the new structure(s).   The new stairs themselves will be cast-in-place concrete with painted aluminum hand and guardrails.  It will be necessary to introduce two new exit doorways into the west face of the existing building structure.   These egress doorways will require the modification of the Capitol's existing historic stone facade.  Also part of the project is the related mechanical, electrical, storm drain, sprinkler, drywall and related architectural work.  Due to security concerns, access to the work site is restricted and closely controlled by the AOC and the USCP.  The solicitation will be issued on or about October 15, 2007.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be on or about November 16, 2007.  The solicitation will be available electronically at http://www.aoc.gov/business/procure-opps.cfm on the date of issuance.  INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO DOWNLOAD THE ELECTRONIC VERSION AS THIS WILL EXPEDITE RECEIPT OF THE SOLICITATION.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO MONITOR THIS SITE FOR ALL CHANGES!!  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Attendance at the site visit (date, time, etc. to be determined) is strongly encouraged!!

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD), Air Pollution Revention and Control Division (APPCD) requires a CFD modeling study to be performed on vertical furnace of an existing Multi-pollutant Control Research Facility (MPCRF) to study gasification of biomass for reburn to control NOx emissions.  The MPCRF is located in the High Bay of EPA's Research Triangle Park, NC Campus and its combustor (4 MMBtu/hr) can be operated on natural gas, fuel oil, or pulverized coal.   	The furnace  section is 20 ft in height and 3.5 ft in inner diameter, with a swirl burn installed at the top of the furnace.  The burner, designed by N.S. Harding Associates (Salt Lake City, UT), is patterned after the original movable block swirl burner developed by the International Flame Research Foundation  when it was located at Ijmuiden, Holland.    The furnace is designed to generate 1,000 SCFM flue gas at full firing rate.  The reburn system is required to contribute 20 percent of the total heat input to the MPCRF furnace (at 4 MMBtu full firing rate) with up to 65% NOx reduction.  This is not a  small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 541330.  Award will be made using a Best Value Analysis.  All responsible sources considering themselves qualified may submit a quote which shall be considered by the Agency.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing the required  commissioning must request a copy of the RFQ in writing within fifteen (15) days of electronic posting of this notice.  A pre-award/pre-proposal site visit may available for all interested potential contractors.  Requests should be submitted in writing to Courtney Whiting via email at  whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  Telephone responses and fax responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, in accordance with FAR Part 13,  a sole source procurement to Richard Stevens, 4213 Pulitzer Circle, Ellicott City, MD  21042-6244, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 41 U.SC. 253 ( C )( 1 ) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government anticipates the award of a time and material purchase order within (5) days after the response date of this notice. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be approximately twelve months. These consulting services will be performed on-site at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Baltimore, Maryland.  The contractor will provide analytic assistance to support CMS?s close-out (and transition period administration) of the legacy Medicare fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts.  The Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) procurements for Part A and Part B Medicare work will replace the Fiscal Intermediaries (Fls) and Carriers who currently process Part A and Part B Medicare claims.  At this time, only one of the 15 planned Part A and Part B MAC jurisdictions has been fully converted to a MAC.  A few of the remaining 14 jurisdictions have been awarded with the vast majority of the jurisdictions currently under evaluation.  Each MAC jurisdiction is comprised of several legacy contracts which all must end by 2011.  In the transitional environment, the legacy Fl and carrier contracts are presenting greater challenges than ever to administer, and approximately 50 legacy contracts must be closed out.  This workload is additive to the already significant level of effort required to simultaneously conduct MAC procurement evaluations and award the new MAC contracts while overseeing the complex operational transfer of FL and Carrier workloads to the newly awarded MACs.   CMS has determined that an outside expert for transition period activities is essential in order to obtain the expertise and special knowledge necessary to effectively analyze and execute legacy contract close-outs.  An expert-level of  knowledge of CMS? approach to interpreting and reimbursing contract transition and termination costs is required.  For this reason MCMG intends to procure the services of Richard Stevens as a subject matter expert in the area of Medicare Fiscal Intermediary and Carrier Contract close-outs.  He will also be able to provide invaluable assistance on other business and financial problems that have arisen with respect to the legacy Medicare contracts.   Mr. Stevens has over twenty five years of experience with the Office of Financial Management?s Transition Group for Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS). He has expertise with CMS? legacy Fl and carrier contract budget and cost reporting policies and procedures, and a significant experience in negotiating Fl and carrier transition and termination budgets which would make him the ideal candidate for this requirement.   This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested responsible sources may submit a description of their capabilities to perform within 5 days of this notice. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare Contractor Management Group shall make the determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise. Expressions of interest and statements of capabilities must be emailed to phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Apelon Systems Inc. 100 Danbury Road., Suite 201; Ridgefield, CT 06877; for one (1) Metaphrase Software License agreement.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $23M. The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.   

The NCI CBIIT is charged with providing the NCI with controlled scientific and clinical vocabulary.  The NCI is active in the area of vocabulary development and building infrastructure to make vocabulary available to the NCI and its information systems.  The NCI Enterprise Vocabulary System is a set of services and resources that address NCIs needs for controlled vocabulary.  In addition, this software provides access to many standard terminologies such as MeSH, ICD, SNOMED, and MedDRA, in a concept based environment that integrates the content of these terminologies and provides mapping from a term in one source that means the same as a (same or different) term in another source that means the same thing. 

The NCI Thesaurus, MedDRA, SNOMED/CT and other terminologies must be available on EVS servers in two forms: as a stand-alone vocabulary and in the NCI Metathesaurus.  Apelon Metaphrase is needed to make the NCI Metathesaurus available to NCI data systems.  This license gives NCI rights to publish the NCI Metathesaurus data through the Metaphrase API for 1 production and 1 backup production server, and several other non production tiers (Dev, QA and Staging).  NCI retains rights to NCI data, although anybody (including Apelon) can download the published NCI files in a standard RRF format.

Apelon Systems, Inc. is the only manufacturer of this license.  The NCI servers have been running this software since the 1990s.  There is no known software that is compatible.  In addition to a number freestanding application and users that use NCI Metaphrase and the Metaphrase browser directly, the whole caBIG infrastructure is dependent on Metaphrase services for annotating the common data elements with terminology.  It is critical to the NCI mission that this software is purchased from Apelon Systems, Inc.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months upon date of award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.<BR>The Army Corp of Engineers Kansas City District intends to make a  sole source award to a small business, Capital Sand Company, Inc, Jefferson City, Missouri 65110-4990<BR>Description of Supplies/Services: The objective of this contract is to procure a highly specialized service for emergency dredging support from river mile 0 through 240.  <BR>Background: The Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District is responsible for operation and maintenance of the authorized federal navigation channel on the Missouri River from Rulo, Nebraska to the mouth near St. Louis, Missouri.  Th e channel is designed and constructed as a self scouring channel, however the upper Missouri Basin has experienced severe drought conditions over last seven years, requiring water conservation measures that limit main stem flows to those which support only  minimum navigation service (reduced depth and width) for a shortened season.  Proper functioning of the system (including scouring and prevention of shoaling) is flow dependent. Regular scheduled maintenance activities do not include dredging. Dredging is  performed only as a last resort on an emergency basis when an actual shut down of the navigation channel has occurred or is eminent.  Due to the economic impacts of a stoppage of river traffic it is essential that dredging activities commence within 72 ho urs of the stoppage in order to restore navigation.  The navigation system is critical to the economy of the state of Missouri and also to the safety and environment. Each single barge (2 to 4 per typical tow) is equivalent to 58 large semi trucks on I-70 between St. Louis and Kansas City.  <BR>This work requires highly specialized experience and equipment which is extremely difficult and costly to obtain in the commercial marketplace. Under this emergency dredging scope of work, the contractor must submit acceptable bonds, and begin work onsite within 72 hours of an issuance of a Notice to Proceed. The new contract will provide for a transition period of at least 30 days to allow seamless service in the event that different contractor wins the next, full an d open solicitation to follow. <BR>The Contracting Officer anticipates the award of a small business set-aside, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) utilizing firm fixed price (FFP).  Services for this award are applicable under NAICS code 237990 . The period of performance for this contract will be for six months with a three month option and the option to extend service clause. The value of this contract will not exceed $500,000.00; the guaranteed minimum will be $1,000.00.<BR>Respondents shall s ubmit information to the Contracting Officer on official company letterhead detailing clear and convincing evidence of their technical expertise and how an award to any other source would meet the highly unique and specialized requirements of the USACE-KC District emergency dredging mission.  Submissions shall include affirmation of an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number or cage code and business size. The Contracting Officer will consider all corresponde nce received in response to this notice. Not withstanding the reference in numbered note 22, to a 45 day response.  The intent is to issue a sole source solicitation within (7) seven days of the publication of this notice, unless a basis for competition ex ists.  <BR>*Reference Numbered Note 22<BR><BR>Any responses to this notice shall be furnished electronically by 5:00 P.M. CST, Thursday, 7 February 2008 to the reference point of contact:<BR><BR>Contract Specialist:<BR>Kris Ann Huber<BR>Email:  kris.a.hube r@usace.army.mil<BR>Telephone Number: 816-389-3766<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Walla Walla District is issuing this proposed contract action for commercial supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) only one responsible source and  no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.    Currently, no other company can supply transmitters compatible with the existing HTI equipment due to their proprietary nature. HTI produces transmitters that utilize a proprietary coding strategy using multiple pulses to transmit the information to the receiver.  This relatively new coding strategy allows many more uniquely identifiable transmitters to broadcast on the same frequency. <BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within the next 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the G ovrenment.  A determination by the Government not to compete with proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determini ng whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Notice to determine if there are an adequate number of interested business concerns capable of providing acoustic tags in accordance with the at tached specifications within the required delivery period.   The Government will use the responses for information and planning purposes regarding the availability of commercial sources to provide Acoustic Transmitters for fish research.     Responses to this Request for Information / Sources Sought, are not offer s and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     See Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.215-3   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, at the end of this d ocument.<BR><BR>The Walla Walla District, U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers requires miniature acoustic transmitters for surgical implantation in juvenile salmonids to conduct fish passage and survival research at McNary Dam on the lower Snake Riv er, Washington.<BR><BR>Three separate specifications are attache d.     One is for spring evaluations in which the species to be tagged are juvenile steelhead and juvenile spring Chinook salmon.     The second is for summer evaluations in which fall Chinook juven iles will be outfitted with transmitters.     The third i s for use throughout the spring and summer study periods as beacons to be used for system integrity monitoring.     The Government may award up to three contracts   one for spring (juvenile steelhead and y earling Chinook salmon), and one for summer (subye arling Chinook salmon), and one for beacon tags.<BR><BR>In addition to the specifications attached, the manufacturer shall have a proven performance record of supplying large numbers (5,000+) of acoustic tr ansmitters for studies in large river systems to assess hydro-electric project passage behavior.

- CBP desires to obtain suitable accommodations at or below the GSA lodging rate corresponding to the locale of the selected contractor. CBP realizes however that market conditions may result in hotels not being able to offer such rates as needs arise and thus are requested to offer best possible rates for each requirement.

The hotel must be within 1/2 mile of an exit/interchange on either I-26 or I-526 and otherwise afford convenient access to I-26 and I-526. CBP prefers a location within the cities of North Charleston and Hanahan, west of the Cooper River, East or North of the Ashley River, and South of exit 209 on I-26 in order to afford convenient motor vehicle access to the Seaport areas and Charleston Airport under most traffic conditions, but will consider hotels in other areas.

Account Reconciliation:
CBP requests that the bill for all services be prepared in a logical and chronological sequence and that backup data accompany the invoice. The Contractor shall complete its accounting of the event and submit its invoice/statement within two weeks of the conclusion.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.

A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.

QUESTION:  Do you have the FAR that allows a physician to work at a Federal Facility with any state license. I know it is done all the time and is definitely allowable, I am just having difficulty finding the FAR that permits it. ANSWER:  A physician or anyone else can work at any VA as long as they have a valid license in ANY state.  There is no FAR reference. QUESTION:  We can provide the personnel to obtain Mammos, CT, DX, MRI, etc but we do not provide the equipment.  Is this a bid for both? ANSWER:  Yes, the Statement of Work (SOW) states:  "The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, facility, professional and technical personnel services to provide routine x-ray, mammography, and ultrasound studies for eligible veteran beneficiaries as referred by the Department of Veteran Affairs, Morehead City Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), 5420 Highway 70 West, Morehead City, NC, 28734."   QUESTION:  Could you please tell me the dollar value on each soliciations? and the number of exams performed?  I know in a previous question asked you stated that no historical numbers for diagnostic x-rays are available, but do you have a round about figure?   ANSWER:  We cannot share the result of the Government's independent cost estimate for these solicitations.  The figures contained in the Cost/Price Schedule are the Government's estimate for the number of exams to be performed.  No other data is available.

The hours or operation are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The USNA is a world-class Arboretum and desires to provide food service that complements and enhances the uniqueness, refinement, and enjoyment of the Arboretum experience.

<ARCHDATE>03092008
<CONTACT>STEPHANIE MOORE-COOK
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS), has a competitive requirement for software upgrade which would support MMS National Assessment of Undiscovered OCS Resources Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Section, is the contracting office for this procurement and the contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award one small business set-aside contract for this effort, and anticipates firm fixed price.  The estimated cost range is estimated between $27,000 - $28,000. INTRODUCTION:  The MMS National Assessment of Undiscovered OCS Resources used to prepare the 5-Year Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2007-2012 utilizes the Geological Resource Assessment Program (GRASP II), which includes peer review of the model, play definitions, and resource estimates.  The Geologic Interpretative Tools (GIT) software and methodologies form the basis of all MMS geological and geophysical evaluations and assures the quality of MMS?s technical evaluations.  ZEH Plot Express is the plot device interface software used to provide GIT plot output is integrated into GIT and has supported GIT plot output since 1991.  The ZEH Plot Express software requires upgrade to version v4.7 to support GIT plot output by new plotters.  MMS also requires the ZEH software be licensed for the newer Linux Platforms used at the Anchorage and GOMR locations.  MMS requires the Oil & Gas Enterprise package, Linux Licensing, CGM Extension, CGMage Builder, and Raster Import upgrades for their existing software for the two MMS locations listed above, to continue to provide required GIT plot output. ANALYSIS: The existing MMS infrastructure utilizes GIT from Geoquest and Landmark Systems.  These application tools have been in place and part of the MMS Resource Evaluation Post Lease Sale Analysis Process and the Leasing Lease Sale Process within the MMS TIMS applications since 1991.  The GIT Tools utilize the software product, ZEH, to allow MMS to produce CGM previews of film and paper plots for post analysis work, lease sale analysis, bid maps, public information displays, and work flow process reviews.  Existing hardware infrastructure was upgraded in 2007 with the addition of new HP4000 plotters requires that the ZEH software be upgraded.  ZEH software is integrated with all the existing processes and applications already deployed throughout MMS. CONCLUSION: MMS core applications use ZEH software to integrate 36 various application functions for MMS to produce plotting from the ESRI, and Technical Information Management System (TIMS) applications.  Evaluation of unproven sources would take several months, require a numerous variety of core application changes, be cost prohibitive to the Agency, and ultimately endanger the MMS Lease Sale schedule.  ZEH software upgrades and their continued subscription updates are required to provide critical continuity between core MMS applications and their output to support the MMS mission.  A MMS and ZEH Software Inc. SLA supports all current and future MMS ZEH product purchases, and because ZEH products are available only through the manufacture, MMS may procure ZEH software and updates through Sole Source procurement authority.   HOW TO RESPOND:   If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your name, organization?s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address by close of business Friday, February 08, 2008, to the attention of Stephanie Moore-Cook, Minerals Management Service, 1201 Elmwood Park Blvd., MS-2612, New Orleans, LA  70123, or email this same information to stephanie.moore-cook@mms.gov.

Project Title:  National Laboratory Certification Program

Project Description:  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration?s (SAMHSA)  Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to maintain the National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP).  The NLCP is the program that enables SAMHSA/CSAP to certify laboratories to perform forensic workplace urine drug testing pursuant to the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs published in the Federal Register (69 FR 19644, April 13, 2004).  The NLCP ensures that drug testing results reported by these certified laboratories for Federal agencies and industries regulated by the Department of Transportation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are scientifically and legally supportable.  There are 42 laboratories currently certified, with 3 of those being in Canada.  This contract will provide the technical evaluations and reports SAMHSA/CSAP requires to ensure complete oversight of the NLCP.  On a quarterly basis, the contractor will be required to prepare performance testing (PT) samples, analyze and report the results in a manner such that any necessary laboratory remedial actions can be accomplished prior to the shipping of the next set of PT samples.  The contractor must maintain a semi-annual laboratory inspection program using experts in Federal workplace drug testing laboratory science subject matter, prepare technical critiques from the inspection reports, issue the critiques to the laboratory in a manner such that any necessary laboratory remedial actions can be accomplished prior to the next inspection.  In addition, the contractor will develop and present laboratory inspector training workshops, and conduct various drug testing evaluation projects related to testing biological specimens and on-site drug testing devices, and conduct various administrative tasks.  The NLCP is a cost-recovery program.  The contractor collects various fees from participants to offset the costs associated with the certification process.  
The contractor must be able to expand the NLCP to meet any forthcoming revisions to the program as published in the Federal Register (69 FR 19673, April 13, 2004) that may include on-site and initial testing of urine and oral fluid, and comprehensive laboratory testing of oral fluid, sweat and hair for identified drugs of abuse.

The Enhanced Polar System (EPS) requirements are based on the requirements for Protected Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) in the North Polar Region.  EPS is the next generation SATCOM system that will replace the Interim Polar System (IPS).  The EPS program plans to have two EHF eXtended Data Rate (XDR) payloads in Molniya orbits and operational in the 2014/2016 timeframe.  

The EPS Gateway will provide the interface between Polar users and mid-latitude users via the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Global Information Grid (GIG) Point of Presence (PoP).  The major functions of the EPS Gateway will consist of: 1) two XDR based terminals with EPS upgrades for communication with the EPS payloads 2) automated transition of communications services from the descending payload to the ascending payload, 3) the gateway baseband equipment required to condition user traffic entering and leaving the gateway, 4) monitoring the gateway hardware status and health, and 5) an interface to the DISN GIG hardware.

The contractor will be responsible to design, develop, integrate and test the major functions of the EPS Gateway to include the following:
-	Perform a site survey and installation/checkout of a primary and secondary gateway sites.  
-	Conduct Developmental Test (DT) and End-to-End (E2E) tests with the user community in the 2011/2012 timeframe as the DISN core evolves.  
-	Have demonstrated experience with XDR communications, interfacing to the DISN, IP network services, and test.  
-	Responsible for all compliance requirements with regards to DoD IA practices, specifically DoDI 8500.2 series and  DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certification.  
-	Handle material up to DoD Secret and provide personnel with access to DoD Secret.  
-	Work closely with the EPS Government Systems Engineering Integration and Test (SEIT) team to orchestrate the successful development, deployment, and integration of the EPS gateway.  
  
An Industry Day is tentatively planned for second quarter Calendar year 2008 will be held to provide an overview of the EPS system, the gateway and the responsibilities of the Gateway Contractor.

Interested Gateway contractor candidates may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  Interested parties must submit an unclassified SOC no later than 3 March 2008.  Fully qualified sources will provide enough information to demonstrate they have performed systems engineering and integration on terrestrial satellite gateway efforts of similar complexity including contract type utilized (i.e., firm fixed, cost plus, etc.), have an understanding of MILSATCOM mission and future technology challenges, and can provide the capabilities listed above.  Interested contractors should address potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) in their SOC.  No real or perceived OCI can exist (Reference FAR 9.505-1).  The SOC shall not exceed 20 single sided pages in length.  All responses must conform to 8.5x11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged.  The NAICS code for this effort is 517919 with $23Million as the size standard.

<DESC>OBJECTIVE AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT

The Office of Infrastructure and Engineering in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT/I&E) will have technical management and responsibility for this Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The purpose of this Infrastructure Sector IQC is to provide ready access to short and long-term professional technical assistance and capacity building in the areas of energy, information and communications technology (ICT), roads and transport, water and urban issues to USAID Washington and USAID missions abroad in countries that are assisted by USAID.  The tasks awarded under this contract will support USAID?s objective of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in USAID-assisted countries.

This contract shall complement and reinforce the activities of the I&E Office, other USAID Washington Pillar/Technical Bureaus, USAID Regional Bureaus, and USAID Regional and Bilateral Missions.  The contractor shall provide professional services and experienced personnel with the specific skills sets required in IQC Task Orders.  

The Infrastructure Sector IQC will address the following sectors:

A.	Energy 

Expanding access to modern energy services empowers people to take a major step out of poverty into a better future.  Energy increases economic growth, employment opportunities, private sector investment, and competitiveness; strengthens democracy and fosters political stability through improved transparency and communication; enhances national security; improves quality of life by enabling better health care, education, and access to clean water; and protects the environment and public health.  Unfortunately, more than 2 billion people, or one-third of the world?s population, have no access to electricity or other modern forms of energy.  Expanding access to safe, affordable, efficient, reliable and clean energy to power economic and social development is the cornerstone of USAID?s energy mission.

B.	Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

Information and communications technology (ICT) has become a powerful tool in the fight against world poverty, providing developing countries with an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals, such as poverty reduction, basic health care, economic growth and education, far more effectively than before.  ICT depends on affordable access to telecommunications networks.  These include Internet (IP) networks as well as mobile phone networks, the latter increasingly being used for data applications as well as voice communications.  These networks can be used by the private sector, civil society and governments themselves.  Governments use ICT for e-government applications to improve the quality of services to citizens and businesses.

C.	Roads and Transport

In many countries, roads and highways provide the dominant mode of land transport and play a vital role in improving people?s lives and in contributing to national economic growth.  They often carry more than 80 percent of passenger-km and over 50 percent of freight ton-km in a country.  Consequently, roads and highways form the backbone to the economy and provide essential links to the vast local and community (rural) road networks.  Sea and air ports also provide important entry ways for the movement of goods and people.

D.	Water and Sanitation

Water is essential to life, and because over one billion people still lack access to safe water and nearly two billion lack safe sanitation, more than three million people die every year from avoidable water-related disease. Water security is a rapidly growing issue.  The poor are particularly vulnerable when water is either unclean or in short supply.  At the same time, water is a key development ingredient that impacts on a variety of factors that sustain and enhance life, as well as serving as a major input for industrial production (e.g., food processing). 

E.	Urban Management

Over 90 per cent of the world's population growth in the coming two decades will occur in developing cities - most of it in urban slums.  In the absence of sound governance and management practices, rapid urbanization will harm the environment.  It will also create life threatening water shortages, deplete valuable natural resources, strangle economic growth, widen income disparities and increase the spread of disease. However, well-managed cities can become engines of economic growth, enhance national prosperity, and increase both domestic harmony and international goodwill.  In a global and increasingly urbanized world, cities play a key role in building a better future.  Cities and local governments need the skills and tools to manage their resources effectively, deliver critical urban services, partner with the private sector, and foster economic growth for the betterment of their citizens.

<SUBJECT>70 -- IBM P520Q Server
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? IBM P520Q server used by Order Entry Management Systems (OEMS)to produce hard copy orders for patent and trademark documents. OEMS was originally designed using the IBM InfoPrint Manager solution, which interacts several customized OEMS application software modules and multiple IBM high-speed printers. The solution provides the maximum utilization of the equipment and increases efficiency by reducing processing time to fulfill the customers orders. Replacing the existing solution with different hardware and software will require a complete re-design of the system, which is time-consuming and not cost effective.
This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) among the existing USPTO Information Technology ID/IQ contractors.  No written solicitation will be issued as a result.  The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Connie Lum at (571)272-4167, or via E-mail at connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>58--GROUND/AIR TASK ORIENTED RADAR (G/ATOR) INCREMENT II SYSTEM DEVLOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman Systems, 1580A W. Nursery Road, Linthicum Heights, MD 21090 to provide a counterfire/target acquisition radar capability for the Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) as part of Increment II of the G/ATOR Program.  The contract will provide system development, integration, testing, and engineering services.  Contract options will include production of three G/ATOR Increment II Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems, Interim Contract Logistic Support (ICLS), Performance Based Logistics (PBL), Spare Parts, and a Technical Data Package (TDP).  The options for ICLS, PBL, Spare Parts and TDP will be a continuation of these services and information from Increment I to support Increment II.  The G/ATOR program is a single materiel solution for the Multi-Role Radar System (MRRS) requirement, including its appendix that describes Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) requ!  irements.  It is structured as an evolutionary acquisition program consisting of four discrete increments.  Each increment builds upon the capabilities of the preceding increments.  Northrop Grumman was competitively awarded the Increment I System Development and Demonstration contract in March 2007 for the Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) Air Surveillance missions.   Increment II will develop and produce systems based on the Increment I baseline to meet the ground counter battery/ target acquisition requirement.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1.  No RFP is available for competitive proposals.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>70 -- NetSim Software
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The Joint Communications Support Element, Bldg 861, 8532 Marina Bay Drive, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5101, requires Boson Netsim, CIS-NS-CCNP-02, Boson Netsim for CCNP 7.0/Single-User, Single computer licenses (Quantity 13) and License Server Access (Quantity 14).  Boson NetSim for CCNP utilizes a proprietary Virtual Packet Technology and is the manufacturer and sole proprietor of the multi-user/license server options.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Boson Software, LLC, 25 Century Blvd, Ste 500, Nashville, TN 37214-3679.  Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Wednesday, 6 February 2008, 10:00 a.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Wednesday, 6 February 2008, 10:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 
The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) currently utilizes the Boson NetSim CCNP system for extensive training of communications personnel on Cisco network infrastructure support equipment.  The complexity of the network infrastructure, the sensitivity of the JCSE network support and the nature of JCSE training require a seamless transition of training materials between the classroom and the field environment.  JCSE currently has the Boson system installed on 39 training systems at a cost of approximately $78,000.00 for hardware and software.  In addition, JCSE has invested over 240 man hours developing training materials required for system and network integration.  The cost to the Government of testing and installing a similar type of software, in terms of time and money, exceed any savings that would be achieved through competition of this requirement.

	FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items) (OCT 2003)
	FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items) (JUL 2005)

	FAR 52.232-33 (Payment by Electronic Funds-Central Contractor Registration) (OCT 2003)
	DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A (Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (NOV 2003)
	DFARS 252.232-7003 (Electronic Submission of Payment Request) (JAN 2004)
	DFARS 252.246-7000 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) (MAR 2003)

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 


Invoicing Instructions:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? or the ?Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)? option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the ?Invoice? option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

1	DESCRIPTION

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) strives to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  AHRQs core business includes the collection of health care data that can be used to inform health care quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness at the national, state and community level.  AHRQ routinely seeks input on the potential growth areas for future data collection efforts.  As part of that process, AHRQ is considering a solicitation to inventory all state-level data collection initiatives that could be used to inform quality improvement, public reporting, health care planning, patient safety, the value and efficiency of health care, health care effectiveness and performance, and clinical care management. State and community level health care data collection initiatives of interest include outpatient data, data on episodes of care, laboratory data, pharmaceutical data, long-term care data, and data used to inform performance measurement and/or quality improvement.  While some of these might be collected by government agencies, others might be collected by providers, vendors, foundations, and others within one or more states.

2	PURPOSE OF THIS RFI

Through this RFI, AHRQ is seeking responses to a set of questions (below) to determine the feasibility of obtaining information on state and community-level data collection initiatives in each state and the District of Columbia.

3	QUESTIONS
3.1	Does at least one state-level health data collection initiative exist within the state?
3.2	Is information on these state-level health care data collection initiatives available in the public domain?
3.3	What types of information about these initiatives are available in the public domain?
3.4	How can information about health data collection initiatives be obtained from the public domain?
3.5	What state and/or private agencies and/or organizations would be knowledgeable about state-level health data collection initiatives?
3.6	What are existing inventories of state-level health care data collection initiatives?
3.7	What sources have the names and contact information of state-level health care data collection initiatives?

4	SUBMISSION DIRECTIONS

Written responses should be directed to Jessica Alderton, Contracting Officer by e-mail at Jessica.Alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov no later 12:00pm (noon) EST on Friday, February 15, 2008.

<SUBJECT>--**Request for Information (RFI) Only** - US Army Dental Command (DENCOM) Reserve Component Mobilization Referral Program (RC-MRP) for Dental Provider Network System
<DESC>This requirement is for a network of qualified dental providers and is not a personal service contract for a recruitment of dentists.  The qualified dental provider network shall consist of private civilian dentists to perform routine and emergent de ntal treatment within their private offices as directed by a treatment plan provided by the Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) dental station in order to remove a Reserve Component (RC) Soldier from a Dental Class 3 deployment status into a minimum of a De ntal Class 2 deployment status.  The Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) Army, through the United States Army Dental Command (DENCOM), operates SRP dental stations at mobilization platforms located within the continental United States (CONUS).  The primar y purpose of the CONUS SRP dental station is to process and validate the deployment dental readiness of Army RC Soldiers.  The Army RC consists of Component 2 Soldiers from the Army National Guard (ARNG) and Component 3 Soldiers from the United States Army  Reserve (USAR).  In addition, service members from sister military services (Navy, Marines, and Air Force) may process through Army SRP dental stations.  To be dentally deployable into the theatre of war, Soldiers must have a Dental Class 1 or 2 dental re adiness deployment status, as defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) dental readiness policy.   If a Soldier is identified as having a Class 3 dental readiness deployment status, the dental disease causing the status must be treated to a minimum of a C lass 2 status for the Soldier to be deployable.  Dental care at a SRP dental station must occur within days or weeks of the initial arrival date to the mobilization platform in order for the RC Soldier to train and deploy with their unit.  The number of se rvice members referred to the local provider network at any of the SRP dental stations approved to use the Reserve Component Mobilization Referral Program (RC-MRP) is dependent upon the number of RC Soldiers mobilizing through that station, the status of t heir dental readiness when they present to that SRP dental station, and the SRP dental stations capability to treat the RC Soldiers within their facilities.  Primary site locations to be serviced include:  Camp Atterbury, IN; Camp Shelby, MS; Ft. Dix, NJ;  Ft. McCoy, WI; Ft. Benning, GA; Ft. Bliss, TX; Ft. Bragg, NC; Ft. Hood, TX; Ft. Jackson, SC; Ft. Lewis, WA; Ft. Riley, KS; Ft. Sill, OK; and Ft. Stewart, GA.  The contractor shall provide a dentist provider network that has office locations as close to th e SRP dental station as possible, but cannot exceed more than 35 miles from the SRP dental station.  We encourage small businesses to reply with evidence of their capabilities to provide a qualified dentist provider network consisting of private civilian d entists who can provide dental services in accordance with the precepts of the American Dental Association (ADA), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) Manual, and by the professional standards of the initiating SRP denta l station for the referral.  Request interested parties provide information as to their capabilities and experience in providing similar services to the points of contact listed below, via email or FAX, not later than 14 February 2008 in order for the Gove rnment to develop a course of action.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.

<SUBJECT>--ARMY MODULAR GLOVE SYSTEM, MENS AND WOMENS.
<DESC>The Product Manager- Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (Natick, MA) has a need to identify possible commercially available glove systems for U.S. Army.  The Army Modular Glove System is intended to pro tect the soldiers hands from temperatures of 20o F to +40o F.  The Army Modular Glove System shall be a collection of gloves (3 layers) that offer various levels of cold protection with various other environmental protective properties.  The individual i tems can be selected by the user to wear either alone or layered according to the manufacturers recommended layering of components.  This modular system shall allow the wearer to choose the gloves that are required based on the need for insulation, wind p rotection, water resistance, full waterproof protection, heat and melt resistance, flexibility and tactility.  These lightweight components shall be shells or shells with removable insulations that allow for quick drying and individual replacement.  The Ar my Modular Glove System is envisioned as a modular system consisting of perhaps five (5) components, worn in up to (3) layers. (Removable liners considered separate component.) The Government is conducting a Market Investigation seeking product informati on and/or samples of innovative off-the-shelf or non-developmental solutions for evaluation in the year 2008/ 2009.  The intent of this market survey is to see modern versions of these gloves using state-of-the-art materials and design features.  We will b e technically testing materials of these commercial items to determine the best performance available.  Results from this evaluation will be used to write a Military specification.  When submitting for U.S. contracts, offers are cautioned that their produc ts (all materials and manufacturing) must comply with Berry Amendment restrictions (see DFARS 252.225-7012).  Product shall meet the following critical performance requirements:  (1) Three separate glove layers:  Base layer (next to skin, no melt/stick glo ve liner,) Layer 2 (highly wind and water resistant/ water proof, wet weather protection,) Layer 3 (Extreme cold weather glove with insulation, wet weather protection).  (2) Combination of gloves that provide environmental protection in temperature range: 0-40 ? F. (3) Quick drying layers.  (4) Minimum service life of 120 days and have a minimum shelf life of 5 years without being affected by mold, fungus, rot, etc.  (5) Subdued in color.  (6) Provide maximum moisture vapor transmission rate/ breathability and comfort.  (7) Provide wrist adjustability and a means to attach the gloves to an item.   (8) Five sizes or less shall properly fit the central 90% of the military population based on the 5th percentile female through the 95th percentile male soldier ha nd measurements.  (9) Uniform compatibility.  The following objective performance requirements are desired:  (1) Maximum dexterity and tactility.  (2) Flame protection.  (3) Reduce bulk.  (4) Ergonomic finger construction.  Testing:  Samples submitted may be technically tested by the Government for the above requirements; however, not restricted to only these.   Interested firms are requested to submit information (i.e. identify materials used in the development) on their product(s) within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis.  Additional information should include, but not limited to, product cost, technical information (e.g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM, AATCC), certification/ complian ce, warranty terms, relevant company background/experience, ISO 9000 certification, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value of their product(s) and ability to meet the requirements.  Companies are also encouraged to submi t minimum of 1 sample (size Large) for evaluation NLT 15 February 2008, but are not required to.   Initial information and samples submitted will not be return ed, and no payment will be made by the Government for sample submitted.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Justification.
Data Domain's DD460 provides the best combination of physical foot print, base storage capacity, scalability, data throughput, and data compression.  The Data Domain DD460 is the only product that provided all of the following:  

Inline deduplication in a storage appliance - data is not written to disk until after it is deduplicated, or redundant segments removed. This inline approach minimizes number of disk drives needed and supports replication to take place during the backup window for faster off-site protection.

Automatic verification of backups to enable verify feature to be disabled in backup software which will increase backup performance.
                
RAID-6 protection against dual drive failures.
                
Protect current investment of existing backup software.

<DESC>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting offers from interested parties regarding industry capability to provide periods of short-term, rapid analysis of current and planned system hardware, architecture and integration of man-portable combat controller equipment and software.  The contractor would analyze technical specifications, drawings and actual hardware and software carried by Air Force combat controllers.  This equipment includes tactical radios, computers, portable electrical power, tactical headsets, head-mounted displays, situational awareness software, small/micro unmanned aerial vehicles and laser range finders and target designators.  Responses will influence the award of a one-year (with four (4) one year options) multi-vendor blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to supply all or portions of the types of analyses listed above and in paragraph 3.
2.  In October 2007, this office posted a sources sought notice for this effort and received several responses.  This notice asks those interested parties to submit current rate information for the purpose of evaluation.  This office intends to award one or more blanket purchase agreements as a result of receiving this information.  Tasks on the BPAs will be awarded on an ?as needed? basic after the initial BPAs are awarded.  However, based on cost and other considerations, the Government reserves the right not to award a contract at all. 
3.  As a reminder of what was posted in the October RFI:  The respondent shall have an existing facility with a current capability to bring together all the above hardware systems and evaluate the system architecture and integration.  Additionally, the respondent must have demonstrated experience providing this support to other similar military systems involving tactical equipment intended for use on the modern battlefield.  The respondent must also show the ability to recommend and implement changes to the system architecture/integration to correct technical deficiencies or to optimize total system performance.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Description of requirement for the services to be acquired:


FURNITURE MAINTENANCE SERVICES
Statement of Work (SOW)


1.0	Background:

DFAS Columbus was designed and built to utilize Steelcase ?Context? systems furniture, which was installed approximately 10 years ago.   In addition to the systems furniture there are offices constructed of movable Clerestory walls, as well as UNICOR furniture and limited quantities of other brands.   The existing movable walls were manufactured by Clestra Hauserman.  The new Steelcase walls are called Pathways.   Movement of other furniture would only be as a result of an overall Steelcase furniture move.  Approximately 3,900 work stations are located in Columbus ranging in size from 6 x 6 work stations to 240 square foot walled offices.  The furniture is located in a 7 story building located on the Defense Supply Center Columbus base.  DFAS Columbus continues to be a dynamic organization with reorganizations and changing requirements that require reconfigurations and movement of furniture often with short turnaround times.

2.0	Objective/Scope of Work:

The purpose of this requirement is to provide a comprehensive furniture movement and maintenance program that includes all labor, equipment and supervision necessary to facilitate the evaluation, design, disassembly, movement, storage, inventory, reassembly and maintenance of furniture located at DFAS Columbus.  The contractor is required to be familiar with Steelcase furniture and installation and have the ability to obtain Steelcase parts and pieces or equivalent piece parts that will fit and match the Steelcase Context furniture.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to explain how the non-Steelcase parts will satisfy the fit and match requirement.  The Government reserves the right to visually inspect non-Steelcase parts and pieces before installation to ensure they meet the form fit and function and match existing furniture.    These parts may be required to complete the reconfiguration of existing furniture at a new location.    Orders for services will be issued on an as needed basis. 

3.0	Requirements/Tasks:

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:

3.1  The contractor shall apply, install, or maintain Steelcase products or equal in accordance to published manufacturer?s instructions and guidelines in order to maintain the Lifetime Warranty of the existing furniture.
       
        The Government does not have the facilities to store new piece parts while waiting for them to be added to a new reconfiguration nor desires to take on administrative functions of receipting, warehousing and the liability that could exist in having damaged parts.  

3.2.  The contractor will be required to identify and provide missing piece parts to make the workstation fit its new reconfiguration.  A combination of piece parts from the warehouse as well as new product may need to be added.  The extent of missing piece parts needed will depend on the reconfiguration.  The missing piece parts will need to be Steelcase or an equivalent that fits the existing Steelcase workstation in form, fit and function.  The salient characteristics of the parts is that they fit and operate within the existing Steelcase workstations and furniture.  The reconfiguration being done is an unknown.  The Government does not have the technical expertise to identify these missing pieces and will be in reliance on the contractor?s expertise.

3.3 The contractor?s move management service shall provide complete coordination of all furniture moves to include initial walkthroughs, drawing approvals, scheduling of installation crews, project updates, and project completion inspection and approvals.  

3.4  The government will provide copies of all available building drawings of the area(s) to be moved or refit with furniture.  These drawings will be best available drawings of the space, including potential locations of electrical hook-ups.  If a particular move involves furniture other than Steelcase, the contractor shall develop existing drawings based on the workstation standards of the particular manufacturer.  The contractor will verify field measurements and develop new floor plans by area.  The new floor plans will consist of existing typical work stations.  Typical workstation cluster interior components, i.e., work surfaces, overhead units, storage, etc., can change, providing they are not panel dependent, or the panel dimension will support the different workstation configuration.

3.5	Inventory and Storage:

3.5.1  Should the movement require interim storage, the contractor shall adequately protect all fabric-covered items.  All warehoused items will be separated by cardboard, but not necessarily individually cartoned. 

3.5.2  The contractor shall provide an inventory list of the items to be placed in storage.  As items are pulled and removed from storage, the contractor shall provide a separate list for those items and update inventory listings.   

3.5.3  The contractor shall perform an inventory of parts and pieces as requested by the government to determine the type and number of work stations that can be constructed from the parts and pieces in storage.

3.5  Following a request for furniture movement, an inventory of the existing panels and connectors will be taken by the contractor in each cluster to be moved in order to ensure they are reinstalled correctly.  The storage inventory will be reviewed for any needed parts and pieces required to fit the workstation at the new location.  Any missing components, including modifications to the wiring system and/or preset locations, will be identified by the contractor to the contracting officer?s representative in writing so acquisition of these components by the contractor or the government can be accomplished.  Once the new drawings are approved, a schedule for tear down and reinstallation will be established with the contractor?s project manager and the contracting officer or designated representative.  Workstations will then be reinstalled accordingly.   No work shall be performed until the government has approved the schedule, drawings and quote.

3.6  It is understood that the reconfiguration of furniture may result in damaged or inoperative wire and power management systems.  It is the intention of the government to retrofit this older furniture during the reconfigurations to mate to the cellular deck wiring system and presets or to the available wiring systems in the other buildings to the maximum extent possible to standardize the wire management system in DFAS occupied areas.  The contractor will be required to provide new and replacement parts for the furniture located in all DFAS occupied areas, as directed by the contracting officer.  This includes Steelcase and other brands as identified above.  The government may elect to provide the contractor with components from other brands for contractor installation.

3.7   The government will clean the area and the location will be free of debris prior to installation.  The government, before dismantling of furniture systems, will disconnect all electrical connections to the building source.  The contractor shall be responsible for the disconnecting of electrical wiring within the systems furniture.  All data and communications cabling will be removed from the systems furniture before dismantling, and reinstalled in the new location by the government.  All workstation contents including files, paper, binders, personal items, electronic equipment, phones, etc., will be removed from the area by the government before the disassembly begins.

3.8  A pre-disassembly inspection walk-through with the contractor and the government will take place to determine the condition of the product and findings shall be annotated.

3.9 The project will be considered complete when the furniture is completely reassembled, the internal electrical system has been connected, all debris created by the contractor is removed and final inspection of the required work is complete.  Final connection to the building source is the responsibility of the government; however, testing of the internal wiring system is the contractor?s responsibility.

3.10 Furniture Repair and Touch-up:

3.10.1  The contractor shall protect new fabric furniture through the application of stain protection treatments, as directed by the contracting officer?s representative.  Fabric protection chemicals may be applied in unoccupied areas during normal business hours, however, in occupied areas it must be applied after hours.  MSDS sheets are required.

3.10.2   The contractor, as directed by the contracting officer, shall extend the life and improve the appearance of wooden furniture.  This shall be accomplished through repair and wood/steel touch-up, to restore an item to at least 80% (or as agreed upon between the contractor and the contracting officer), of its original condition by toning, applying surface filler, and using the proper finish to match the existing piece.  Each item will be addressed on an individual basis and all expectations will be agreed upon before the process begins.

3.10.3  The contractor shall repair and/or clean all damaged or soiled work station surfaces as requested by the Contracting Officer.  The repairs shall take no more than 32 hours or involve 200 SF of painting.   While working in the building, adjacent work surfaces will be protected from damage or soiling.

3.11  The work will be performed during normal business hours of Monday through Friday; 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM unless directed to be performed after duty hours.  Loading dock access will be provided.


4. Delivery/Performance Schedule:

               Task	            Deliverable	    Delivery Schedule

<DESC>SOLICITATION M08-PS-00009 Minerals Management Service (MMS) Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) Resource Evaluation Group (RE) Advisory & Assistance Services Seismic Data Interpretation The purchase order to be awarded and all line items will be performed in accordance with Attachment 1 SOW, Terms & Conditions and Clauses. Clauses Incorporated by Attachment:  This purchase order will incorporate the statement of work, terms & conditions and clauses by attachment with the same force and effect as if they were included in the contract document itself.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is M08-PS-00009.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This is a 100% Small Business set-aside under NAICS 541360, $4.5M; SIC 1382; and PSC B518. The Resource Evaluation (RE) group in Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for seismic interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic reflection data, mapping, and prospect and play development.  The interpretation process also includes the incorporation of data and interpretations from previously drilled exploration wells (well logs, cuttings and cores), knowledge of the regional geology, petroleum geology and geophysical data (gravity, magnetic, and geothermal when available).  Prospective horizons and regionally significant horizons are interpreted on the seismic reflection data.  The travel time values are spatially gridded, and then the grids are displayed as contour maps in time, which are ultimately converted to depth.  The end result is the creation of maps identifying possible accumulations of hydrocarbons.  These accumulations may be in structural or stratigraphic traps.  Risked reservoir parameters are then assigned to the strata comprising the trap, and a risked generation, migration and trapping scenario is developed.  The end product is the risked resource in the trap as well as its monetary value. The MMS RE office in Anchorage, Alaska requires Advisory & Assistance Services for seismic interpretation, mapping, and prospect and play development in the Chukchi Sea Planning Area.   The MMS-RE team conducts all of its mapping activities with Schlumberger GeoFrame v4.3 software.  Team members use a variety of other software when recording progress and preparing interim and final reports, including Badley?s MindShare v2.3 and Microsoft Office 2003 Word and Excel. The MMS uses data provided to it by various companies in the oil industry.  These data and the interpretations and conclusions drawn from them are proprietary to the Federal government under the provisions of the OCS Lands Act. SECTION B CLIN 0001 Seismic Data Interpretation Interpret 2-D and 3-D multi-channel seismic reflection data in the time domain Generate maps of the interpretation Work with team members to convert time maps to depth maps. Delineate prospects based on the interpretation and maps Provide reservoir parameters with distributions for computing risked volume Interim and final oral reports will be given to the rest of the team.

Travel by the contractor for original arrival to and final departure from the MMS-AK office is not included in this line item and will not be paid for by the Government.   The contractor will not be paid an hourly rate for time spent traveling.   The contractor will be paid travel per diem rates only for actual travel days.  Travel per diem rates will NOT be paid on days the contractor provides services working on site at the MMS-AK office. Travel payment will be made in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations based on 41CFR 300-304 which implements statutory requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at government expense.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

<DESC>FA4452-08-R-0003 HIGH DECK PATIENT LOADING PLATFORM VEHICLES
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
January 31, 2008


1. Cabin Boarding Stairs.   Can you provide additional information?  Is a side entrance door for the operator to enter and exit the main body area required, or, to enter, the operator unfolds the lift gate at the back end and enters thru the sliding doors?

ANSWER:  A way to access the cabin deck is needed so that the lift gate operators can get up to the cabin without having to use the lift gate (What if the lift gate isn?t operable?  A separate door into the cabin isn?t needed, but a way to get up to the sliding cabin door without the lift gate is required)

2.  Generator.  The spec calls for gasoline powered 10KW generator.  Do you mean an Onan model CMQD Quiet Diesel?

ANSWER:  Diesel fuel type for the generator

3.  Rear Lift.  Lift is called out in two places.  The 1st place is page 5 under general vehicle/van body.  The 2nd is on page 7.  Is the correct description on page 7?

ANSWER:  Page 7 is the correct statement on gurney/litter lift.

4.  Are you providing the gurneys or do we need to quote that also?
Also we need specs on the gurneys either way so that we can find the appropriate gurney racks that are called for.

ANSWER:  Gurney's aren't the requirement, litters are.  HDPLP requires the ability to carry 9 NATO standard litters.  These should be on a rack, so the litters are not floor loaded.  A three high litter rack system is the standard in AE operations.  Litter arms must accommodate the standard NATO litter and be capable of supporting 375 pounds per position.  Litter racks can be manufactured, or procured from a commercial company.  Specific dimension information is listed in the NATO Standardization Agency Agreement, Subject:  Stretcher, Bearing and Brackets and Attachment Support. 


5.    Is it your intention to leave the rear lift gate in a unfolded deployed state? Or, do you intend to fold up the lift gate against the back of the body when moving the vehicle? If you intend to fold it up when moving it, keep in mind the handrails would have to be installed or removed each time.

ANSWER:  The rear lift gate is lifted against the back of the body when vehicle is moved.  Prior to movement, the handrails are folded down and secured to the rear lift platform.  This is IAW the vehicle training plan.

6. Does the Government have a current blanket EPA exception in effect for the vehicles to be offered in response to the subject solicitation? This request/clarification is in respect to compliance with the paragraph titled Diesel Engine in attachment 1 of the HDPLP specifications. 


ANSWER:  See attached "EPACT".

7. How should the pricing be stated. Is there a form SF 1449? Or another form to list this on?

ANSWER:  There is no SF1449.  Propose pricing per vehicle in your proposal.

8.  Under Wheels and Tires on page three it states that 7 of the tires will be mounted on aluminum allow type wheel and one of the 7 wheels will be the spare tire.  Does this mean that the 4 inside tires on the rear axles will remain on the standard steel wheel or should this read 11 tires will be on aluminum wheels?

ANSWER:  Eleven (11) tires should be mounted on aluminum wheels.  Originally vehicle was to have only 7 (6 + 1 spare) wheels, but weight of vehicle bumped requirement to 11 (10 + 1 spare).

9. What is the current MIL-STD number for Noise?

ANSWER:  Attached is the MIL-STD 1474 basically if the noise pollution is 85db or higher you must ensure people are wearing hearing protection.  I also included link to the OSHA standard and it correlates to the same

A)  To activate the water sprayer from the truck so one does not have to get in-out to turn on the water while spraying down the roads. This is just an add on that makes it safer and easier on one person doing the dust control on roads.  2. Q) What is the purpose of the dual spray heads? A)  It can be one I guess as long as it sprays 30ft wide to cover the entire road in one pass. Most I talked to thought theirs sprayed 15 ft per head so it would take 2 heads to cover one 30ft road.  3. Q)  Are the hoses like a canon hose on a fire truck or something one person can hold and spray in terms of power? A)  The fire hose attachment was to get all the hoses listed below for self loading of the tank from a standing water supply and to wash down equipment on the yard with more.  4. Horsepower.  Using the formulas for determining horse power requirements, we calculate that a 10 horse power gas engine is required to pump 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  Please advise what the correct specification should be. Please submit your quote based on your companies recommended formula for required horsepower for a gas engine pump based on the following specs: 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  5.  Q) When it says ý30 foot wide spray capabilityý, does this mean 15 foot from either side of the center line of the trailer?  A)  On the 30 ft wide spray, it can be 15 ft from center line of trailer each way for a total of 30 ft of coverage.<BR><BR>Attachment with descriptions and pictures.<BR><BR>All Vendor questions must be received in writing by 1200PM EST on Thursday January 31st 2008<BR><BR>Solictation reposted to promote competition.

<DESC>Questions and Answers about F1TBAM7338A001-A

1.	The drawing for the small blast box pin does not state material or quantity.
Answer: We don't ask that they quote the pins for the box. We are able to make the pins ourselves. Vendors need to keep in mind that the only parts that need to be quoted for both boxes are the edges and walls only. The edges and walls are just parts of the blastbox, and not the blastbox in its entirety. 

2. The small blast box insert box, no method of attachment. Stated as a protruding feature, how far does it protrude?
 Answer: Again, we do not ask to have these items quoted. All we need are the edges and walls for both the small and large blastboxes.

3. Small blast box, long wall, 16.80" wide slot 2 places, is this correct?
 Answer: Yes, there are two slots that don?t go all the way through the material. 

4.On walls, edges and mating parts, the clearance listed ranges from 1/8-1", is this correct?
 Answer: The clearances do vary between parts, but we are not aware of any 1" clearances.

5. No finish requirements are listed for machined parts.
 Answer: As long as there aren?t any finishes so rough that it will injure someone to touch them, we are okay with the finish the material comes with.

6. If there are no callouts for radius or chamfered corners, we would normally assume .030" break on edges.
 Answer: The back of the wedges for the small blast box calls for a 1/4"X45degree chamfer. We would like for all the back edges of all edges to have this feature.

7. No revision on drawings, only one rev?
 Answer: You are right - there are no revisions.

8. No insert box listed for Large blast box, is this correct?
 Answer: There is no insert box for the large box. Again, vendors should only be quoting the edges and walls, not the entire box.

9. Any drawings of assembled boxes available?
 Answer: No assembly drawings available, but we do have bitmaps showing how all of it goes together. You may request the bitmaps by contacting Ms. Mary Gardner mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil.


All other terms and conditions remain the same.
