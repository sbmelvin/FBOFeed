<SUBJECT>Software for Analysis of Scientific Echo Sounder Data
<SOLNBR>NFFN76001017157KLC
<RESPDATE>082710
<ARCHDATE>08282010
<CONTACT>Karen L Christian, Ciontract Specialist, Phone (816)426-7286, Fax (816)274-6952, Email karen.l.christian@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have a requirement for Software for Analysis of Scientific Echo sounder Data. The requirement will be purchased as a sole brand name for Echoview software. The NMFS wants to purchase the software to analyze data collected from scientific echo sounders to estimate the biomass of plankton, squids, and fish. Background: Fisheries acoustics is a developing tool to improve assessment of fish stocks and evaluation of the total biomass of pelagic plankton, fish, and squids. Acoustic studies employ scientific echo sounders that work in a manner similar to commercial fish finders. Sound is transmitted through the water column from a transducer mounted on the ship, and the strength of the echoes sounds are measured to determine the amount of fish or other organisms that are in the water column. These tools are used to improve assessment of fish stocks in cases where other methods of quantifying fish are not effective (Simmonds and MacLennen, 2005). For marine mammal habitat studies, acoustic tools provide a continuous record of the amount of potential prey in the water column. Marine mammals are highly mobile predators that are thought to closely track the movement of their prey. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center has been developing the capability to incorporate fisheries acoustics studies into marine mammal surveys over the last several years.
<p>Both the NOAA ships Pisces and Gordon Gunter are equipped with split-beam scientific echo sounders (Simrad EK60) operating at four frequencies: 18 kHz, 38 kHz, 120 kHz, and 200 kHz. Of these, the 18 and 38 kHz will be useful in measuring acoustic backscatter from targets in the operational depth of the mid-water trawls. In addition, the Pisces has a multi-beam echo sounder (ME70) which operates in the 70-120 kHz range. The ME70 configuration includes a "reference beam" that operates at 73 kHz in a mode similar to the single frequency echo sounders. During marine mammal assessment surveys, these echo sounders are configured to allow multi-frequency comparison of acoustic backscatter. Multi-frequency methods are particularly useful for discriminating between different types of targets (e.g., swim-bladdered vs. non swim-bladdered fish) based upon relative differences in target strength at different frequencies (e.g., Jech and Michaels 2006, Benoit-Bird et al. 2009).</p>
<p>The analysis of acoustic data collected during these surveys is highly technical. Many steps are required to adequately characterize the biomass and identity of fish, squids, and other organisms from acoustic data. These include the identification and tracking of individual targets, filtering and cleaning data to remove erroneous signals and noise, echo integration of the total backscatter at multiple frequencies and the development of classification tools to identify targets based on their frequency spectra. Specially designed scientific software is necessary for this complex set of analyses. The purpose of the software is for the scientific analysis of scientific echo sounder data collected using SimRad EK60 split-beam and ME70 multi-beam echo sounders. Requirements: A software package is required that can analyze raw data produced by split-beam echo sounders. Required capabilities include: 1) processing of raw data to evaluate signal-to-noise-ratio and remove erroneous signals, 2) individual target identification and tracking, 3) echo integration tools to quantify back-scatter in discrete depth layers, 4) ability to perform multi-frequency target classification, 5) ability to display and analyze data from multi-beam echo sounders.</p>
<p>The software Echoview is the scientific standard state-of-the-art tool used to process split-beam and multi-beam scientific echo sounder data. It is the routinely used software for these types of highly complex and technical analysis, and is used by other NOAA line offices including the Northeast and Northwest Fisheries Science Centers, both of which has well-developed fisheries acoustics programs. Many of the routines for the types of analyses that we need to perform are already written for the Echoview software. Echoview also reads the native "RAW" data format produced by the Simrad EK60 echo sounders deployed on the two vessels routinely used by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center. The Echoview software is the state-of-the-art tool for the analysis of scientific echo sounder data for fisheries acoustics. Most of the routines used to analyze such data were developed specifically for Echoview. The software is also used at other NOAA Fisheries science centers where fisheries acoustics is a well-developed tool for stock assessment. The Echoview software is the only tool available to conduct these types of analyses. The Government has conducted market research and found there are no other software packages that meet their requirements. To be considered interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide software that will meet the Government's requirements. Firms must furnish detailed specifications and descriptions to demonstrate their capability to provide software that would satisfy the Government's needs. Capability information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have previously furnished this supply, and detailed narrative that describes you ability to provide this supply as specified and descriptive literature. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government knows of only one source that can provide the software Myriax Software, Inc. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. However, all responses received within 7 calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511. Responses may be sent to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Eastern<br />Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For information and to register, please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<CONTACT>Karen L Christian, Contract Specialist, Phone (816)426-7286, Fax (816)274-6952, Email karen.l.christian@noaa.gov
<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT: The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Region Acquisition Division-Kansas City (ERAD-KC) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) intend to procure for Training and Advise SEFSC) Stock Assessment Staff on the Quantitative Methods of Technical Writing. Scope of Work: Fisheries science is becoming increasingly quantitative and new statistical, mathematical and computational methods are continually being developed for studying population dynamics and assessing stocks. There is thus a critical need for government scientists to maintain and improve their quantitative skills and to adopt the latest methods. At the same time, there is increased need for scientists to document and communicate their scientific findings to peers and to the general public. New methods can be introduced to government scientists, and new approaches can be developed, by providing training to government scientists and by engaging outside experts in collaborative projects so that technology and knowledge can be both developed and transferred. Government scientists' communication skills can also be developed by providing training in technical writing. Objectives: 1) Provide training to Government scientists in state of the art quantitative methods and in technical writing; and 2) Develop collaborative research projects that create new quantitative methods and apply the new methods to real fisheries problems. Description of Work: The trainer will visit the National Marine Fisheries Service's Miami Laboratory three times for a period of 8-10 days each time. During each visit, the trainer will provide a short course on a technical topic or on technical writing. The three short courses are:
<p>1) Statistical and graphical analysis in R (4 days). Course presupposes no previous knowledge of R and covers: data input and output, basic syntax, built-in functions, error messages, sub-setting and manipulating and summarizing data, graphing data, conditional execution and loops, writing functions, finding information. Statistical methods covered will include linear models, generalized linear models, nonlinear regression, optimization and maximum likelihood estimation, bootstrapping. The trainer will provide materials for reference and for continuing education (for use after the course ends).</p>
<p>2) Technical writing for scientific journals and reports (2 days). A systematic approach enabling rapid writing of a scientific paper is presented. Pitfalls to writing are identified and steps to overcoming these problems are presented. In-class writing exercises are used to enable participants to gain proficiency in the techniques.</p>
<p>3) Mathematical statistics for fishery biologists (4 days). Basic concepts in mathematical statistics are explained and illustrated using examples from fisheries science. Topics include: mathematical expectation, bias, variance, mean squared error, covariance, independence, sampling error, maximum likelihood, bootstrapping.</p>
<p>The trainer will also work with scientists from the Miami Laboratory on a variety of collaborative research projects including design of a fishery survey in St. Croix, development of a multispecies mortality estimator and other mortality estimators based on mean length, interpretation of spatial data on commercial catch rates in a fishery, and other topics raised by NMFS scientists. Deliverables: 1) Presentation of three short courses of up to 3 days duration along with all class notes, computer codes, and sample datasets used in the courses; and 2) A separate report on each collaborative research project identified above. Evaluation Criteria: 1) Experience teaching population dynamic and stock assessment; 2) Experience teaching technical writing for peer0reviewed journals; 3) experience teaching advanced courses in statistical and graphical analysis in R language; 4) Demonstrated ability to develop statistically efficient sampling programs; 5) Experience conducting stock assessments for marine fish and invertebrates; and 5) Demonstrated record of scientific excellence as evidenced by numerous publications in scientific journals on statistics, fish population dynamics and stock assessments.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority 41 USC 253(c) (1). Dr. John Hoenig with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science offers the expertise to conduct the training for the stock assessment program. Dr. Hoenig has a Master's degree in statistics and a dozen publications in statistical journals such as Biometrics, American Statistician, and Environmetrics as well as in the Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences. He also has a doctorate in biology oceanography (fisheries) and 85 additional peer reviewed publications in biological journals. He has taught mathematical statistics, computer simulation modeling, stock assessment methods, and statistical and graphical analysis in R. He has also developed a teaching module for technical writing for scientific journals. Dr. Hoenig is an expert in stock assessment methods and a Centre of Disciplinary Expertise in stock assessment and survey methodology for the Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans for seven years.

Sole Source Justification: The Government knows of only one source, YSI, Inc., who has an OMS that will meet the required salient characteristics. Market research is the following: Although there are other sources that can provide an OMS, the use of any other vendor or manufacturer product would necessitate extensive testing and evaluations that would cause the Government to incur delays and costs that could not be recovered through competition. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps on August 11, 2010 for a 7-day posting and no responses were received.

Improving fishing selectivity and simultaneously reducing capture of non-target species is a high priority for managing global fisheries in order to prevent the depletion of threatened and endangered marine resources. In addressing this priority, we propose to conduct field trials to test the efficacy of various modifications to longline fishing gear in an effort to identify more selective fishing gear that can be adopted in numerous worldwide fisheries.<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><br />NOAA is seeking a contractor to assist in field trials aimed to compare standard fishing gear (the control) with an alternative fishing gear (eg, modified hook or bait) in order to test its effects on capture rates of sea turtles, sharks, and/or target species in longline or fixed net fishing gear. This contract requires that the work be completed in a longline fishery, preferably in the Pacific Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea, where incidence of sea turtle and shark captures is exceptionally high.<br /></span><strong><br />Specific tasks to be completed by the contractor:&nbsp; <br /></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The contractor will oversee sea trials of fishing gear with a modification to traditional gear (treatment) in comparison with a control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In longline gear, the hooks will be tested in alternation in an unbiased (systematically staggered and reordered) fashion along a daily longline set at the same general time of day and location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only paired testing will count towards the contracted amount of fishing effort for payment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will observe, record, and conduct a simple summation of catch results that will contrast the catch (entanglement and hooking) of target and non-target species between the equal amounts of hook types (treatment and control) tested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will seek to remove fishing gear and release captured turtles, rays and sharks as much as possible within the constraints of the fishery. The recommended equipment for handling and release of sea turtles will be provided by NOAA. The contractor will observe, record, and report the rate of entanglement and hook ingestion, or more superficial internal or external hooking of each turtle or shark, as well the anatomical location of gear-inflicted injury, and the animal's condition upon release.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><strong>Deliverables:</strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> <br /></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">A progress report with catch information obtained during at-sea trials (fishing effort observed and recorded) will be provided by the contractor at the time of the second invoice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A draft final report summarizing all experimental results and providing the complete data set should be provided to NOAA for review one month before the final invoice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any requests for revision of the final report will be returned to the contractor within two weeks of receipt of the draft final report. All raw data from field trials.<br /></span><br />Period of performance is from SEPTEMBER 2010 through DECEMBER 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541690 with a size standard of $7.0 million.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE. The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Strategic Acquisition Service (SAS), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the American Board of Medical Specialties Maintenance of Certification (ABMS MOC), 222 N La Salle Street, Suite 1500, Chicago, IL 60601, to work with Member Boards to explore how best to advance the knowledge and skills required to use health IT to improve outcomes. The ABMS shall assist the ONC by working with the Member Boards to work towards setting new expectations regarding the use of health IT to improve clinical care. The ABMS shall explore how best to advance the knowledge and skills required to use health IT to improve outcomes via the MOC programs and develop two knowledge self-assessment modules for Part 2 MOC (knowledge and data management, use of health IT to promote patient safety) and enhance/expand web-based practice improvement modules (PIMs) for Part 4 MOC that incorporate measures that demonstrate Meaningful Use of health IT. In addition, ABMS&nbsp;shall augment Part 2 data management and health IT assessments with a simulation process that shall simulate the development and use of a registry in conducting quality improvement activities that can be used across all specialties. The ABMS shall also retrofit existing web-based tools and build in to future MOC offerings, links to the health information technology resources created and offered by regional extension centers and health information exchange programs.<br /><br />ABMS is a non-profit physician-led umbrella organization for 24 of the 26 approved medical specialty boards in the United States and is the largest voluntary-based physician specialty certification organizations with over 75,000 US physicians having achieved certification by one or more of its 24 medical specialty boards (member boards). ABMS' 24 Member Boards and their understanding of the MOC and meaningful use of health IT and how it appropriately tracks and links with the MOC. The health care IT information in the ABMS is privy to serve as the basis for practice-based learning and how best to advance the knowledge and skills required to use health IT to improve outcomes via the MOC programs. The ABMS' unique expertise and authority over the Member Boards along with the provisions in the Affordable Health Care Act for America of March 23, 2010 makes ABMS uniquely qualified to perform the work required.&nbsp;
<p>The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.
