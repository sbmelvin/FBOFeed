<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue an order with Promega Corp., Madison, WI 53711, as it has been determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This request is to purchase one (1) each of the following: GM3000 GloMax &reg; Discover System - fully loaded and TS2680 GloMax &reg; Multi+ Preventative Maintenance. The following are required capabilities of the system: Allows for up to three detection modalities including BRET, FRET, filtered luminescence, fluorescence, visible absorbance or UV visible absorbance; Multiplex assays with automated filter switching; Reads 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 384-well plate formats; Luminescence dynamic range of &gt;8 logs without the use of filters or gain changes with superior sensitivity with detection of 3 x 10-21 moles of luciferase using Luciferase Assay Reagent; Luminescence Module: An advanced head-on photon-counting photomultiplier tube (PMT) provides unmatched signal-to-noise ratios, beating most standalone luminometers. The luminescence module can detect as little as 3 &times; 10-21 moles of luciferase, covering a dynamic range over 8 logs. A dual-masking system minimizes well-to-well cross-talk. Five filters included for BRET and filtered luminescence assays such as NanoBRET<sup>TM</sup>, Renilla/YFP BRET and Chroma-Glo<sup>TM</sup>; Fluorescence Module: Application-optimized Optical Kits simplify fluorescence operation while maximizing performance. Long-lived LED-based excitation lights minimize maintenance and variability in intensity. LED usage increases sensitivity by fully exciting the fluorophore and reducing nonspecific light leakage, a problem often found when using broad-spectrum light sources. The UV, Blue, Green, Red and AFC Optical Kits are included with the Fluorescence Detection Module; Visible Absorbance Module: A 6-position filter wheel with 2 open positions ensures flexibility for a wide range of applications. An LED-based visible spectrum light source minimizes maintenance and variability. The Visible Absorbance Module has a reading range of 0-5.0 OD with an accuracy that deviates less than 2%. This module comes with filters for reading 450, 560, 600 and 750nm; UV-Visible Absorbance Module: This module comes with a 6-position filter wheel that includes filters for measuring 260, 280, 450, 560, 600 and 750nm. These filters accommodate UV DNA and protein quantitation in addition to ELISA and protein assays. Like the Visible Absorbance Module, you can customize the UV-Visible Absorbance Module by substituting a filter of your choice into either of two removable filter paddles; The GloMax Discover System instrument is operated by an integrated Tablet PC, which provides quick and easy navigation through the control options. Exporting your results is made seamless with a variety of options, including exporting to your local data network; The system instrument can be used as a standalone instrument or integrate into your high-throughput automated workflow; export data to your laboratory network; enable part 11 compliance (user authentication and authorization, data integrity and protection, electronic signatures and audit trails) when used with the appropriate laboratory workflow; The system instrument has a touch screen interface with an easy-to-use software program; The software will provide many of the required technical elements of a part 11 compliant system (user authentication and authorization, data integrity and protection, electronic signatures and audit trails) when used with the appropriate laboratory workflow; and the protocol composer allows complex protocols to be easily developed by combining multiple technologies into one experiment. Award is subject to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Promega Corp. The NAICS Code/Size is 334516/500 Employees. This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Deitra Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
