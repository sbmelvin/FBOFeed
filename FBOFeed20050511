<ARCHDATE>05112006
<CONTACT>Sharon Doerk Contracting Officer 7037871210     Sharon.Doerk@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.   The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm. BACKGROUND:  Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations.  New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2006 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $600,000 to $900,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2006 with projects being identified through this announcement. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may be up to one year of effort and cost up to $250,000. NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared. OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2006 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following:    I. DRILLING:  1. Review completion methodologies used to prevent casing collapse due to thermal loading in sealed annuli in subsea or hybrid deepwater wells. Focus the review on the most current and best practice and provide a risk assessment of each best practice. Such as: -	Using casing rupture disk;  -	Not bringing cement into the casing shoe; and -	Thermal inhibiting of completion fluids and gases.  2. Assess the design options and provide a risk analysis for risers of all types (drilling, production and pipelines) in sour (H2S) service. 3.  Provide guidelines and a risk analysis of using surface BOP systems on floating deepwater facilities.  4. Provide a risk analysis of underbalanced drilling/ managed pressure drilling/ riserless pump drilling operations and systems.  II. WORKOVER:  1. Provide best practices guideline and assess well completion options and methodologies for high pressure/ high temperature/ and sour (H2S) wells.  2. Assess the acceptability and the safety of using equipment, particularly BOP and wellhead components, at pressures in excess of the rated working pressure.  This should include pressure exposure during routine field testing of equipment and short term (less than one year) usage in production.  III. PRODUCTION: 1.  Assess platform production equipment options and methodologies for high pressure, high temperature, and sour (H2S) wells.   Also, access the issue of completing a high pressure / high temperature well on an existing platform with older equipment.  IV. DECOMMISSIONING: 1. Measure the effect of depth below the mudline for explosive charges. V. PIPELINES: 1. Develop guidelines for the internal inspection of both piggable and unpiggable pipelines. 2. Develop operational guidelines for high temperature/ high pressure deepwater pipelines, risers, jumpers, and related facilities. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:     The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices for offshore operations.  As a result of the White Papers, proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues.  HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format, on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior,     Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Sharon Doerk, not later than July 6, 2005 at 04:00 PM, EDT.

No other type of supply or service will satisfy this agency requirement. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals, however interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement for the Government’s consideration.  If no response is received by 19 May 2005, 04:00 PM MDT, to the effect that comparable support services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies or services, through a sole source procurement with Vecna Technologies, a sole source award will be made.

Existing forecasting models developed by DMDC require accurate population estimates for both historical and future years for various demographic groups. The enrollment population data will augment general population statistics in the Recruit Market Information System (RMIS) and provide additional information for recruiters and Service liaisons at Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM). BACKGROUND DMDC has been receiving Quality Education Data (QED) with its principal place of business at 1625 Broadway, Ste 250 Denver, Colorado 80202 since 1997 to assist the Services Recruiting market research and forecast modeling that requires accurate enrollment data. The results of these forecasts are used by DMDC and the Services to set region and district goals, and are critical for effective operation and planning. Recruiters require customized population data for schools, location, grades and racial-ethnic groups since the recruitable market is unique. Enrollment estimates fuel several critical modeling applications: Standard Territory Evaluation and Analysis for Management, enlisted goaling model, enlisted market analysis, diversity trend analysis, enrollment trend analysis and budget analysis.  The Government’s current need outlined in this Statement of Work is significantly different than the Government’s previous need for this data.

<DESC>The Contracts Department of Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego (FISCSD) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements”, with KDH Defense Systems, Inc., 239 Main Street, Suite 240, Johnstown, PA 15901. FISCSD intends to award a firm fixed price type contract for 300 desert outer carriers (Part Number KLAV1000-1D and KLAV1000-2D), 300 ballistic packs (Part Number: KLAV1001-1D and KLAV1001-2D) and 600 ceramic plates (Part Number: KGAMM). These body armor vests manufactured by KDH have been determined to be the only vests capable of meeting the functionality and specific mission requirements, including wear-ability, flexibility, a quick-release mechanism so that the armor can be jettisoned from the wearer to reduce the potential for drowning, and certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats and 7.62mm x 39mm API!  threats. KDH vests have the following characteristics which fulfill these requirement: Quick-Release Mechanism utilizes a single wire for simplicity in activation; Quick-Release Mechanism single wire allows for efficient reassembly; Quick-Release Mechanism can be re-assembled within 75 seconds or less; Quick-Release Mechanism is also utilized for fit adjustment; all moving parts of the Quick-Release are centrally located in the front panel; Quick-Release Mechanism has no exposed parts with the exception of the handle; and upon release of the Quick-Release the vest disassembles into two sections. The hard armor ceramic plates offered by this vendor provide certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats, military threats as specified for the Interceptor SAPI plates, and also the 7.62mm x 39mm API threats recently experienced in the combat theater. No other supplier provides this same protection in their ceramic plates. Ceramic plates are required for their reduced!  weight, which is also a requirement as a result of the specific mission environment. The vendor is also capable of meeting an accelerated delivery schedule to support mission requirements. See Note 22.  This action is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures for commercial items/services under FAR Part 12. This is not a request for quote or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Point of contact is Brian O’Donnell, Contracting Officer, Phone: 619-532-3445, Email: brian.odonnell@navy.mil. All questions must be submitted in writing via email to brian.odonnell@navy.mil no later than 1200 hours on 17 May 2005.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for the upgrade of the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) long range radars (AN/FPS-117) located throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  All seventeen (17) radars will be modernized to provide improved supportability, ease of maintenance and better performance.  Obsolete equipment will be replaced as part of the upgrade program.  The FPS-117(V)3 L-band air surveillance radar is designed to provide real-time 3D data on all targets within the surveillance area.  The primary radar uses an antenna array with electronically scanning elevation beam and mechanical rotation in azimuth.  Also, the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) equipment will be replaced with modern Monopulse SSR (MSSR) equipment.  The new equipment will retain Mode-4 capability and will allow Mode-S upgrade at a later date.  A System Requirements Document (SRD) that is intended to provide the performance requirements of the radar will be provided to the contractors as part of the Final Request for Proposal (RFP).  The contractor will provide all necessary engineering services to fabricate, install and deliver to the RSAF an upgrade to the radars that satisfy the SRD requirements and to train RSAF personnel in operation and maintenance of the equipment.  The contractor will provide all necessary tools, spare parts, test equipment and materials to allow RSAF to run full operation and maintenance of all seventeen radars including radar characteristics monitoring.  The contractor will maximize the use of state-of-the-art, Non-Developmental Items (NDI) hardware for the prime mission equipment, while providing highly reliable and easily maintainable radar that meets all applicable SRD requirements.  The radar equipment will be fully integrated into the existing RSAF C4I System (Peace Shield), and the radar performance will be verified in accordance with the test methods specified in the SRD.  The hardware and software design shall be open architecture to allow replacement of any obsolete hardware, without the redesign of the software or hardware not affected by the change.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to extend their current contract with Harris Corporation, Harris Technical Service Corporation, for the continued support of the Ground Systems Engineering and Depot Support contract, until a new contract is awarded.  This interim extension will provide the continuation of services and support now provided to NOAA and the Department of Defense (DOD) by the contractor. The extension is planned for nine months at $3M.  The contract entails, in part, system engineering and maintenance, most recently upgrades to obsolete legacy equipment, ground support, hardware support and software support, including component supply, repair, testing, maintenance, upgrades, and other technical support of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Windsat-Coriolis satellite.  The DMSP satellites collect and disseminate global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit.  The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.  The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment is less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions does not exceed 3 hours.  SERVICES INFORMATION  Required services include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP requires supply storage at the Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor furnishes all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program requires on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications are required.  Modifications include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland, MD.  Interaction with Government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system is required.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  Interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Previous notice posted a  date of 5 Jun 06 but had a 22 Jun 05 date in the body of the notice.  Again the  correct response date is 6 Jun 05. ******************************************************************************* Correction to Response date. (Posted: 5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Change response date from "22 Jun 05" to "6 Jun 05" ******************************************************************************* Original Source Sought. (Posted:  5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Synopsis The Trainer Aircraft Systems Group (TASG), Joint Primary Aircraft Training  System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting a market survey  of potential sources to provide both T-6A aircraft Sustaining Engineering  support and follow-on Production of T-6A aircraft and related aircrew training  devices (ATDs).  The TASG anticipates awarding a single contract for Sustaining  Engineering support and follow-on Production Lots 14-20.   Background The JPATS is comprised of T-6A aircraft, T-6A ATDS, a Training Information  Management System (TIMS), and courseware. Under the JPATS program, the T-6A  aircraft is replacing the US Air Force (USAF) T-37B and US Navy (USN) T-34C  trainer aircraft.  As a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the T-6A is a low-  wing, high-performance, pressurized, turboprop trainer aircraft.  It is  designed to take advantage of commercial aviation technology to meet US  Government training system requirements.  Complementing the aircraft are five  types of T-6A ATDs: an Operational Flight Trainer with a wide field-of-view  visual system, an Instrument Flight Trainer with a narrow field-of-view visual  system, a Unit Training Device with no visual system, an Escape System Trainer,  and an Egress Procedures Trainer.  None of these ATDs are motion-based.  The  JPATS will provide entry-level student pilots with the skills necessary to  complete contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation  missions during both day and night conditions.  Training in the JPATS will lead  to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN  advanced pilot training tracks.  Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), the JPATS  prime contractor, began building the first T-6A aircraft for the US Government  in 1996, and has been delivering these aircraft since 2000.  Under subcontract  to RAC, the Flight Safety Services Corporation began building the first T-6A  ATDs in 1998, and has been delivering them since 2000.  The T-6A aircraft and  ATDs completed initial operational testing in 2002.  The USAF achieved its  JPATS initial operational capability in 2002 and the USN followed in 2003. Current Environment Previously-awarded US Government production contracts have procured or provide  options to procure 418 T-6A aircraft and 83 T-6A ATDs.  These JPATS assets will  be deployed to USAF or USN training wings and squadrons at several different  locations.  The T-6A aircraft will be supported by a separate Contractor  Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services contract which is not part  of this market survey. The contemplated follow-on Production contract will  procure at least another 365 T-6A aircraft and 38 T-6A ATDs over the course of  seven years, US Government fiscal years 2007-2013.  For seamless training  operations, the additional T-6A aircraft and ATDs must be identical to those  already produced.  In addition, the TASG needs to make several Class I  engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs to remedy user-identified  deficiencies, mitigate the discovery of obsolete parts, or adjust the  performance of the aircraft and ATDs to match evolving user mission  requirements.  These Class I engineering changes will include changes to  production configuration as well as retrofit of fielded assets.  Therefore, the  TASG intends to procure Sustaining Engineering support as major part of the  follow-on Production contract.  Potential sources are advised that Raytheon  Aerospace Corporation (RAC) still owns design rights to the T-6A aircraft and  peculiar support equipment.  RAC is currently the sole provider of studies,  analysis, and Class I and II engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and  ATDs.  RAC also provides all maintenance support for the US Government’s  prototype aircraft (PT-4), crash damage repairs to fielded aircraft, and  system/sustaining engineering support of the entire JPATS Ground Based Training  System (GBTS): ATDs, TIMS, and courseware.     Contract Requirements 1. 7 lots of T-6A aircraft, at least 365 in total. 2. 7 lots of T-6A ATDs, at least 38 in total 3. Simulator Servers as required,  to integrate the ATDs with the remainder of the GBTS. 4. Future studies and analysis against aircraft and ground-based training  equipment deficiencies and product enhancements. 5. Maintenance support for the prototype (PT-4) aircraft located at RAC in  Wichita, KS. 6. Support for the development of new product enhancements for JPATS. 7. Crash damage repair as required for any fielded aircraft. 8. Onsite field service representatives at main operating bases to assist in  maintenance support. 9. Navy aircraft spares outside the typical COMBS Services contract  requirements. 10. Engine Structural Integrity Program and Aircraft Structural Integrity  Program support. 11. GBTS integration + systems engineering support. 12. Dedicated engineering support to address deficiency reports,  and  miscellaneous program management planning. 13. Incidental aircraft pilot training, GBTS user training, aircraft  maintenance training, and FIREFAM training. 14. Engineering changes to be cut-in to production aircraft and ATDs. 15. Retrofit of hardware or software changes on fielded assets. 16. Parts obsolescence management. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to  determine the availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms  responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business,  HUBZone small business, and/or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.   The North American Industrial Classification System Code 336411, Aircraft  Manufacturing, applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,500  employees.  All potential sources must be registered in the Central Contractor  Registration database to be awarded a DoD contract.  Interested firms are  encouraged to first register as a potential source on the PIXS Web Site  (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  PLEASE INFORM US IF YOUR FIRM INTENDS TO  PERFORM THE WORK SOLELY OR IF YOU DESIRE TO SUBCONTRACT WITH THE PRIME  CONTRACTOR. Technical Considerations In addition to the information requested above, interested firms should also  submit sufficient information to permit evaluation and qualification of their  technical capabilities.  The TASG will be assessing the level of market  interest and competitiveness for this acquisition based on responses to the following: 1. Does your firm have knowledge of the entire T-6A aircraft?

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This is also a notice of intent that the Government intends to negotiate a sole-source order to Quality Education Data of Jefferson City, MO under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the requirement is 541910 and the size standard is $6.0 million.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
School Enrollment Data

OBJECTIVE

To provide Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) enrollment data that is essential for accurate market analysis of the relevant recruitable population markets for Recruit Market Information Systems (RMIS) Web site at DMDC, Navy to develop the last ‘High School Attended File’ for access initially by the Navy Recruiter and ultimately by all Services and for Army and DHRA to use for segmentation analysis. Existing forecasting models developed by DMDC require accurate population estimates for both historical and future years for various demographic groups. The enrollment population data will augment general population statistics in the Recruit Market Information System (RMIS) and provide additional information for recruiters and Service liaisons at Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM).

BACKGROUND

DMDC has been receiving Quality Education Data (QED) with its principal place of business at 1625 Broadway, Ste 250 Denver, Colorado 80202 since 1997 to assist the Services Recruiting market research and forecast modeling that requires accurate enrollment data. The results of these forecasts are used by DMDC and the Services to set region and district goals, and are critical for effective operation and planning. Recruiters require customized population data for schools, location, grades and racial-ethnic groups since the recruitable market is unique. Enrollment estimates fuel several critical modeling applications: Standard Territory Evaluation and Analysis for Management, enlisted goaling model, enlisted market analysis, diversity trend analysis, enrollment trend analysis and budget analysis. 
The Government’s current need outlined in this Statement of Work is significantly different than the Government’s previous need for this data.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH has a requirement to establish three to four Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units for evaluation of SIV and HIV vaccine approaches in support of preclinical AIDS vaccine research and development.  For this project, the Division of AIDS, NIAID, is seeking organizations with the technical expertise and facilities needed to house 100 – 300 nonhuman primates in BSL2 and BSL2/3 containment facilities and to conduct preclinical evaluations of the immunogenicity and efficacy of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV candidate vaccines in the nonhuman primates.  Studies are conducted at the initiation of the NIAID, and vaccines to be evaluated are selected by NIAID.  The Contractor will provide the nonhuman primates and the scientific and technical expertise necessary to conduct preliminary studies on new vaccines, conduct larger-scale studies on vaccines that have already demonstrated promise, evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of candidate HIV vaccines in anticipation of Phase II human clinical trials, and conduct comparative studies on vaccines and/or adjuvants from multiple sources.  The SVEUs may also conduct studies with passively administered vaccines.  The SVEUs are expected to provide non-human primates for the studies, immunize animals with candidate vaccines, conduct initial assessments of immune responses, challenge the non-human primates with infectious virus, and determine whether or not the animals become infected.  The SVEUs also conduct in vivo titrations of virus challenge stocks and may conduct microbicide studies to evaluate the ability of topically administered microbicides and other antiviral substances to block infection of non-human primates with virus administered vaginally or by other mucosal routes.  The proposed contracts will continue the work of the current SVEUs.  It is anticipated that three to four (3-4) completion type contracts will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  This project will take approximately seven years to complete.  It is anticipated that three to four cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, each with a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately May 8, 2006.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-06-15 will be available electronically on or about May 6, 2005 with a closing date tentatively set for August 8, 2005, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract -- and will also be posted on FedBizOps.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) at Panama City, Fl, is requesting information from industry for approaches in developing the concept in this Request For Information (RFI). The U.S. Navy is in the process of determining the future of Unmanned Vehicle communications. This effort is being lead by the Joint Unmanned Systems Common Control (JUSC2) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) at NSWC Panama City and supported by SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts (DUSD – AS&C) sponsors the JUSC2 ACTD.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center – Panama City (NSWC-PC) is the technical manager, PEO Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS-420, is the transition manger, and the U.S. Joint Forces Command is the operational manager. The JUSC2 ACTD has been tasked with developing a system for controlling multiple unmanned vehicles. The main thrust of this work includes designing and implementing a command and control system that can accept vehicle status and sensor information from a wide array of unmanned vehicles and present the information in a coherent and useful manner to operators.  One issue identified in this concept of common vehicle control is a communications system that will allow multiple unmanned vehicles to operate without interference in a common operating area.  Some of the key requirements for the communications system include: mobile ad-hoc connectivity, effective quality of service provisions, support for user data in IPv4 and/or IPv6 datagrams, a system for network status and control, and extended range support through relays.  To that end, the ACTD is working on an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) paper for an unmanned vehicle communications system that will support multiple dissimilar unmanned vehicles. The concepts outlined in the AoA are to be investigated further for application to real world capabilities of current communications systems.   This RFI is the beginning of an effort to evaluate the capability of current commercially available technology to support the ACTD demonstration. The ACTD will demonstrate a Line-of-Sight (LOS) networked communication system that is capable of supporting up to twelve unmanned surface, subsurface, and air vehicles. Not only must the basic RF connectivity be demonstrated, there will be an actively changing, mobile ad-hoc network with variable data rates, latencies, and numbers of active nodes. This is a sources sought announcement only and is not a solicitation or Broad Agency Announcement.  A solicitation will not be issued as a result of this announcement.  If a solicitation is developed after consideration of all information received, it will be advertised in the Government Point of Entry (GPE).  Responses to this announcement should be sent to the address stated below not later than 30 days after posting.  Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Code XPS1, Attn: Mark Ross, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL. 32407-7001.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Joseph Krajn! ak at (850) 235-5293 or email joseph.krajnak@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information for the purposes of conducting market research.  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plans to issue one or more solicitation(s) to create an enterprise wide system that traverses on the existing and future TSA network infrastructure designed to communicate security equipment text and data between various TSA sites, at both local and national level.  This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information.  There is no solicitation available at this time, TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that can meet the following concept. The concept that is being investigated will be to develop a gateway between all existing and future airport security equipment across 450 airports nationwide and a centralized data collection/distribution management center. The goal will to be to provide TSA with a dynamic and completely configurable system that supports near real time information about existing and future deployed airport security equipment. The types of airport security equipment being considered as part of this RFI includes Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-rays, Explosive Trace Detectors, Explosive Detection Systems, and Walk Through Metal Detectors.  The concept will provide for administrative and technical communications such as remote maintenance monitoring (RMM), property management, configuration management, resource management and collection/distribution of equipment and screener performance information. Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain (1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, (2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a turn key solution that meets the above concept, and (3) suggestions on alternative approaches to minimize total life cycle cost.  

Background:  TSA is responsible for “protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.”  The proposed concept is an initiative being investigated by TSA that incorporates enterprise management of assets, training efficiencies, data collection, trend analysis and remote maintenance monitoring from a local and national level as a business process improvement solution.  

There are over 12,000 pieces of airport security equipment installed nationwide including Explosive Detection Systems TIP Ready X-ray, Explosive Trace Detectors and Electronic Metal Detectors. These machines contain performance information that is collected through manually intensive processes. Thus, TSA is seeking an automated cost-effective solution to transmit specific data from the airport security equipment located within an airport to centralized data management center.  The concept that is being investigated includes the following properties: 
• Provide near-real time remote maintenance monitoring of security assets.  The RMM will support an improved maintenance strategy and concept. 
• Provide near-real time monitoring of screener and equipment performance;
• Provide security equipment inventory management and movement tracking;
• Provide a COTS solution that adheres to Industry standards including open systems architecture. 
1. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicle PM LTV Office Warren, MI is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due 30 May 05.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This market  survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren.  Request for Technical Solutions for a Lightweight armored replacement door for HMMWVs.  The PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support and t he PM Tactical Vehicles are looking for feasible materiel solutions to help protect soldiers during combat operations.  The major issues with the current system are: Doors are heavy; window style is cumbersome (swing out vice slider or other style); latche s are failing; hinges not holding up; doors allow fragments to get through; use of side mirrors are inhibited by armor.  Intent: It is the intent of TACOM on behalf of the Army to obtain and test a lighter weight armored door for the HMMWVs.  The current a dd-on armored door weighs 202 pounds front, 205 pounds rear each (including window glass, gasket, door handle and hinge).  Replacement armored doors must be same fit and form, provide a reduction in weight and provide equivalent threshold or improved fragm ent and rifle ball ammo protection (desired) compared to current doors.  Current doors are fabricated from 3/8 Mil-A 12560 (Class 1).  The doors must be capable of fitting into a standard HMMWV door frame.  Variations beyond that are allowable (armor overl aps, improved hinges, different window design, etc).  Doors must be able to be installed by organization units with no special tools.  The replacement armored doors shall not exhibit severe cracking or displacement when subjected to the fragmentation spray  of an IED.  Armor shall provide multi-hit protection equivalent to the current doors.  The replacement doors must come with latches that do not jam when exposed to IED events or automotive accidents or under normal usage conditions.  These new latches mus t be an improvement in current durability.  Transparent armor shall provide equal or better protection than the current 3.5 inch thick (44 pound) door window.  The window area shall be not less than the current design.  Windows do not need to be form/fit w ith the current windows.  Transparent armor shall be compatible with night vision devices.  The doors with windows shall allow improved use of the side mirrors.  Currently side mirrors are obscured by the side windows.  All protection shall be effective th roughout the full vehicle operational temperature range (negative 50 to positive 120 Degrees Fahrenheit).  You must provide testing data to support claims of protective performance.  You must provide one sample door prototypes for test purposes.  Two door samples are desired.  You must call in to Scott Doudna at 586-574-8205 to be assigned the particular door (front driver, rear passenger left, front passenger, rear passenger right) that you must provide.  This is being done so that we can test more than on e manufacturers doors on one test vehicle for automotive impacts.

<SUBJECT>F -- MONITORING OF AQUATIC LIFE IN REMOTE STREAMS & RIVERS
<DESC>The Aquatic Monitoring of Aquatic Life in Remote Streams and Rivers Project is for the San Dimas Technology and Development Center located in Los Angeles County, California. The contractor shall monitor the ubiquity and habits of aquatic life throughout National Forest land and play a critical role in protecting the health of this natural resource.  Threatened and endangered species require frequent and accurate surveys at a variety of locations and times to protect and enhance the viability of tenuous populations.  Developments such as culverts and bridges require monitoring both before and after installation to detect adverse habitat impacts.  Budgetary constraints require frugality in both development and monitoring projects.  Current methods of aquatic life monitoring require large manpower investments, equipment expenditures, or both, yet offer only modest data quality.  The Forest Service seeks information concerning new technology that will improve the accuracy of aquatic surveys at reduced labor and equipment cost.
The information the Forest Service seeks regards equipment that could be used to directly detect, measure the size of, and/or differentiate the species of fish and/or other aquatic species, in their natural habitats, without manual input.  There are already several commercially available products that employ various methods for this; however, all have certain critical drawbacks.  See the following section for a discussion of these methods and their relevant drawbacks. NAICS code:  541690   Size Standard $ 6.0 million  The Request for Information is due by noon June 13, 2005.  Please check this site for additional information.

<SUBJECT>B -- Notice of intent to negotiate sole source contract
<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center located in Honolulu, Hawaii intends to negotiate a sole source contract with University of Carolina, Department of Biology for the research study entitled “Behavioral Responses of Sea Turtles to Flashing Light Sticks”.  Contractor will test turtles’ behavioral responses to lightsticks of different wavelengths and frequencies to identify potential means to deter them from longline fishing gear.  Contractor will conduct testing on several additional types of flashing sticks in laboratory experiments so that the most promising ones can be selected for field tests in the near future. The experiments will be carried out at the NMFS Galveston Sea Turtle Facility. The research will be conducted by an associate professor of Biology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. He is uniquely qualified for this contract as he possesses the combined experience and skills to perform the research.  For the past fourteen years he has published more than 20 papers on the sensory biology and navigation behavior of sea turtles in first-rate, peer- reviewed scientific journals. He is internationally recognized for his pioneering research on sea turtle sensory abilities and studied responses of turtles to visual cues, earth-strength magnetic fields, and rotational displacement induced by ocean waves and wave currents and successfully developed behavioral experiments which demonstrated for the first time that chemical light sticks used by longline fishermen are attractive to young, pelagic stage loggerheads. A firm-fixed price order will be issued with performance period from June 2005 thru Dec 31, 2006. This notice may represent the only office notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50, 000.00. ****The Western Administrative Support Center Acquisition Management Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise information regarding the space waiver that is in process, to add one option year to this requirement, and to address a question that has been submitted regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

A space waiver is in process to provide approval for up to eight (8) contractor employees to sit in DISA spaces located at Skyline 7 in Falls Church, VA. 

The period of performance is one (1) year from date of award with an additional one (1) year option period. The Government estimate includes the following labor categories and hours for this requirement: Program/Project Manager (120 hours); Program Analyst (Mid-Level) (9,480 hours); Program Analyst (Junior Level) (3,840 hours); Database Developer (Junior Level) (1,920 hours); and Administrative Assistant (Mid-Level) (1,100 hours). A similar level of effort is projected for the one option year added as an amendment to the solicitation. This will be a firm fixed price contract for a base year and one option year. 

Submitted Question: Is it possible for the NAICS to be changed to a NAICS such as 541519 that has a higher SB limit?

Response: DISA has carefully considered the issue of changing the NAICS code for this procurement. Historically, NAICS code 541611 has been used for two prior related efforts for GCCS-J Program Control Management Support Services. This NAICS code was first used in FY2003 and was associated with DAPPR30038. The second use of this NAICS code was in FY2004 and was associated with HC1047-04-R-4037. Considering that this requirement has previously been synopsized with NAICS code 541611, the NAICS code for this procurement will remain as 541611 with a corresponding qualifying size standard of $6 million.

The response date remains unchanged as does the date for submission of any questions. 

Also, as a temporary measure, since this requirement was synopsized the contract specialist has been affected by the incident resulting in building lock downs at Bailey's Crossroad (specifically, 5111 Leesburg Pike). Offeror's questions should be submitted to matchison@earthlink.net until further notice.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020 is to address several questions submitted by potential offerors regarding this requirement.

Question: Is the Government seeking competition for this requirement?
Response: Yes.

Question: Is the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, SAP, and its processes and technology being used to provide the comprehensive business management assistance?
Response: GCCS-J PMO does not use ERP nor does it use SAP. Nowhere in the Performance-Based Work Statement does it state that GCCS-J uses ERP or SAP.

Question: Is the ERP system SAP being used on the GCCS program?
Response: No. Please see previous response above.

Question: How important is it for the HubZone to have recent ACAT 1AM program office support experience?
Response: Paragraph 3 of the Performance-Based Work Statement clearly states: "Direct, recent ACAT 1AM program office support experience is essential to execute this PWS."

Question: Solicitation stated: Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Does this mean this is a Simplified Acquisition Procedure ($100K or less)?
Response: Combined synopsis/solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020 has been prepared and posted in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6. But specifically, this requirement falls under FAR Subpart 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items." This subpart authorizes, as a test program, use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $5 million, including options. This requirement is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold defined at FAR Subpart 2.1 as $100,000.00.

The time and date for submission of any questions as well as the time and date for submission of proposals remains unchanged.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SIMLAB SIMULATION PARTICIPANTS. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Q1: If simulation experiments are not uniform through out the year, how much advance notice will be given to schedule participants for a simulation/training sessions? A1: NASA will, to the best of our ability, provide at least 6-8 weeks advance notice.  However, due to customer requirements, there may be occasions when we will provide as little as 2 weeks. Q2. Will the training for the pseudo pilots count toward the total hours for Air Traffic Controllers and pseudo pilots? A2. Yes. Q3. Will these experiments impact the careers of the participants in any negative way? If so how? A3. NASA does not anticipate any negative impact from participation in simulation experiments. Q4. What do you mean about "Travel will be included in specific delivery orders as needed"? A4. If constraints limiting travel for the sim participants are known in advance, we will say so in the orders.	Otherwise, any travel that is proposed is subject to NASA approval.  Q5. Are military equivalents acceptable in lieu of FAA issued pilot's licenses?  Specifically, will a Form 8 certification in a large, glass-cockpit, FMS-equipped military aircraft be accepted? A5.  For pseudo-pilots, military equivalents would be acceptable.  For flight simulation pilots it depends on each project's requirements. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 2, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet. These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>THE PERIOD FOR QUESTIONS IS CLOSED...
 

 

Here are some additional questions and answers (final):

 

QUESTION #1)  We understand that the RFQ due date is now May 16, 2005.  Given that date when do you anticipate the product demonstrations to NSF users on-site will occur?  We would like to know this for planning purposes.

 

ANSWER:  It is anticipated that the product demonstrations will occur within 30 days after the proposal due date.

 

 

QUESTION #2)  It is our understanding that the Demonstration Script will be provided by the software vendors at the time of the NSF on-site demonstration.  This does not have to be part of the response to the proposal back to NSF.  Is this correct?

 

ANSWER:  This is correct.  NSF will contact the software vendors after award for this information.

 

QUESTION #3)  Since the base for this RFP is just to provide software and training.  Can you describe the training facilities at NSF?  How many seats, are there training pc's, overhead projector etc.  This information is necessary to determine the number of end user training days and if training can be held on site or not.  

 

ANSWER:  NSF has two primary training facilities that each holds 16 seats, not including the trainer's workstation.  It has full software training capabilities, including PCs, overhead projectors, etc.

 

QUESTION #4)  Or is it the intent of NSF to have the System Administrator and/or COTS-PMS Project Manager to perform the end user training?

 

ANSWER:  

 

Training should be hands-on, and include train-the-trainer sessions.
