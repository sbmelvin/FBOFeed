At a minimum, primary source material may be gathered from, but are not limited to, electronic records, negatives, prints and electronic image files, historical and current project files, and other documents pertaining to TAA and its predecessor organizations in databases at the Transatlantic Afghanistan Division (TAD), Middle East District (MED), in Winchester, Va., and the research and oral history collection of the HQUSACE, Office of History (CEHO), Alexandria, Va. Individual employees will be officially encouraged to share documents pertaining to TAA and its predecessor organizations with the Contractor. Other primary source materials may include congressional hearings and reports; Government Accountability Office reports; federal, state and local legislation; and where possible, materials that may be in the personal possession of current and former personnel. Secondary materials may include, but are not limited to, publications such as "Moving Forward: The First Five Years of the Afghanistan Engineer District," CEHO, 1 March 2009, monograph; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: A History, (Alexandria, Virginia: HQUSACE, Office of History, 2008), articles in professional journals, magazines, newspapers, and other commercial publications. All published material will be unclassified; it must either already be in the public domain or available through a Freedom of Information Act request. Contractor will have access to classified and unclassified systems as required and approved by the local security administrator.<br />a. The Contractor shall also conduct oral history interviews with current and former TAA personnel or other persons closely associated with TAA and its mission. The contractor will place particular emphasis on interviewing former commanders of TAA and its predecessor organizations who have not been interviewed previously. Each interview will last approximately one to two hours. The majority of the interviews will be recorded using high quality digital recording equipment and transcribed at the Contractor's expense using a format provided by the CEHO. The names of interviewees shall be provided to the Contractor by the TAA Public Affairs Officer. Interviews may be conducted by telephone, or if necessary, by the Contractor traveling to the desired location in the United States at government expense. Interviews taking place within two hours' drive of USACE Headquarters in Washington, D.C., or of Winchester, Va., will be conducted in person at no additional cost to the government. Four in person interviews will be recorded with broadcast quality video recording equipment in MP4 format shot at a 720p minimum. The contractor will provide the video equipment and camera crew. The raw video interviews will be turned over to TAA public affairs for later use in other projects. <br />b. The Contractor will be responsible for gathering the visual elements that will illustrate the history update. While the focus of the book will be narrative history, the manuscript will also be heavily illustrated. The Contractor will be responsible for collecting and, if necessary, digitizing at least 300 color photographs, illustrations, graphics, and maps to reflect, in a modern and engaging way, the historic and current operations of the TAA and its predecessor organizations, its area of operation, and its employees and contractors at work. Work will include collecting, scanning and cataloguing photographs; and incorporating maps, charts and tables provided to the contractor. Hard copy images will be scanned as 600 pixels per inch (ppi) TIFF files and provided to the government electronically. The Contractor will provide born-digital images at a minimum resolution of 300 ppi at 5x7 inches, resulting in a minimum file size of approximately 1.6 megabytes. The Contractor will also write the appropriate captions and credits for all of the images provided and will secure releases, where necessary, for those images. The Contractor will catalogue all photos, captions, credits, and release information in a table, based on a template provided by CEHO, to be submitted with the images to the government.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor will be responsible for collecting the information necessary to produce a series of maps to establish the TAA's and its predecessor organization's initial area of responsibility and major changes in its area of operation over time; define the parameters of the district's military construction and reconstruction workloads; and explain how the district was organized (including the location of important programs, projects, and area and resident offices). The contractor will provide such information on maps, annotated with relevant details, to the government which will produce new maps based on the Contractor's submissions.</p>
<p>d. It is the government's intent that the format of the history of the USACE in Afghanistan will approximate the composition of The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: A History (Alexandria, Virginia: HQUSACE, Office of History, 2008). While the government will be responsible for the layout and design of the final product in four color format, the contractor is responsible for preparing text (both the primary text and short text boxes related to notable people, subjects, or events); and collecting sufficient images and maps to support that format. As the subject matter expert, the Contractor is also required to participate in the layout and design process.</p>
<p>e. The Contractor will be responsible for all local travel in conjunction with research and interviews conducted during the preparation of this history. The contractor will work closely with TAD and MED personnel in Winchester, Va., and will be required to work at their facilities for several weeks.
