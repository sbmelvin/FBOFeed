In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Government New/Unused or Commercial New/Unused Surplus may be considered.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />HSBP1012R0018<br />Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation <br />Synopsis:
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) as well as a DRAFT Request for Proposal. This pre-solicitation notice includes a DRAFT solicitation (see attachments). Any questions about the DRAFT RFP shall be submitted in writing by Friday, January 6, 2012 at 3:30PM Eastern Time to Jason.W.Bailey@dhs.gov. Telephonic questions will not be entertained.</p>
<p>Under the authority of Title I, Sec. 101 Homeland Security Act of 2002 as amended, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States. Aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art multi-mode sensors are an effective means of detecting, sorting and tracking border incursions. Customs and Border Protection <br />Customs and Border Protection (CBP) currently operates a fleet of manned and unmanned aircraft, including manned P-3 and DHC-8 patrol aircraft and the Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). Each of these platforms has an electro-optical imaging sensor, but only the Predator B UAS has the capability to transmit the sensor video to the CBP ground facilities for exploitation.</p>
<p>Digital backhaul capability from manned aircraft has already been demonstrated using three (3) CBP P-3 aircraft equipped with INMARSAT Datalink systems, but this implementation has proven to be very expensive to operate and provide inadequate bandwidth to effectively downlink video. The primary purpose of this Ku Band Beyond Line of Sight Digital Datalink (BLOSDD) System, with its higher bandwidth capabilities, shall be to demonstrate the real-time transmission of data and imagery from onboard sensors on the P-3 and DHC-8 to an appropriate ground station while exploiting existing surplus CBP Office of Air and Marine (OAM) Ku-band capacity already on contract to support UAS operations.</p>
<p>This DRAFT RFP is posted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 for the purpose of acquiring a Ku Band Beyond Line of Sight Digital Datalink (BLOSDD) System. The purpose of the Ku Band BLOSDD System effort is to design, develop, install, and test software and a hardware system that will provide a Ku Bandwidth, satellite-based, datalink capability for P-3 Long Range Tracker (LRTs), P-3 Airborne Early Warning (AEW), and DHC-8 (200 and 300 series) aircraft as well as the necessary ground-based operation centers. The Ku Band BLOSDD System will assist CBP mission operators to rapidly and efficiently deliver and receive point-to-point and general broadcast data sets, thereby enabling all operators in the field and decision makers in operations centers to have "near real-time" access to audio-visual information required to effectively perform the mission of protecting the homeland.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this procurement is: 334511.<br />The anticipated official solicitation issuance date is unknown. DHS makes no representation that a final solicitation will be issued or that a contract award will result from the solicitation (when issued).</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure depot level manufacture, repair and refurbishment of Aviation Armament Equipment (AAE), specifically the P-3C Wing Station and Weapons Bay Pylons for the Taiwan Navy (TN) and United States Navy (USN). This effort will provide for the depot level overhaul, repair refurbishment and Digital Stores Management System (DSMS) upgrade of Wing Station (WS) and Weapons Bay (WB) Pylons and the acquisition of wing spacers, BRU-15/A and BRU 12/A bomb racks and associated hardware necessary to configure up to 12 Taiwan P-3C aircraft plus spares. The USN requirement is for the upgrade and repair of Maverick Wing Pylon Assemblies currently in a Non-Ready for Issue (RFI) status. The P-3C DSMS is designed to replace existing armament system Kill Stores, Torpedo, Harpoon Aircraft Command Launch Control System (HACLCS) and Kill Stores System while providing growth capability to control MIL-STD-1760D Class II stores at 12 weapon stations (6 Wing Station, 6 Weapons Bay Stations). DSMS will provide the same weapon capability as currently provided in the legacy P-3C armament system with the exception of specific weapon capabilities not releasable to FMS operators. The US Navy did not incorporate the DSMS functionality into the P-3C AIP aircraft. The pylons do not have the MIL-STD-1760D capability and remain in the original Maverick configuration.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(PN 76767) in FY 2012. <br><br>PLA Definition: is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br><br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br><br>(2) Be consistent with law.<br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>(a) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>(b)  Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>(c) Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>(d) Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>(e) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br><br>(f) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br><br>(g)  Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>(h) Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?<br><br>(i) Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?<br><br>Please provide your comments via e-mail to: ladell.p.barnes@usace.army.mil; title email: "Project Labor Agreement for ORTC at Ft Hood, Texas (PN  65374)", no later than January 5, 2012, 2:00pm CST.<br><br><br>

 The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The Government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the LROI project
2.0	BACKGROUND
The purpose of the long range ocular interrupter (LROI) is to provide the Navy the capability to deliver a bright beam of light that produces a dazzling or glare effect on a closing target to warn and/or suppress potential threats through increasing levels of visual degradation.  The LROI will provide a controlled, high-intensity light beam at two levels.  A lower level will facilitate visual warning, and a second, higher level will provide temporary visual suppression.
  The LROI will deliver the correct irradiance to affect a targeted individuals vision, providing a clear, unambiguous warning at a distance of 3,000 meters (approximately 3,300 yards, or 1.6 nautical miles), an increased range over previous systems.  At a minimum, this extended range capability will provide increased tactical decision-making time to facilitate structured escalation of force (EoF) tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) across a broad range of military operations (ROMO).  Further, the LROI system enhances Joint Force operations in assessing the intent of personnel and controlling a potential threat as early as possible.
3.0	PURPOSE
The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 4.
 Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in information defined in paragraph 4 and the attachments.
4.0	CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT
Currently LROI is in a pre-Milestone A acquisition phase.  Although individual underlying technologies associated with LROI are considered mature, the integration and control of each into a cohesive non-lethal capability is new.  As such, NSWCDD is canvassing industry to assist in identification of readily available commercial based solutions that have proven field trials and/or prototype testing focused in the areas of magnifying optics detection, environmental adaptation, and automated variable power attenuation.  In support of the technology development, the Government plans on working with industry in a collaborative basis to explore technology advancements and alternatives to aid in accelerating maturation of system and subsystem capabilities needed to satisfy LROI design attributes and operational requirements.
 
The goal of this collaborative strategy and the information collected through this RFI is to assess commercial investment and the maturity of enabling technologies/capabilities in support of LROI development.  Currently, an LROI-type system is being scoped to meet expeditionary mission requirements.  The following outlines the scope of information sought and maturity of commercial-based solutions presented by the vendor.
Technology Focus Areas:
Focused technology development efforts will take into consideration suitable commercially-available technological approaches and solutions to further maturate the following areas being considered as LROI system functions.  Based on current market analysis and preliminary technical readiness evaluation, the following four (4) focus areas have been identified for this RFI.
  LROI functional characteristics, performance and capability attributes are provided in Attachment 1.  This attachment will enable the vendor to provide information that is relevant to the request.
1.	Magnifying Optics Detection
Currently, LROI is assessing the functionality to provide eye-safe operation, and to limit any permanent injury to operators, targeted individuals, or incidental non-combatants. One system attribute that requires definition for any non-lethal weapon is the acceptable risk of significant injury (RSI) to the contact or target of interest (COI/TOI).  The most significant source of injury comes from the possibility of eye damage due to an individuals use of magnifying direct view optics (such as a rifle scope, spotting scope, or binoculars) within the LROI systems beam.
  In such a case, the beam would become highly focused through the optics, potentially causing permanent eye damage to the COI/TOI. The vendor information provided would assist in defining a realistic RSI parameter and approaches to adapt or include a system capability to detect magnifying optical devices within the projected beam.
2.	Environmental Adaptation
Most non-lethal weapons have been fielded only for short-range applications.  LROI, as a long-range capability, requires additional levels of beam control to guarantee the intended effects of warning and suppression on the COI/TOI.  Irradiance on COI/TOI can be reduced due to environmental conditions such as humidity, airborne particulates, or atmospheric refraction.
 Information about these conditions may be used to dynamically adjust beam irradiance to overcome atmospheric effects.   Current commercially available technologies may be used to measure these conditions; however, these technologies only provide accurate environmental information local to the point of origin (source) and cannot provide acceptable measurements along the path to remote targets (COI/TOIs).  This RFI requests vendor information applicable to this focus area to provide specific means to enable LROI to reliably and effectively deliver the desired non-lethal effects at extended ranges given variable maritime environmental conditions.  In particular, the Government requests information on available technologies that can provide a lateral atmospheric sounding capability to determine attenuation and other beam effects over the distance between the LROI and the COI/TOI.
  
3.	Automated Variable Power Attenuation
In order to ensure safe operations, including avoidance of unintended consequences, beam control must provide the means to adjust irradiance on target in order to achieve the desired effects while ensuring a low risk of significant injury.  Implementation will require a high degree of control to ensure appropriate personnel safety while maintaining performance.  This RFI seeks innovative vendor approaches and capabilities to provide necessary control measures and mechanisms to provide automated sensing, control, and adjustment of the beams irradiance to the COI/TOI within the anticipated range of LROI, and to detect and react to the occurrence of beam interruptions by objects other than the COI/TOI.
4.	Expeditionary Configured Power Sources
Expeditionary power is focused on providing a reliable source of power for LROI that is compatible with the expeditionary warfare operating environment while maintaining environmental and system safety requirements.
  Vendor information provided in response to this RFI should focus on identifying lightweight, small footprint, high power density, and expeditionary environmentally survivable power sources that can be utilized and adapted.
Collaboration in a Laboratory/ Range Environment:
Laboratory testing and range demonstration events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with Government developmental and operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and available solutions may support or present a potential to be adapted to satisfy LROI functional requirements.  This testing environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government and industry to promote the identification of emerging and mature technologies and to assess potential solutions to expeditionary missions and capabilities.
  Industry participation in test and demonstration activities does not suggest or imply that the Government will procure or purchase equipment.
Technology shall be at Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) or greater for the purpose of selection to be invited for laboratory testing or range demonstration.
Assess Industry Manufacturing/Production Capacity and Organic (US) Sourcing:
Vendor information provided to this RFI should cover state-of-the-art manufacturing, assembly, and production methodologies and processes that can be leveraged from the commercial sector to reduce potential non-recurring costs associated with the development of an LROI-type capability.  Vendor responses should provide information on their strategies, methodologies, and established processes associated with prototype, pre-production, and production article designs.
   Of particular interest is vendor collaboration with US sources that supply materials and components either manufactured or developed within the US that can be examined for LROI applications.

<p>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source bases with SNL Financial LC, 195 One SNL Plaza, Charlottesville, VA, 22902 for online access to financial and regulatory filing data for over 21,000 privately and publicly owned banks, thrifts, and credit unions, including more than 5,000 bank holding companies in North America. SNL Financial will also provide online access to over 500 regulatory and financial filing data fields for over 750 financial institutions based mainly in Europe. In addition, SNL Financial will provide online access to financial information for over 4,400 insurance companies and over 600 insurance groups in the U.S. Finally, SNL will provide access to its data to all GAO employees through its website and its Excel "add-in" tool to integrate SNL data into spreadsheets and analytical models.</p>
<p>GAO has determined that the data services provided by SNL Financial are responsive to GAO's analytical and documentation needs for planned financial markets work. SNL Financial delivers financial data through an analytical module within Microsoft Excel, a GAO-approved software available to all staff. Excel users in the agency can easily utilize the data importing features within Excel. In addition, the data output format (1) provides a high level of transparency to facilitate tracing and verifying of the data and (2) eliminates the need for time-consuming manual checks and data file verifications. Further, SNL allows for an unlimited number of GAO users to use the product simultaneously. The data service is not tethered to any single workstation. A justification for other than full and open competition is attached in support of this procurement action.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The period of performance is date of award through December 28, 2012. This is a simplified acquisition action estimated value not to exceed $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 10 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this notice is to be sent to Delores Ennis; <a href="mailto:ennisd@gao.gov">ennisd@gao.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br>Modular Cold Food Counter (MCFC) with Refrigerated Storage and Dessert Display Case<br><br>23 December 2011<br>INTRODUCTION: <br><br>The Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Feeding Directorate (CFD) is planning to conduct a research effort to procure, test and document the next generation Modular Cold Food Counter (MCFC) with Refrigerated storage and dessert display case. The MCFC research effort is planned to be conducted by the DoD Combat Feeding Directorate, Systems Equipment and Engineering Team (SEET).<br>This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes and is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the Natick Solider Research development and Engineering Command (NSRDEC) Combat Feeding Program.  Responses to this RFI are optional.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NSRDEC will take procurement action in this matter. Neither NSRDEC nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.<br><br>GENERAL BACKGROUND: <br><br>The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force is required to feed anywhere from several hundred to several thousand sailors and airmen each day depending on ship or field kitchen size. In order to do that, many different pieces of food service equipment are required. The Navy and Air Force's current food service practices necessitates the use of a cold food serving line, a refrigerated dessert display case, and separate refrigerated storage. Having three separate appliances requires a significant footprint and galley/kitchen floor space is at a premium. (Three section modular unit that can be integrated into one MCFC).  The footprint currently occupied by having separate appliances is not nearly as efficient as it could be.  The utilization of Commercial (COTS) equipment components is preferred. <br><br>A need exists to develop a single cold food serving appliance that can take the place of multiple separate appliances currently used. By taking a cold food counter and integrating refrigerated storage beneath and a refrigerated dessert display case above, the overall serving line footprint can be reduced. <br><br>OPERATIONAL CONCEPT:<br><br>The MCFC will be used by both the Navy and Air Force.  In order to reduce the serving line footprint, the cold food serving line will have refrigerated drawer storage underneath that is able to accommodate six full size hotel pans (20"X 12.5"). Above the serving line will be a refrigerated dessert display case. In order to be put the MCFC aboard a naval vessel it must be able to fit through a 26"x66" hatch.  To accomplish this, the MCFC must be modular and put together on-site without welding.  It shall also have provisions for easy lifting and movement by 4 Warfighters.   <br><br>SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:<br><br>The MCFC is expected to meet the majority of the current performance requirements as well as some additional characteristics/capabilities as listed below:<br> 	5 Refrigerated Cold Serving Wells- Able to accommodate full-size, four-inch deep, hotel pans<br> 	6 pan refrigerated drawer storage for full-size, four-inch deep, hotel pans under the serving line<br> 	Refrigerated dessert display case above the serving line<br> 	Power Requirement: 110V/60 Hz/1 , 208V/60  Hz/3  and 440V/60 Hz/3 <br> 	Rugged to withstand the six degrees of motion encountered in a shipboard environment; three translations (surge, sway and heave), and three rotations (roll, pitch and yaw).<br> 	Must be able to remain operable on a 30  incline and undamaged on a 45  incline<br> 	Easy to clean- <br>o	Stainless steel interior and exterior (304 Stainless Steel minimum 16 gauge)<br>o	Must meet NSF-2, NSF-7 and NFPA wiring requirements for foodservice equipment<br>o	Easy access to refrigeration coils for cleaning, repair, and maintenance from the front of the unit<br> 	Modular to fit through a 26"x66" hatch.<br> 	Refrigerator doors must have positive latching mechanisms in both open and closed positions<br> 	Operate within safe levels of radiated and conducted electromagnetic interference, as defined by MIL-STD-461 for naval vessels<br> 	Reduce the overall footprint of having three separate appliances<br> 	MCFC requires options for both lockable caster wheels and flange feet.<br><br>CONTENT AND FORMAT OF ANSWERS AND TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS: <br>The electronic copy of responses is to be in Adobe Acrobat 9, Microsoft Word 2003, or Microsoft Word 2007 compatible format.  The Government is requesting responses from industry to the following questions:<br><br>1.

SUBJECT: The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products (FDA/CTP) is working toward a vision of a fully integrated data environment that will include electronic interfaces to current data sources and efficient and timely access to data that can be used across programs to facilitate the analysis of complex data sets. The market for this type of fully integrated data environment is quickly evolving. To ensure FDA has access to information on the latest innovations, FDA is surveying the marketplace by requesting information and having a vendor fair. FDA will take the information it obtains from the vendor fair into account as it determines how best to structure and implement its Information Technology Infrastructure. <br />2. DISCLAIMER: This SPECIAL NOTICE is issued solely to survey the market and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this NOTICE. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

FDA/CTP will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future request for proposal (RFP).<br />3. BACKGROUND: FDA is working towards a vision for the development/ modernization/ sustainment of a toolset that will include electronic interfaces to currently available data sources and timely data that can be used by multiple sharing across programs to facilitate the analysis of complex data sets.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The ERDC Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL), Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) has a requirement to purchase a Shear Wave Tomography System to nondestructively determine thickness of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement for airfield evaluations, test section construction, and other current and future pavement research projects.  The system requirements are as follows:  Displays near-real time 3D images and thickness measurements with minimal post processing effort in less than three (3) seconds to minimize necessary testing and analysis time in the field; Dry point contact sensor technology which eliminates the requirement for a coupling medium; Thickness error of 0.5 inches or less with one sample; Compact size, including case, for ease of use and transportability (22 in. x 14 in. x 9 in., 28 lbs); Multiple transducers for repeated measurements within one test for accuracy; Self-calibrating/can determine the shear wave speed of concrete to eliminate the coring of pavement; Spring-loaded transducers for the ability to conform to rough surfaces; Self-contained system to include a screen on the system for measurement verification in the field.  During a recent research project on nondestructive pavement thickness devices, it was determined that the MIRA-5000 Shear Wave Tomography System is the only device that has this technology.  Germann Instruments, Inc. is the sole distributor of the MIRA-5000 in North America.  <br><br>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil with the solicitation number referenced in subject line no later than 4:00 PM CST on December 28, 2011.

<DESC>ONR requires an effort to focus on identification of thruster components with highest potential for fatigue failure, determination of methods to identify impending failures and action to minimize the possibility of unexpected casualties through component replacements. Current inspection procedures and techniques should be reviewed, and emerging technology that has potential to improve inspections should be evaluated. Frequency of inspections and component replacements should be evaluated in view of the above failure analyses and a recommended plan developed.

Offers will be evaluated based on price and the factors set forth in paragraph (a), of the referenced clause, and award will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Government.

Provide contact information on these projects.  Statements by past clients may be used in the evaluation of the vendor's technical quote under any and all applicable evaluation criteria.

In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be more important than evaluated price.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>
<p>Closing date/time for submission of quotations is 06 JAN 2012 at 1100 AM Pacific Time. Ensure that in addition to prices, quotes include applicable representations and certifications and all other information required by above incorporated clauses.

Participants in these training programs are health care professionals who come to training with considerable clinical communication and supervisory skills, but who need to deepen these skills so as to become more effective trainers and coaches of other clinicians. During each of the  7  training programs, two 4-hour sessions are devoted to exercises that require participants to work with "standardized patients" or "standardized clinicians" that will enable training program participants to practice and deepen clinical communication and coaching skills. 

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision and other resources required to deliver 10 actors for each of 14 4-hour training sessions that will occur during the 7  training programs listed above.  The contractor must ensure that actors have been adequately prepared and trained to provide: 1)  realistic and reproducible portrayals of patients and clinicians based on specific and detailed  "case vignettes" that will be provided to contractor by NCP;  2) detailed learner-centered and behaviorally specific feedback to participants on their use of the specific communication and counseling skills that are featured in the training programs; and  3) portrayals that accurately reflect the characteristics, culture and behaviors of Veteran patients and VHA clinicians.  

The contractor must meet the following requirements as well as  all the  requirements specified in Section 7 (Objectives) below:

1.	Specific and extensive experience in recruiting, training and supervising actors to serve as standardized patients and standardized clinicians for training programs in clinical communication skills for health care professionals.  Membership in the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE)  and adherence to ASPE standards is desirable; 
2.	Specific experience in training and providing standardized patients for VHA EES-supported clinical education programs. Specific experience in providing standardized patients for VHA-supported motivational interviewing training is desired;
3.	Only professional actors may serve as standardized patients/clinicians; actors must  have previous experience in portraying simulated "patients" as well as "clinicians" in medical education training programs;



3.  Background:     
Employee Education System (EES) is the largest VHA provider for employee education services.  As a recognized leader and trendsetter in education, EES delivers the highest quality instructional programming to meet customer expectations. Face-to-face conferences/workshops are but one means of meeting the educational needs of VHA employees.

EES is seeking to provide the highest quality of care to Veterans of our nation through Patient Centered Care.  Patient Centered Care is an innovative approach to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is grounded in mutually beneficial partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. Patient-and family-centered care applies to patients of all ages, and it may be practiced in any health care setting. 

Patient-Centered Care also has a focus on staff. To succeed, a patient-centered approach should also address the staff experience, because the staff's ability and inclination to care effectively for patients is important.  Therefore, through the utilization of motivational interviewing, coaching and implementing communication skills, staff will be better equipped to service patients. 

4.   Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be one year from date of award.

<CONTACT>C Scott Phelps, Contracting Officer, Phone 9104326145, Email conway-phelps@soc.mil
<DESC>The following are the Government's responses to questions received.<br /><br />1. General: Will USASOC grant a seven day extension to the current proposal due date (to 11 January, 2012), or a 7-day extension from the date of issue of answers to questions, whichever is later? <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: An extension is not anticipated at this time. However, the Government reserves the right to extend the requirement prior to solicitation close.
<p>2. General: Is a pdf format for the electronic delivery of quote acceptable? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Yes</p>
<p>3. General: The solicitation states "The Government desires delivery not more than 60 days after receipt of order." Is it the Governments desire to have the all 12 deliverables completed within 60 days of kickoff meeting? Are the 60 days calendar days or work days?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: 60 calendar days after the kickoff meeting. This software solution should be considered a COTS item with minimal R&amp;D or vendor development.</p>
<p>4. General: The solicitation states "Additionally, vendors must be able to provide/perform an interactive demo of their proposed software solution." When is demo to be performed?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Upon proposal submission, vendors will provide recommended dates for the Government to consider. Anticipated demo dates would begin after solicitation close, 04 JAN 12 as part of the Government's evaluation.</p>
<p>5. General: What level security clearance is required on this effort?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: None. Personnel shall be escorted during training &amp; installation. However, background checks will be done on all contractor personnel entering the Government facilities.</p>
<p>6. OS: What Operating System will be used for the Digital Asset Management system?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<p>7. Servers: How may servers will be deployed? Will a back-up or failover server be required? Are the servers' clusters or standalone? Is the USASOC running 64 bit servers?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Two servers from HP, G-2 and a G-6. G-6 will serve as primary and the G-2 will serve as secondary for fail safe. Both 64 bit servers are on the same network and domain.</p>
<p>8. Database: What database will the Government provide for storage of data as well as storage of any Meta data that is required? Is it incumbent of the offerer to include the database for storage and for Meta data storage?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Database should be open like mysql, and metadata is to be written to the actual file, such XMP or IPTC.</p>
<p>9. Storage Size: What is the initial size (in GB) for the data that will be stored? What is the annual growth of the size of the database for years 1, 2, and 3?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Currently around 4 TB, but will grow at an exponential rate upon having a DAMS ready to ingest new assets.</p>
<p>10. Section 5 Deliverables, B2: <br />a. Does the DAMS need to perform fuzzy text-type searching (which overcomes OCR errors and typos) and/or concept searching (which expands search terms using a Thesaurus), or is Boolean-type searching sufficient? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: As stated in the SOO, the DAM will use metadata/keywords, applied by History Office personnel, to perform searches.</p>
<p>b. Will the Government please confirm that keyword searching must work across the full text of the file, and not just the metadata? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Just metadata</p>
<p>11. Section 5 Deliverables, B.9: <br />a. Will the Government please specify the multimedia formats that must be played? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: m4a, mp3, mpa, .wav, wma, avi, flv, mov, mp4, mpg, swf, wmv.</p>
<p>b. Which multimedia viewers will be part of the standard software configuration on each workstation? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Irrelevant as this deliverable stipulates that the above formats are playable within the DAM without the viewers being installed on the users' workstation.</p>
<p>12. Section 5 Deliverables, B.10: <br />a. Will the Government please define the word "support"; i.e., does this simply mean view the file and maintain associated metadata records? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Support means the DAM should be able to play an audio/video file, open and display individual pages of documents/presentations/PDFs, and render image formats (i.e. Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, TIF, JPG, PNG).</p>
<p>b. Can the DAMS use a Java applet as a viewer? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: No, as this would require the user's browser to have the Java plug-in, which we can't guarantee.</p>
<p>c. Does the standard software configuration for workstations include plug-in viewers for each of the file formats listed? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: No.</p>
<p>13. Section 5 Deliverables, B.11: <br />a. Will the Government please clarify the functionality required when the DAMS is "integrated" with the Adobe Creative Suite? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Dam will be able to render full resolution .psd, .ia, and .indd files. User must also be able to open files in native software directly from DAM (assuming said software is installed on user's machine). All pages in a multipage InDesign file must be fully displayed and able to be exported as a PDF. DAM assets can be dragged directly into a .indd, .psd, .ia which also automatically adds this usage to its metadata.</p>
<p>b. It appears from the answers to questions during the RFI that when a user attempts to open a file, the DAMS must simply utilize the correct Adobe Creative Suite application to open the file in its native format. Is this interpretation correct? For example, if the DAMS returns an InDesign file (indd extension), and the users clicks to open the InDesign file, then the DAMS launches InDesign. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: This is correct though, as described above, USASOC requires a tighter integration than simply opening the file in its native software.</p>
<p>14. Section 5 Deliverables, B.12: Will the Government please clarify how DAMS is to work in order to satisfy this requirement? We see two possibilities, as follows: 1) When an image is taken from the DAMS and put into a file being created in InDesign or MS Office Suite, a label based on metadata will be automatically created in the new document in InDesign or MS Office Suite; or 2) When an image is taken from the DAMS and put into a file being created in InDesign or MS Office Suite, the final destination of the image will be recorded in the metadata record for that image back in the DAMS. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Answered previously.</p>
<p><br />15. Section 3 a. Coordinate, plan, and execute installation <br />Question - Does the Govt. expect that the contractor will conduct a requirements verification survey, configure the software to work in the USASOC environment, provide the hardware, software, install the system, conduct user training, user acceptance testing, and initial systems operation or to only provide the DAMS software to the govt. and the govt. staff will execute the installation? If the prior scenario is required, can the govt. provide detailed configurations of the existing environment, storage requirements, transaction volumes, and approximate number of Digital Assets currently in the archive so that we can accurately formulate a proposal that does not provide less than the Government is expecting, but has not defined in the current SOW.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Vendor shall conduct a requirements verification survey, configure the software to work in the USASOC environment, software, install the system, conduct user training, user acceptance testing, and initial systems operation.<br /><br />16. Sections 3 b. Develop database transition/ingestion plans <br />Question - Does the govt. expect the contractor to analyze the existing repository, develop a transition plan, and transfer all legacy data into the new DAMS system or merely provide the govt. a well-designed transition plan that the govt. will perform? If the prior is required, can the govt. provide existing metadata and target metadata requirements so that we can formulate a proposal that ensures data and software interoperability for the Government.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Government Response</span></strong>: The Government expects the vendor to analyze the sixteen (16) existing databases, collaborate with Government personnel on a formulating a collation/ingestion plan, and then implement it.<br /><br />17. Section 5.a. The contractor will provide licenses for 20 users, technical support for 3 years, and annual upgrades for 3 years. <br />Question - Annual upgrades - Is this question intended to mean implemented and installed or just made available?<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Government Response</strong></span>: Made available<br /><br />18. Section 5.a. Implied Task - Post Implementation <br />Question - As the govt. desires changes to the original application does it expect those changes to be accommodated within this SOW or will a separate task be created?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: If the application is custom, desired changes will be transmitted to the vendor and implemented on an annual basis- as described by "annual upgrades for 3 years".<br /><br />19. Section 5.a. Post Implementation Technical Support <br />Question - Is the contractor expected to provide post implementation technical support? Is that support expected to be on-site? What are the response time requirements for either on-site or remote service? Can the govt. define exactly what it expects the contractor to provide as support post implementation?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Yes, as described by "The contractor will provide....technical support for 3 years... (5.A.). Should an issue arise, resolution will be sought telephonically. Should this fail, an on-site visit will be required as the server not connected to the Internet.<br /><br />20. Section 5.b. The contractor shall provide a digital asset management software package with the following features:</p>
<p>3) Selective access to assets based on permissions set by administrator. <br />Question - Is the contractor responsible for setting up and implementing the Access Control List or just provide a system capable of providing an ACL?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Provide a system capable of providing an ACL.</p>
<p><br />21. Section: Applied metadata is permanently attached to asset, not linked in an external/additional database or document. <br />Question - Does the govt. have a specific implementation they have in mind for embedding the metadata into their images or will they accept whatever format and methodology the contractor designs? If the govt. has a standard can they provide that information?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: The only standard is that it be&nbsp;non-proprietary and that any metadata applied to the asset is retrievable outside a DAM. The DAM must also have a flexible method of developing different schema for the various functional section of the History Office.<br /><br />22. Section: Scalable to accommodate the millions of assets we plan to catalog in the near future. <br />Question - Can the govt. be more specific than "millions." Are we talking 10 million or 100 million or more? This speaks to accurate scoping of the task so that the Government does not buy too much or too little capability.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: 15 million</p>
<p>23. Section: Asset ingestion must automatically trigger a custom work-flow process that is identified in advance. <br />Question - Can the govt. provide the workflow desired? A simple flow diagram will suffice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: No, because the work-flow varies per the type of asset ingested and is constantly adapted to load and individual</p>
<p>24. Section 12. Images used in publications are automatically identified and labeled. <br />Question - Can the govt. provide the label/identified it desires automatically appended to each digital asset?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: This ties into the adobe software integration- as assets are dragged from the DAM and into InDesign, the essence metadata should automatically be marked as having been used in the publication. When the publication's .indd file is pulled up in the DAM, all nested imagery is linked to the essence asset and vice-versa.</p>
<p>25. Question. What "compatibility issues" are anticipated with the History Office Server?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: The Government has no way of knowing a vendor's SW issues. However, vendors have base-line knowledge of the issues with their SW against different types of servers.</p>
<p>26. Question: Is onsite technical support required after implementation for 3 years or is remote assistance an option?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: Remote assistance is allowable (see Government response 17).</p>
<p>27. Q: For on-site training, how many users for user-level training and advance training?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: SOR section 5.a states licenses for 20 users. The Government anticipates Advance training for five (5) personnel.</p>
<p>28. Q: Will USASOC provide an on-site training facility and equipment? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: The vendor will install at the Government's facility, but the contractor must provide all items to install their software. Ancillary ADP can be made available.</p>
<p>29. Q: Is training documentation be required?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: The Government does not require training documentation beyond a list of all the users trained and given license to use the software.</p>
<p>30. Q: Will content level security be required on the assets?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Response</span></strong>: For solicitation purposes, the assets will be Unclassified/FOUO.</p>

The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations.<br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. BEP will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.<br />The total response (not including brochures) is limited to 10 pages. All responses will be in Windows compatible format. Information will be sent via email attachment only.<br />The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) produces currency for the United States. BEP is seeking a commercially available spectro-densitometer that can measure color and density rapidly and accurately on an unprinted moving sheet of paper in order to assess paper quality and suitability prior to print.<br />BEP is requesting information from vendors who can provide a system that can meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; Spectral measurement, using 10nm wavelength intervals or smaller in the VIS region<br />&bull; Capable of self-triggering and external triggering (for example, encoder based) to make measurement<br />&bull; Full set of color and density measurements at a rate of at least 2 per millisecond, to accommodate a fast moving sheet.<br />&bull; Should provide an electrical output(s) when measurement(s) outside programmed specifications are encountered.<br />&bull; Should be a contactless measurement - preferably several millimeters away from the sheet.<br />&bull; Sampling (measurement) spot should be as small as possible, preferably less than 5mm. <br />&bull; Should accommodate any inherent sheet waviness, and also sheet flutter during movement that may result in vertical displacement of the sheet towards or away from measurement system, or slight angular changes.<br />&bull; Should withstand factory conditions such as vibrations, dust, and ambient light changes.<br />Specific information related to the above would also include the accuracy, repeatability and range of the measurements. A plot (or data) illustrating the variation in measurement with distance/angle from the target would be useful. The CIE color spaces, density standards (along with associated details) supported should be listed. <br />Any other information that the interested party may wish to provide about the hardware and functionality of the measurement system such as measurement scheme, geometry, parameters (spot size, measurement time, processing time), instrument size, electrical requirements, interfaces, etc. is welcome. BEP also seeks additional information/examples related to the graphical display and storage of the measurements (if any) - specifically the format, content, and statistical computations.<br />The Vendor will provide their lead time for delivery and an initial estimated cost. A copy of the vendor's brochures and technical information on their systems is requested in PDF format.</p>
