The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price, delivery, and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the Offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description as specified above that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  The technical quote will be more significant than the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors should also discuss whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract, with desired delivery 30 days after receipt of order.  The vendor must state actual delivery time in the offer.
