This requirement shall not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Pursuant to FAR 7.303, the Government has synopsized the requirement on two separate occasions (30 May 01 and 03 Jul 01). It was determined that this acquisition shall proceed on an Other Than Full and Open Competition Basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute (under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5)).  The Air Force will proceed on a sole source basis for award under the 8(a) Program as cited in 15 U.S.C. 637.  Section 8014 of Public Law 105-262 permits direct conversions to qualified firms that have 51 percent or more Native American Ownership (NAO).  Pursuant to FAR 19.805-1(b)(2), the SBA may accept the requirement for a sole source 8(a) award if the SBA accepts the requirement on behalf of a concern owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation.  The SBA accepted this requirement on behalf of Ahtna Government Services Corporation (Ahtna), a qualified NAO firm.  The Contractor shall provide repair, delivery, and pickup of furniture and appliances to on-base family and unaccompanied housing (UH), and to off-base quarters on the island of Oahu for personnel authorized overseas furnishings support for Hickam AFB and Bellows Air Force Station.  The Contractor shall provide FMO services for military family housing (MFH), dormitories, unaccompanied officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) quarters, and Fire Department sleeping and entertainment areas.  The Contractor shall provide Supplemental and Special Command Position furnishings as required.  Supplemental furnishings are authorized for installation commanders, general officers, Brigadier General selects, and civilian equivalents residing in government housing.  The Contractor shall ensure all occupied quarters are provided with serviceable appliances and customers are provided with allowable furnishings in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-6004 and reference publications. In providing these requirements, the contractor is required to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and services necessary  (except specified Government furnished property and services) to perform all FMO operations as defined in the Statement of Work. The Contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) program in order to receive a contract award from any DoD activity. The Contractor may access the Internet at http://www.ccr2000.com/ to register and/or obtain more information about the CCR program. The applicable NAICS Code is 493110, with a small business size standard of $18.5 million. The contract performance period is anticipated to run from 01 Apr 02 through 30 Sep 02, with four (4)one-year option periods.
The Not to Exceed amount for this effort is $6,143,179.  The Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments to the RFP, and related information may only be downloaded from the Electronic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov/. The solicitation is anticipated to be available on or about 20 Aug 01.

<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 the EPA's National Vehicle and Fule Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) is in need of a modern power drive system for an existing DC dynamometer.  Heavy Duty Test Cell #2 is equipped with a GE 600 HP electric double ended reversing dynamometer.  A motor-generator set and original GE controls power the dynamometers. The dynamometer system was installed in the 1970's.  The scope of activity in this procurement is to replace the motor generator and GE control with a modern Digital DC Drive and a manual dynamometer controller. Heavy Duty test cell #2 is an engine dynamometer test cell.  The test cell is designed to run transient and steady state exhaust emission tests on large engines, primarily diesel.  These engines are typically used in on-highway truck applications, or non-road applications such as agricultural equipment.  The engines tested in this test cell typically have rated power values from 100 to 450 HP.  The engines are directly coupled to the dynamometer with a vibration dampening drive shaft.  The testing consists of steady mode operation as well as transient testing simulating a city or highway driving experience.  During testing, the exhaust emissions can be sampled and measured along with many other parameters including actual engine power output.  Finally, emission rates are calculated to yield brake specific results or mass of emissions per unit of engine work.  Testing is conducted according to U.S. Federal Standards (40 CFR 86) and standards from other international governing bodies. The procurement is for a dynamometer power drive system and a manual dynamometer controller.  The contractor will provide for electrical disconnection of all old equipment, installation of new equipment, connection of new equipment to power grid and dynamometer, drive commissioning, and training of EPA personnel.   A site visit is currently scheduled for March 14, 2002 between 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m..  Please contact Karen Reese (734) 214-4451 to request access to the site. Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the Statement of Work and RFQ (SF-1449) to Scott Tharp at the above address by Fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  The above information is also available at our website http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>On 27 June 2000, it was announced under direction of the Department of Defense and Air Force, that the Furnishings Management Office (FMO) function is to be the subject of an A-76 Direct Conversion Study. The study will determine whether it is cost effective for this requirement to be performed under contract. This requirement shall not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Pursuant to FAR 7.303, the Government has synopsized the requirement on two separate occasions (30 May 01 and 03 Jul 01). It was determined that this acquisition shall proceed on an Other Than Full and Open Competition Basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute (under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5)).  The Air Force will proceed on a sole source basis for award under the 8(a) Program as cited in 15 U.S.C. 637.  Section 8014 of Public Law 105-262 permits direct conversions to qualified firms that have 51 percent or more Native American Ownership (NAO).  Pursuant to FAR 19.805-1(b)(2), the SBA may accept the requirement for a sole source 8(a) award if the SBA accepts the requirement on behalf of a concern owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation.  The SBA accepted this requirement on behalf of Ahtna Government Services Corporation (Ahtna), a qualified NAO firm.  The Contractor shall provide repair, delivery, and pickup of furniture and appliances to on-base family and unaccompanied housing (UH), and to off-base quarters on the island of Oahu for personnel authorized overseas furnishings support for Hickam AFB and Bellows Air Force Station.  The Contractor shall provide FMO services for military family housing (MFH), dormitories, unaccompanied officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) quarters, and Fire Department sleeping and entertainment areas.  The Contractor shall provide Supplemental and Special Command Position furnishings as required.  Supplemental furnishings are authorized for installation commanders, general officers, Brigadier General selects, and civilian equivalents residing in government housing.  The Contractor shall ensure all occupied quarters are provided with serviceable appliances and customers are provided with allowable furnishings in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-6004 and reference publications. In providing these requirements, the contractor is required to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and services necessary  (except specified Government furnished property and services) to perform all FMO operations as defined in the Statement of Work. The Contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) program in order to receive a contract award from any DoD activity. The Contractor may access the Internet at http://www.ccr2000.com/ to register and/or obtain more information about the CCR program. The applicable NAICS Code is 493110, with a small business size standard of $18.5 million. The contract performance period is anticipated to run from 01 Apr 02 through 30 Sep 02, with four (4)one-year option periods.
The Not to Exceed amount for this effort is $6,143,179.  The Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments to the RFP, and related information may only be downloaded from the Electronic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov/. The solicitation is anticipated to be available on or about 20 Aug 01.

<DESC>TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS for this RFA (Request for Applications) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This RFA is SET ASIDE for transportation-related public agencies, including state or local departments of transportation, and state or local mass transit agencies.  The FHWA will NOT accept applications from private or commercial companies; and the FHWA will NOT accept applications from non-profit or not-for-profit agencies.  There is NO INCUMBENT contractor, and NO INCUMBENT recipient.  In this RFA, which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) currently estimates will be published on approximately March 20, 2002 in FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov, the FHWA will be seeking Applications for a new Cooperative Agreement to be entitled ?TMC Applications of Archived Data Operational Test?.  The Recipient of that Cooperative Agreement will execute an operational test to study how the operational practices and procedures of a Transportation Management Center (TMC) can benefit through the applied use of archived data from highway-based and/or transit-based Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) sources.  The project will include an examination of how specific TMC functions can be enhanced through performance measures and analytical techniques enabled through archived data.  The results of the operational test will be used to support the development of guidance for applying archived data to enhance TMC operations, practices and procedures.  In this operational test the archived data will be applied to effect transportation operations and management decisions.  The operational test will consider how currently employed methods that apply archived data can be refined and reproduced.  This project will focus on integrated archiving that combines ITS collected data from two or more ITS sources (or centers, as they are defined in the National ITS Architecture).  The ITS sources are likely to include archived weather events, speed, travel time, transit vehicle and/or traffic volume records corresponding to special events along with recurring congestion.  In addition, this operational test will supply a historical context on traffic and travel conditions that supply TMC services such as 511 traveler information service.  It is currently estimated that the resulting new cooperative agreement will be cost-reimbursable, with an estimated 18-month period of performance.  The FHWA does reserve the right to award more than one cooperative agreement from this RFA, but the making of more than one award is currently considered unlikely.  TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THIS RFA WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective Applicants (i.e., offerors) are to obtain the RFA from FedBizOpps, at http://www.eps.gov. Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFA will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out any HARD COPIES of any such Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each Applicant to closely and frequently MONITOR FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFA.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFA will be absolutely ESSENTIAL for all prospective Applicants, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.  Please note that the due date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which Applications will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for the FHWA?s receipt of Applications will be stated in the RFA.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, announces the availability of a Broad Agency Announcement/Request for Proposals (BAA/RFP) to establish training and research facilities that would support the study of rodent models of spinal cord injury (SCI).  The NINDS is the lead governmental agency for the funding of research on SCI, and proposes to establish national Facilities of Research Excellence in SCI (FOR-SCI) that will train new researchers on best practices in the field of SCI, including the standards of current research methodology, analytical protocols and functional outcome evaluations.  Under this BAA, these facilities will provide, in the same location, resources, capabilities and expertise in SCI research.  These will include the ability to work with multiple standard models of injury in rats and/or mice, and the facilities and personnel for expert handling, care and the medical management of animals with SCI.  They will have dedicated facilities and expertise for conducting surgery, including microsurgery such as transplants and grafts, and for cellular analyses ranging from neuroanatomy and histology to electrophysiology and other cutting-edge technologies.  These facilities will also provide training for individuals from graduate students to faculty, both within and outside of the organization, to promote consistency of procedures and practices across laboratories.  A facility/center should also be able to provide training on the assessment of standard outcome measures and to participate in the development of new and relevant means of evaluating recovery from spinal cord dysfunction.  Another role of the support shall be to review and replicate novel treatments for SCI, and to compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses.  Finally, these sites could be the nuclei/nexus for collaborative studies on SCI.  It is anticipated that one or two cost-reimbursement type contracts will be made for a period of five years in September 2002.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  BAA/Request for Proposal (BAA/RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-02-09 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to numbered note 26.  ****

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposals (RFP OAM-2002-N-007).  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in eight parts: (1)Background and Specific Requirements; (2) Cost Proposals; (3) Format and Instructions for Technical Proposal, (4) Technical Evaluation Criteria; (5) Applicability of Federal Acquisition Regulation Provisions,  (6) Technical Questions and Bidders' Library, (7) Point of Contact and (8) Submission of Offers.  1. BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS:  The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) has a need for delivery of Retirement (Mid-Career) Seminars and Retirement Planning Seminars.  The Compensation and Benefits Group, a component of GAO's Human Capital Office, is responsible for providing retirement services to GAO employees.  Many federal agencies, including GAO, have offered pre-retirement planning seminars as one of those services.  Typically, the mid-career retirement seminars are made available to employees who are within 10-15 years of retirement eligibility and the Retirement Planning Seminars are made available to employees who are within 5 years of retirement eligibility.  Both seminars last for several days, and provide in-depth information to assist the employees in making critical decisions as they approach and prepare for retirement. The Compensation and Benefits Group does not possess the necessary subject matter knowledge to conduct pre-retirement seminars of the scope desired, nor is such expertise available elsewhere in GAO.  In addition, by addressing groups rather than single employees, the seminars represent a cost-effective way of conveying need of information. (A) Scope of work: The contractor will provide an off-the-shelf seminar meeting GAO's requirements.  The Mid-Career seminar session will be delivered two (2) days in length.  60 participants normally will attend each session.  It is estimated that the Mid-Career seminar will be delivered at least three (3) times each fiscal year (FY) from FY 2003 through FY 2007.   The Retirement Planning seminar session will be delivered three (3) days in length.  30 participants normally will attend each session.  However, there may be a need to enroll up to five (5) additional participants. It is estimated that the Retirement Planning seminar will be delivered at least (4) four times each fiscal year (FY)from FY 2003 through FY 2007.  The contractor will also be required to perform a walk-through of each seminar.  The walk-through is intended to be an oral presentation to be made by one or more of the contractor's representatives.  It must describe the contents of each seminar and the teaching methodologies intended to be used for each seminar component.  This will give GAO representatives the opportunity to ask questions and seek additional information, as they deem necessary.  The estimated time for the walk-through is 2 to 8 hours for each seminar, the actual time can not be determined since GAO is unable to determine how much detail that the contractor will be providing and the extent of questions GAO representatives will raise.  The contractor may be required to perform a second walk-through (depending on the extent of changes resulting from the initial walk-through) at no additional charge to GAO.  (B) Course Contents: The objectives of the seminars are to provide employees with an array of information to increase the participants' level of understanding and awareness of policies and procedures.  Also the training will enable them to better plan and make better decisions about retirement. The contractor will use teaching techniques appropriate to the subject matter and the audience.  Each seminar will cover at a minimum the following subjects:  Mid-Career: Federal Retirement System (FERS and CSRS); Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program as they affect retirement; Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); Social Security Benefits; and Financial planning.   Retirement Planning: Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS); Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and (Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program as they affect retirement Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); Annuities and survivors' benefits; Social Security, as it relates to federal retirees, and Medicare; Financial planning; Estate planning; Legal issues related to retirement, including wills; Life after retirement; and Health and fitness in retirement.  (C) Course Materials: The contractor will prepare seminar binders containing written materials for each of the subjects to be covered and provide GAO with a binder for each participant.  GAO will provide the contractor with a list of retirement-related publications that it makes available to its staff so that the contractor can avoid unnecessary expenses in providing materials already available to seminar participants. The contractor will be responsible for providing any audio or visual materials to be used in delivering the seminars.   GAO will provide an overhead projector, projection screen, and flipcharts.  If the contractor intends to use other equipment, the type of equipment should be identified in its proposal.  GAO will provide it if it already possesses it but otherwise it will be the contractor's responsibility to provide it.  (D) Deliverables: (1) within 20 working days after the effective date of the contract, the contractor will conduct an initial walk-through of the Retirement Mid-Career and Retirement Planning Seminars.  All course materials, (including but not limited to the instructor's guide, participant manual, overhead transparencies, handouts, other visual material, and audio material) to be used must be provided at that time; (2) Within 20 working days after the initial walk-through, the contractor will make revisions to both seminars contents as agreed upon with the COTR.  If requested by the COTR, the contractor will conduct a second walk-through at no additional cost to GAO; (3) On agreed-upon dates, the contractor will conduct sessions for the retirement planning and mid-career seminars, using qualified instructors.  GAO will provide classroom space for the seminar sessions; and (4) no later than the working day before each seminar session, the contractor will provide GAO with a binder for each participant.  (E) Training Location: All seminar sessions will be held in the GAO Headquarters Building (441 G Street, NW, Washington, D.C.) or in other designated space in the downtown Washington, DC area provided by GAO.  (F) Schedule of Classes - Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year of the contract, the GAO COTR will inform the contractor how many seminar sessions for each of the Retirement (Mid-Career) and Retirement Planning sessions that it anticipates conducting during the year.  In addition, the COTR will indicate if GAO has preferences as to session dates.  Although the contractor will, to the extent feasible, provide sessions on the dates requested, the dates for each session will be arrived at by mutual agreement between the contractor and the COTR. During the course of a fiscal year, GAO may request additional seminar sessions.  Subject to mutual agreement between the contractor and the COTR on session dates, such sessions will be added at the contract price in effect at the time of the request. Each class day (including lunch and break time) will be 7 to 8 hours, beginning no earlier than 8 a.m. and ending no later than 4:30 p.m.  There will be a one-hour lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. and at least one 15-minute break in each the morning and afternoon (H) Evaluation of Course - GAO will evaluate the course using participant questionnaires developed by GAO, and provide the results of the evaluations to the contractor.  If the contractor wants to use its own evaluation form (which should be included in its technical proposal), GAO will distribute it to seminar participants.  However, it will augment--not replace--GAO's form. 2. COST PROPOSALS:  Offerors are required to request via email (Dannerp@GAO.gov) or fax (202) 512-3999 a copy of the pricing schedule. Failure to complete and submit the pricing may exclude your offer from consideration. The Pricing Schedule will identify fixed rates over the five-year contract period.

Technical proposals should not exceed 25 pages. Pages beyond 25 will not be considered. Offerors that fail to furnish required representation and certifications or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from further consideration.  4. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - - Commercial Items.  This a best value procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. Also, the government reserves the right to make an award on the basis of initial proposal, without holding discussions.  Therefore, the offeror initial proposal should contain their best terms from a technical and cost standpoint. The following elements are to be included in your technical proposal. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers and should be addressed in your technical proposal:   (a) Technical Approach and Management (20 points):  The offeror must submit a description of the services it will provide that demonstrates it clearly understands the Statement of Work and all required details of the RFP.  The offeror also must submit a management plan, indicating how it will assure that the contract work is properly and timely performed.  The plan must include a description of how it will interact with GAO's Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (a member of GAO's Compensation and Benefits group).  (b) Seminar Materials (15 points):  The offeror must submit a course agenda, indicating all major topics to be covered, the order in which they are to be covered, the amount of time to be allotted to each, and the teaching techniques to be used (e.g., lecture, discussion, audio-visual presentations).  The offeror also must submit a participant binder containing written materials for each of the subjects to be covered in the seminar.  (c) Corporate Experience and Past Performance (including references), (35 points):  The offeror must demonstrate that it has substantial experience in presenting pre-retirement planning seminars or in performing similar work, and that it has performed such work satisfactorily within the last three (3) years.  To do so, the offeror must submit names of all federal government agencies for which it has presented pre-retirement seminars or performed similar work.  The offeror also may submit names of non-federal entities for which it has performed such work.  For each named federal government agency and non-federal entity for which the offeror has, within the past three (3) years, presented pre-retirement seminars or performed similar work, the offeror must include the name, address, and phone number of a contact person who works for the agency or entity and, if relevant, contract numbers.  GAO reserves the right to contact any of the named agencies and entities.  If the offeror intends to subcontract any of the work (except through personal service contracts with individual instructors), it must provide, for each subcontractor, the information requested in the previous two paragraphs as well as copies of any subcontract agreements already in effect.  In evaluating past performance, GAO will consider information obtained from past and present customers.  By past performance, GAO means the offeror's record of conformity to specifications and to standards of good workmanship, of adherence to contract schedules, and of cooperation and commitment to customer satisfaction.  (d) Experience of Instructors (30 Points) - The offeror must identify the instructors it intends to use in presenting seminars, indicating which topic(s) are to be covered by each instructor.  If the offeror intends to rotate instructors (i.e., to use different instructors for a particular topic at different seminar sessions rather than using only one for the topic at all sessions), it must identify each instructor it intends to use.  If the offeror intends to use only one instructor for a topic at all sessions, it must identify an alternate instructor to be used in the event the principal instructor is not available. For each principal and alternate instructor, the offeror must submit a resume containing sufficient information to enable GAO to determine whether the individual possesses the experience and/or education needed to meet its requirement.  5.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to replace a slip ring unit and cooling jacket assembly specifically designed and manufactured by Litton Poly-Scientific for use in a unique experimental test article. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) pursuant to FAR Part 13. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from  Litton Poly-Scientific, Blacksburg Operation, 1213 North Main Street, Blacksburg, VA  24060/800-336-2112.   Little Poly-Scientiific has manufactured and provided slip ring and cooling jacket assembly of identical design for previous effort.  Comparable devices are available through a variety of manufacturers although the unique requirements of 100+ data channels and high-speed operation reduce the available pool of suppliers.  All devices except that manufactured by Litton Poly-Scientific required modifications or addiitonal components to interface with existing hardware.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local March 12, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Statement Of Work

Obstetrical Services for the Fort Peck Service Unit in the Billings Area Indian Health Service

I.	Acquisition Background and Objectives

1.	Introduction	
The mission of the Fort Peck Indian Health Center is to provide the best possible health care services to the Native American population on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.  To meet the mission, the Fort Peck Service Unit requires contractor support to assist the service unit in the recruitment and placement of obstetrical provider(s) into a temporary duty assignment in the Fort Peck IHS Health Center.  The contract effort shall be tailored to provide a wide range of obstetrical services.

2.	Background Information 
The Fort Peck Service Unit primarily serves two tribes, the Assiniboine and the Sioux tribal nations.  The user population is approximately 8,500 members, and the Service Unit facility is located in the northeast corner of the State of Montana.  There are two ambulatory health care centers located on/around the reservation, one located in the township of Wolf Point (Chief Redstone) and the other one in the township of Poplar (Verne E. Gibbs).  The majority of the approximately 170 deliveries per year take place at the Trinity Hospital, a private hospital located in the Wolf Point community.  

3.	Purpose of the Contract
The purpose of the contract is for the recruitment and placement of provider(s) of obstetrical services into the Fort Peck Indian Health Service facility.  The care provided by the Contractor, shall be as comprehensive as the Indian Health Service supplied facilities, equipment and support services permit.  The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, to provide obstetrical services to the Fort Peck Service Unit.  The Indian Health Service requires that obstetrical services continue without interruption during the term of this contract.

4.	Scope of Work 
The Fort Peck Service Unit proposes to contract all of its prenatal, intrapartum, postpartum and newborn care to qualified provider(s) through the award of a Non-Personal Health Care Contract.

A contractor shall not perform medical services until professional staff membership and the Indian Health Service governing body has granted clinical privileges in writing.

The governing body will not grant clinical privileges until it is determined that credentials information has been verified.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Research Contracts Branch (RCB), plans to procure logistical support in preparation of the HBCU/MI Proposal Writing Workshop from Dillard University, 2601 Gentilly Boulevard, New Orleans, LA 70122.  The purpose is to provide the selected institutions's faculty and staff tutorial instruction in the dvelopment of a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP), approaches to cost analyzes, evaluation of proposals, and how to avoid fatal flaws.  Dillard University will provide all the necessary Logistical Support for the workshop.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) continue to play a significant role in the education of minorities, make outstanding intellectual and scientific contributions that are indispensable to the broader society, and serve as centers for ethnic and minority culture.  These institutions, however, have experienced difficulties in writing grants and contracts as a result of competitively issued Request for Proposals (RFP) for Research and Development Requirements (R&D) from the Federal and State Government and in many cases in the private sector as well.  During the 1990s HBCU/MI's comprised approximately 12.7 percent of all U.S. Institutions conducting research and development, yet they received less than 1.5 percent of the research dollars awarded to institutions of higher education.  Dillard University is the only known source to NCI that can provide the necessary services required by the Agency.  Dillard University will provide all services on their Campus in New Orleans, LA.  The services will be performed by Dillard University staff and students.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be in writing and received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EST, on March 20, 2002.  For further information please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  NAICS Code 611710.  PLEASE NOTE: Due to our temporary relocation, all bids/capability statements should be sent to **6116 Executive Blvd., Room 205, Rockville, MD 20892 until further notice.

<RESPDATE>040202
<ARCHDATE>04172002
<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Ion Ivanescu, Director, Refining Division, SNP PETROM SA, 109 Calea Victoriei, 70176 Bucharest ? Romania, Phone:  + (40) 1 659 7051, Fax: + (40) 1 315 9849, Email: i.ivanescu@petrom.ro  :  

Feasibility Study for the Expansion of Petrom?s Arpechim Refinery.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to examine plans to expand the petrochemical facility at Petrom?s Arpechim Refinery in Pitesti, Romania.

Petrom is planning two expansions at the Arpechim facility.  The first will increase current ethylene production capacity by 100,000 metric tons per year (MTY).  The second expansion will add a new polyethylene unit at the Arpechim facility or will revamp and increase the capacity of the existing unit at the Arpechim facility.  Petrom has requested a detailed feasibility study in order to evaluate the technical and economic viability of the proposed expansions, as well as to assess market size.  This project represents a strong developmental priority for the firm as they attempt to modernize their facilities while increasing efficiency.  In addition, as Romania progresses towards becoming a full member of the European Union (EU), Petrom must consider potential domestic and foreign competition in a free market economy.  Both ethylene and polyethylene will be in great demand as these products would be used for producing plastic pipes to replace the current pig-iron pipe system in the gas distribution system throughout the entire country.

The objective of the feasibility study will be two-fold: first, to examine the technical and economic feasibility of expanding the capacity of an existing 200,000 MTY steam cracker unit to 300,000 MTY; second, to install a new polyethylene unit or revamp and increase the capacity of the existing polyethylene unit at the Arpechim facility. 

The study should evaluate the potential size of domestic market and product selling price.  The study should also consider the competitiveness of other domestic producers and potential imports.  Finally, the technical, economic and financial aspects of the project should be addressed as part of the study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $341,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, April 2, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Pennsylvania National Guard is seeking a concessionaire agreement /contract with a corporation, private business, or entity that fosters a winning partnership through the Installation Morale, Welfare, and Recreation-Fund Program (IMWRP).

The Contractor is responsible to finance, construct, and then operate the car wash facility. The Government will in turn negotiate this long-term Concessionaires agreement in which the Contractor or Concessionaire  agrees to pay a percentage of its gross receipts to the FTIG Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Council per month.  *The Davis-Bacon Act does not apply.   Furthermore, this facility shall be operational within 120 days of execution of agreement. The FTIG Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Council requires the Concessionaire to provide the following services and equipment: automatic and manual systems (Mark VII Equipment brand name or equal in its entirety).

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms only in the districts listed as South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) in each district. The estimated time  of performance will be one (1) year and have four 4 twelve months options. BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.
  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.
  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions,
  certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the 
  extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of
  each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for
  accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans
  and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only,
  to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties
  are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will
  be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the
  necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision
  and overhead required to perform the work within the specified
  time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting
  Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA
  holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis. However,
  the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with
  a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount
  less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement. The
  Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will
  consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others. MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications. DESIGN: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items.
  The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed
  in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the SBA District of South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a)program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.
  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed
  cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and
  profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded
  using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.
  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:
  (1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district locations.
  (2) Registered in the Department of Defense Central
  Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit
  the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information

<DESC>NETWORK OF EMBEDDED SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY (NEST), SOL BAA 02-12, DUE: 03/05/03; POC: DR. VIJAY RAGHAVAN, DARPA/ITO; FAX: (703) 522-7161. 
The Network of Embedded Software Technology (NEST) program solicits research to contribute to the theoretical foundation and to the technical solutions for issues in resource-constrained networks of embedded nodes.  Embedded information processing is fast becoming the primary source for superiority in weapons systems.  The current trend is toward "information rich" nodes with little separation between physical processes such as sensing and actuation and computational processes such as monitoring, diagnostics, and overall closed loop system control.  Providing software for coordinating these activities in real time in a distributed network of embedded nodes is the fundamental challenge for the NEST program.  The central themes of NEST are application independent but customizable coordination and synthesis services in networked embedded systems.  Coordination services include fault-tolerant, self-stabilizing protocols for data exchange, synchronization, and replication in large scale (100 to 100,000 node) distributed, real-time systems.  Synthesis services provide time-bounded solutions for complex, distributed constraint satisfaction tasks required for dynamic reconfigurations of applications. 
Limited funds are available for additional research complementing the NEST technology currently being pursued in the program.  Of special interest to this solicitation are the following technical topic areas: 1.  Security in Resource-Constrained Embedded Networks: A significant technical challenge in the building of networks of embedded systems is that severe resource limitations (of memory, bandwidth, power, and computation) must nevertheless be made to work with a high-level of security, given the range of critical applications envisaged for such systems.  Innovative approaches are sought to provide robust solutions for security adaptable to varying levels of resource constraints in such areas as authentication, intrusion detection and tolerance, and encryption.  2.  Mathematical models of NEST systems: Networks of embedded systems with the inherent non-determinism, dynamism and computational and communicational limitations have forced us, time and again, to reexamine the assumptions used by "classical" distributed algorithms.  There is a need for a sound mathematical model for exploring the rich set of complexities induced by the probabilistic and dynamic interaction of the physical and information processes, operating under various bounds.  Of crucial importance, given the extreme scale of such systems, is the ability to predict, analyze, and bound performance "in the large." 
3. Other innovative approaches to problem-solving in the NEST domain.  PROGRAM SCOPE.  Proposed research should specify the topic area 1-3 above that it addresses, and have a research development plan with two phases.  Phase I is a feasibility study of the proposed research and should end in 15 months; the proposal should contain well-defined performance metrics that DARPA program management can use to evaluate a culminating baseline demonstration at the end of Phase I. Phase II will integrate the results with existing NEST technology on experimental platforms of interest to the program.  The duration of the proposed research should be a maximum of three years.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  The duration of the proposed research should be a maximum of three years.  Research that results in prototype software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches in experimental platforms used in the NEST program will receive the highest priority.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  GENERAL INFORMATION.

<SUBJECT>A -- MODEL-BASED INTEGRATION OF EMBEDDED SOFTWARE (MoBIES)
<SOLNBR>BAA02-11
<RESPDATE>030703
<ARCHDATE>03082003
<CONTACT>John Bay, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-522-7161, Email none
<DESC>MODEL-BASED INTEGRATION OF EMBEDDED SOFTWARE (MoBIES), SOL BAA 02-11, DUE:  03/07/03; POC:  DR. JOHN BAY, DARPA/ITO; FAX: (703) 522-7161.  Model-Based Integration of Embedded Software (MoBIES):  The DARPA MoBIES program began in fiscal year 2000 as an effort to formalize the engineering of embedded software design and productivity tools.  This BAA solicits research proposals for additional MoBIES technology development and technology integration, experimentation and evaluation on Open Experimental Platforms (OEPs).  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration.  PROGRAM SCOPE.  Military applications such as advanced vehicles, UAVs, communications and sensing networks, and command and control (C2) systems are all examples of embedded applications that require highly reliable complex software.  Military applications require the most complex software systems ever developed.  Yet, the existing tools and techniques for developing such complex embedded software systems are fast approaching their limits in terms of the size, complexity, optimality, and reliability of the code they produce.  Traditional software development systems for large-scale general-purpose computing are intended for generic code development, not for embedded ? possibly distributed ? applications.  Because they are not tailorable to embedded computing platforms, they do not account for physical constraints and cross-cutting concerns, and they do not provide easily verifiable and validatable code for embedded targets.  The goal of MoBIES is to develop the mathematical models and interface standards necessary to integrate physical descriptions of application domains, high-level specifications of program functionality, and process models for software tools.  In this way, application-specific embedded software design frameworks can be assembled from tools and development components that have been specialized by technology developers who focus on the individual tool technologies and performance requirements associated with each of the many applications of embedded systems.  Because of this ability to application-tailor the development framework from physical models, the tools will automatically accommodate cross-cutting constraints and performance drivers such as real-time scheduling, size/weight/power limitations, fault tolerance, safety, and security.  The frameworks will also result in provably correct or efficiently verifiable code, allowing military users to write distributed embedded system software of complexities beyond what can be reliably produced today.  This BAA solicits research proposals in these two categories, "Technology Developer" and "Evaluation Open Experimental Platform Developer" for the MoBIES Program.  The Technology Developers create the design, productivity, and analysis tools, as well as the open knowledge interchange and meta-data representation standards.  These developers are experts in either specific software analysis technologies (e.g., scheduling or model checking), the generation of provably correct code generators, or integrated embedded software frameworks and execution platform configuration.  Research proposals are being solicited in the following three topic areas in the "Technology Developer" category: 1) Analysis and Design Tools - MoBIES has already produced tools for meta-modeling, process scheduling, resource allocation, model-checking, design view synchronization, and code generation.  Additional tools are sought for these needs and for verification and validation, fault diagnosis and reconfiguration, size/weight/power analysis, cost analysis, optimization, security, and communications. 
2) Model-Based Generators - DARPA is seeking proposals for model-based generator technology, where the focus is on the process of producing and customizing the generators, not the production of the target code itself.  3) Integrated Toolset Architectures - MoBIES is funding the development of individual tools and the translators and data representations necessary to make them interoperable.  This topic area also seeks proposals for the systems-level engineering and interface design of the integrated framework as a whole.  The Evaluation Open Experimental Platform (OEP) Developers provide an open experimental platform test bed (hardware and software) and the target embedded computing environment necessary to host the code that is automatically generated from a domain-tailored system configuration of MoBIES tools.  In addition, Evaluation OEP Developers are responsible for integrating components into the OEP, designing and conducting experiments, and evaluating experimental results.  Research proposals in the "Evaluation OEP Developer" category are being solicited that articulate challenge problems associated with a particular embedded software application domain, and describe performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in domain performance but also require significant technological innovation to realize.  Offerors in the Evaluation OEP Developer category should propose embedded software test platforms of interest to the military, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for Evaluation OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate MoBIES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  MoBIES currently has OEPs that target automotive and military avionics domains.  Research proposals that target additional embedded domains, e.g. software radios, biomedical devices, munitions controllers, etc., are encouraged. 
An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category ("Technology Developer" or "Evaluation OEP Developer"), however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories only.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.

<DESC>NA LOCK CONSTRUCTION, MCALPINE LOCK REPLACEMENT PROJECT, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.  The work consists of construction of a new 1200-foot navigation lock at the McAlpine Locks & Dam as well as construction of a fixed access bridge across both the new lock and an e xisting 1200-foot lock.  The work includes construction of concrete chamber walls (RCC and Conventional), sills, culverts and discharge diffusers. Construction of these items will require rock excavation to founding grades.  The work includes construction of steel miter gates and culvert valves. Construction includes all machinery and controls necessary to operate the lock.  Construction of four service buildings on top of the lock walls is also required. Construction also includes all necessary backfilling  and grading.  The majority of the lock construction will occur within a cofferdam constructed and originally dewatered by others.  Work will include operation and maintenance of the cofferdam.  Work under this contract will also include demolition of the cofferdam.  This demolition will include removal of concrete filled sheet pile cells, sand filled cells and stability berms, and detensioning of high capacity structural anchors in the south wall of the existing 1200-foot lock.  Demolition of the existing swing bridge, bascule bridge and portions of existing concrete and sandstone masonry lock walls are also required.  The work also includes construction of upstream and downstream approach walls.  These walls will consist of precast concrete beams supported  by either concrete caissons drilled into the rock foundation or concrete filled circular sheet pile cells.  The approach wall support type is an alternate to be chosen by the offeror.  It will be necessary to construct portions of both approach walls outs ide of the cofferdam in the wet.  The access bridge will consist of prestressed concrete beams with CIP concrete deck supported by concrete piers founded on drilled caissons.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with New Focus of San Jose, California for a tunable diode laser system to perform chromatic dispersion and spectroscopic measurements of optical fibers and components.  The laser system must have a wavelength tuning range of at least 110 nm covering 1520 to 1630 nm.  This range is necessary to allow measurement quantities such as zero-dispersion wavelength to be reported over the 1530 to 1620 nm band used by optical communications.  The wavelength tuning resolution must be at least 1 pm.  The laser system must also have separate analog wavelength control and frequency modulation (FM) of the emission wavelength made possible through an external connector.  This feature is critical to our FM spectroscopy and laser stabilization projects, where both frequency modulation and feedback to the analog wavelength control is required.  The analog wavelength control must be arbitrarily slow, continuous, and smooth, with a range of 200 pm to allow the scanning of molecular absorption lines we use as wavelength references.  The spectral linewidth of the laser must be no greater than 10 MHz when measured over a 1-second time interval.  It is important to note that most manufacturers use a delayed self-heterodyne technique for the measurement of linewidth.  As a result, specifications based on this technique are only relevant to time intervals on the order of microseconds, which does not account for low frequency noise from mechanical and electrical sources.  For our application the relevant time interval is on the order of seconds or larger, roughly corresponding to our data acquisition times.  Our experience has shown that the best isolation of the laser from mechanical and electrical noise sources is provided by a separate laser head and controller design.  The laser system must maintain single longitudinal mode operation over the required wavelength tuning range, without mode hopes.  The system must have GPIB capability to facilitate measurement automation.  The laser must be capable of emitting 1 mW of output power over the wavelength tuning range.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be fond on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE. Anticipated award date will be March 22, 2002.

<DESC>CSAT/SAMHSA will award a one year contract with four option years.The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment is seeking proposals to enter into a contract to develop, implement, and operate a National Treatment Outcomes Monitoring System (NTOMS) in support of departmental and agency goals and the National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS).  NTOMS will provide data to track drug abuse treatment access and effectiveness as part of the National Drug Control Strategy Performance Measures of Effectiveness (PME) System.  As the lead Federal agency for the improving the treatment of substance-related disorders, CSAT is seeking to establish a outcomes monitoring system that will further enhance its ability to carry out its statutory responsibilities to evaluate treatment programs to determine the quality and appropriateness of various forms of treatment (42 USC 290bb: Sections 507(b)(13) and (14), Title V of the Public Health Services Act) and to provide data for the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  NTOMS is conceptualized as a national surveillance system that will provide periodic reporting on access to and effectiveness of treatment for substance use disorders using a nationally representative sample of patients receiving treatment for psychoactive substance abuse and dependence in specialist treatment programs, regardless of funding source.  Outcomes monitoring involves assessment of participants functioning before, during, and following a specific intervention, without evaluation of the relative effectiveness of the particular intervention under consideration. NTOMS will build on the methodology already established through the Drug Evaluation Network System (DENS) and the Random Access Monitoring of Narcotic Addicts@ (RAMONA).  These systems were developed through ONDCP Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC) contracts and the components of these systems are in the public domain.  This contract will continue the process of conceptualizing and implementing NTOMS and RAMONA, adding to the instrumentation and software currently developed, and moving to full operation of the new surveillance system. 

NTOMS will collect data on an ongoing basis from a nationally representative sample of substance use disorder treatment providers in order to provide policy makers, the public, and treatment providers with a continuous source of information on treatment effectiveness.  NTOMS will provide the means for policy makers at all levels of government (Federal, State, and Local) and in the private sector to assess substance use disorder treatment outcomes on a national level.  NTOMS will provide a scientifically sound means for measuring progress in the treatment of one of the most significant chronic disease problems facing this country.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 1 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WALK-IN FREEZER DESIGNED WITH A BASE THAT IS AN INDEPENDENT LOAD SUPPORTING SYSTEM. MUST BE RATED FOR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT IN HOUSTON, TX.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted by potential offerors. 1) The first sentence of the specification indicates that the building will be used for the long-term temperature controlled storage of batteries.  What type of batteries (Lithium, Nicad, Lead Acid, etc.) will be stored inside the building?  Please advise. ANSWER) Li-ion and Li-MnO2 will be stored now, but many different chemistries will be used in the future. 2) If lead acid batteries will be stored inside the building, should the interior surfaces be resistant to sulfuric acid?  Please advise. ANSWER) No, we will accomplish this with trays and mats.  If this can be accomplished for the same price then it will be nice but not necessary. 3) Will battery charging or recovery operations be performed inside the building?  Please advise. ANSWER) No charging, the batteries will be pulled out of the freezer and tested. 4) Item 2.g. indicates that the walls, roof, and floor construction should be "...noncombustible...construction with material and design that are  to be for maximum...fire resistance...Metal sheets are to be used...." Although metal sheets are noncombustible and have some fire-resistance, they do not provide a fire rating.  Is this acceptable or should the walls, etc., incorporate a fire rated design?  If so, should they have a fire protection rating of 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, or 4-hour?  Please advise. ANSWER) No fire rating is required.   5) Item 2.g. indicates that "... pre-fabricated panels with mechanical fasteners (i.e., cam-lock panels) are acceptable for wall, roof, and floor construction.  If this is the case, it may not be possible to achieve a fire-rated construction.  Is fire-rated construction required? Please advise. ANSWER) No fire rating is required.   6) Items 2.g and 2.h indicate that the construction and interior finish is to be vapor tight.  Is the intent of this requirement to prevent the escape of vapors from the interior of the building to the outside through the walls, floor, and roof?  Or, is the concern to prevent vapors from escaping around the perimeter of each door?  In addition, what vapor or vapors will be present inside the building?  Please advise. ANSWER) The intent is to keep the moisture out.  There is no intent to have any vapors in the building. 7) Item 2.g indicates that metal skins be used in the construction of the storage building.  What is the minimum gauge of steel sheet that should be used?  Please advise. ANSWER) The worst-case scenario is a 1,000 lb cart with four wheels.   8)      Item 2.h states: "Interior Finish: Type 304 stainless steel...." What minimum gauge of 304 stainless steel sheets should be used to line the walls and ceiling?  Please advise. ANSWER) There will be no load on the walls.  Keep in mind the wind-loading and roof load specifications (See item 2e and 2f).   9) Item 2.h states: "Interior Finish: Type 304 stainless steel...." What gauge of 304 stainless steel sheet should be used to fabricate the floor?  (Please note: since this surface will be subject to foot traffic, light gauge material is assumed to be not acceptable).  Please advise. ANSWER) The worst-case scenario is a 1,000 lb cart with four wheels.   10) Should the building be equipped with a built-in secondary containment reservoir?  Please advise. ANSWER) No 11) Item 4c indicates that the door gaskets be provided with a vapor tight seal.  Should these gaskets be magnetic?  Please advise. ANSWER) The intent is to keep the moisture out.   12) Regarding item 5.a, please note that explosion-proof heated door seals are not available.  Since this will affect pricing for item 27 (Option 3), we recommend that Option 3 be amended to exclude the Class I, Group B, Division 1 requirement for the heated door seals.  Please advise. ANSWER) No, this is an optional requirement.  If the manufacturer cannot fulfill an individual optional requirement, then please still provide quote for meeting the basic requirements as well as any options that can be supported, clearly noting which options are not included in quote. 13) Regarding item 7.a, can the 6" diameter sampling port be a 6" x 6" square opening instead of a circular one?  Please advise.  ANSWER) That is acceptable.   14) Regarding item 7.a, does the removable cover need to be lockable?  Please advise. ANSWER)No 15) Regarding item 7.a, if fire-rated construction is required (please see question #4), then providing the sampling port through the door will negate the fire protection rating of the door.  Is this a concern?  Please advise. ANSWER) No fire rating is required.   16) Regarding item 7.b, will the 3/4" metal electrical conduit provided by others be rigid conduit or EMT conduit?  Please advise. ANSWER) Rigid conduit.   17) Figure 1 shows the location of the conditioning system on the roof of the building.  Instead of the roof location, can it be located through one of the walls?  Please advise. ANSWER) Anywhere is feasible as long as the basic inner and outer dimensions are meet.  See item 2a.    18) If the conditioning system must be located on the roof as depicted in Figure 1, does a ladder system or service stairway to the roof need to be provided?  Please advise. ANSWER) No, a ladder is not necessary and the conditioning system need not be on the roof.  See item 2a.   19) Is this a budgetary quote or is this a firm requirement? ANSWER) This is a firm requirement. 20) Can the proposal due date be extended? ANSWER) The proposal due date has been extended until March 8, 2002. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Proposals are due March 8, 2002. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

Is NASA open to all manufacturers, or are there any special requirements other than what is listed in the specs? Answer:  NASA prefer that the same company make both the software and hardware, so that there are no potential problems with incompatibility.   The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 03/08/02. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 2/14/02 Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

The short-listed A/E Firms/Lead Designers shall be required, in Stage II of the selection process, to demonstrate how this will be accomplished.  5% of the Stage II scoring will reflect how the A/E team meets this goal.

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 ?" x 11" format.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project). Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  

Submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Past Performance on Design (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) for five (5) new construction projects of similar size or complexity completed in the last ten (10) years.  Submittal of less than five (5) projects will result in a lower score.  If more than five projects are submitted, only the first five (5) will be considered.  Projects not completed within the last ten (10) years will not be considered.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues such as the integration of energy-conscious and low maintenance design features, and other parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the art courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment.  (3) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) Lead Designer Portfolio (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project, and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to five (5) new construction projects completed in the last ten (10) years.  SUBMITTAL OF LESS THAN FIVE (5) PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN A LOWER SCORE; IF MORE THAN FIVE PROJECTS ARE SUBMITTED, ONLY THE FIRST FIVE (5) WILL BE SCORED.  PROJECTS NOT COMPLETED WITHIN THE LAST TEN (10) YEARS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  
An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  

For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  A follow-up announcement shall be placed in this publication containing a list of the short-listed firms.  Each firm will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect their entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  Final selection will be based on evaluation of the Stage II submittals and each firm's interview.

The anticipated final A/E contract will include pre-design, schematic design, design development and construction document services.  The contract may include options for bidding services, tenant improvement services and construction contract administration services. Construction documents may require a single bid package, or multiple bid packages.  Construction may be achieved through Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc), also referred to as CM at risk.  The CMc will be involved in the design process, to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and constructability review.  The CMc will continue with construction by separately procuring contracts for construction.

Professional services include the preparation of working drawings and specifications and may require special services, such as: cost estimating, landscape/urban designer, interior design, acoustics, fire protection, security and detention systems design, and blast consultant.  In addition, special studies, reports, planning, programming services, on site surveys (including geotechnical surveys and analyses, topographical and boundary surveys), remediation studies, design and inspection of petroleum-impacted soils and other hazardous materials, value engineering services, construction of courtroom "mock-ups", construction observation services and other design and testing procedures that are common in the construction industry will be provided if so requested by the Government.  In addition, this building will be designed to meet the LEED Silver standard, or greater, as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council.  Where offerors propose in-house staff to provide special services, offerors should demonstrate that the qualifications of in-house personnel are equivalent to that of a consultant.  Inclusion of a "certified fire protection engineer" and a vertical transportation consultant on the Stage II design team is required.  The Lead Architectural Designer of the selected team will be involved in the selection of an artist and development of artwork as part of the Art-in-Architecture program.
Design shall be hard metric (System International - SI).  Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release.  Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated to AutoCAD are not acceptable.  Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards.  Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in native MSOffice 2000, latest release format.

Offerors must clearly indicate which AOR they are proposing:  SOUTHDIV under solicitation number N62467-01-R-0331 or LANTDIV under solicitation number N62470-02-R-3260.  Two separate contracts will be awarded: one for SOUTHDIV's AOR and another for LANTDIV's AOR.  This is not a multiple award contract and task orders will not be competed.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capability of any firms certified under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) program, to fulfill this requirement.   The EPA Office of Research and Development has a requirement for a contractor to provide technical support for the development of ecological risk assessment information, methods, models, and guidance. The Contractor shall conduct the research and development that is needed to develop ecological risk assessment methods and  develop ecological risk assessment guidance documents.   The scope of this requirement ranges from the creation of completely new assessment methods to the modification and adaption of existing assessment methods to meet specific needs.   The Contractor shall also prepare review drafts and final versions of the components of ecological risk assessments, e.g., planning and problem formulation, analysis of stressor-response, socio-economic impacts, and other related issues.  These products will be used by EPA to develop ecological risk assessment reports that discuss the nature and degree of hazard and risk posed to ecological resources.  The activities needed to accomplish this task include:  identifying the relevant scientific literature and computerized databases, including geographic information databases; reviewing the relevant literature and databases to determine useful existing information for the development of the assessment methods; synthesize existing information into summaries of the state of knowledge; writing draft assessment methods based on existing information sources and scientific judgement for review of the work assignment manager, clearly identifying which parts of the draft represent existing information and which parts represent judgement; making revisions to the draft as directed by the work assignment manager; and producing final ecological risk assessment methodology.  Ecological resources for which methods may be required include terrestrial systems, aquatic systems, combined aquatic and terrestrial systems, landscapes, and particular species of flora or fauna.   The contractor shall also organize and manage peer reviews of projects and reports.  These reviews must be performed by subject-matter experts in the area of ecology, and economics when socio-economic impacts of a risk assessment are requested.   The contractor shall provide technical, administrative and editorial assistance for the preparation of reports, briefing documents, fact sheets, and training materials on current and emerging ecological risk issues, including related socio-economic issues, and guidance topics.  This activity will require technical writing and editing, as well as preparation of graphics and audiovisual aids.  The Contractor shall organize and manage public meetings, conferences and forums.  Other required tasks include a requirement to develop an HTML, editor or other World Wide Web designer/hypertext applications editor to create interactive databases, and search engines or CD-ROMs, or expert systems for that specifically dealing with ecological risk assessment or causal evaluation for the transfer of information on ecological risk assessment that otherwise may not be available. It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Level of Effort contract and will have a base period with four (4) twelve month option periods.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6 million.  ANY 8(a) CERTIFIED FIRM should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors must indicate if they are a certified 8(a) firm.  Responses to the above should be submitted to the attention of Barbara Curtiss at curtiss.barbara@epa.gov no later than March 15, 2002.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is for information purposes only to seek potential small business sources in the 541611 NAICS, and is not a request for proposals.   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration?s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to handle a National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare which will implement a comprehensive program of information dissemination, knowledge application and technical assistance strategies to promote organizational and systems change at the national, state and local levels. The prime target audiences for this Center are Regional, State, and local child welfare and substance abuse agencies, including independent Tribal agencies and organizations.  As such the Center: 

?	Functions as the locus for the collection, dissemination and practical application, of the best available information on services and strategies for responding to the needs of families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;

?	Helps communities identify gaps in services and develop integrated approaches to respond more effectively to families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;

?	Convenes coalitions of policy makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers and family members from substance abuse and child welfare to define new directions and strategies;

?	Provides targeted technical assistance through the use of national and local experts, who assist communities that wish to implement interventions such as problem/risk identification, cross-training strategies, staff co-location, and unique judicial/court strategies (such as family drug courts.) 

In order to be successful in this endeavor, the Contractor will need to have very specialized knowledge about addiction treatment, the child welfare system, and judicial functions with regard to the handling of child abuse and neglect cases. As a result of a history of these sectors NOT working well together, it is essential that the Contractor have established credibility with the professionals from these sectors as a source for valued, useful, technical assistance and guidance on these and related topics.  In addition, the Contractor is expected to have the capacity to host a Website and coordinate logistics for a large number of meetings.  When taken together, specialized knowledge to deliver TA and training, computer technological capability, and multiple logistics coordination.

The accomplishment of these tasks in a cost effective manner will require the Contractor to devote substantial senior level management and program staff to this contract.  The Contractor will have to employ staff with a wide range of capabilities or have in place a management infrastructure which can efficiently manage subcontractors and/or consultants with those areas of expertise which the Contractor does not maintain in its full time staff.   

The Contractor will provide reviews of current literature of the subject of child welfare and substance abuse, as well as additional resources, including discussion from the field.  The Contractor will work with professional organizations representing both child welfare and substance abuse constituencies as part of the on-going assessment of need, will design and conduct the initial needs assessments and will refine and update annually. 

The Contractor will develop a plan using a wide range of information dissemination mechanisms to inform the target audiences about the National Center?s services, resources and products.  In addition, will conduct an on-going analysis to determine the effectiveness of the strategies used.

The Contractor will continually identify, review, analyze and distill information and resource materials for the target audiences.   This information will be collected in hard copy in a resource collection and will be recorded ina database that will be update regularly.  In addition, to the extent that the existing information and materials do not meet all of the information needs of the target audiences, the Contractor will develop new products to meet the needs.  The products will vary from fact sheets, brochures, program briefs, newsletters or monographs.  For any product that is approved, the Contractor shall develop and implement a product dissemination plan.

The Contractor shall design and develop a National Center web site to post information collected and developed.   The Contractor will prepare a self tutorial for the Center?s multiple target audiences to establish a baseline for knowledge on the subjects or substance abuse and child welfare and to motivate and facilitate cross systems work.

The Contractor will provide off site and on site technical assistance on a wide range of topics including strategic planning, values clarification, review of existing procedures and services, program implementation, communications protocols, cross systems training, client confidentiality rules, and data management.   In addition, the Contractor will provide a limited number of committed State child welfare and substance abuse entities will in-depth concentrated assistance aimed at improving systems for serving families.  The Contractor will support no more than 5 communities each year and will develop a protocol for identifying and prioritizing the communities.

The Contractor will organize a National Conference of approximately 400 persons, for child welfare, substance abuse, judicial and legislative audiences on policy, systems and practice issues.  The Contractor will be responsible for all planning, implementation and logistics associated with the conference.  The Contractor will also schedule three small meetings each year for either a speciality audience (i.e., Legislators, Native Americans, Rural or Regional), as a separate meeting, or as an add-on to existing meetings of the target audience.  Again the Contractor will be responsible for all planning, implementation and logistics associated with the conference.  In addition, the Contractor will prove staff or consultants to present at workshops at local, regional or national conferences on topics addressed by the National Center.  The Contractor will occasionally be asked to either make a presentation at a National, Regional or State meeting or to prepare a power point presentation for Federal staff.

Finally, the Contractor will establish a diverse National Expert Panel from the key disciplines to inform the development of guidelines and standards of practice for serving families in the child welfare system with substance abuse problems.



Successful offerors must demonstrate:  (1) A thorough  understanding of CSAT?s goals and objectives for assisting the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare in the activities mentioned above; specific approaches and potential problems and issues likely to be encountered in the development and implementation of the activities and potential solutions; (2) The availability of competent and experienced staff for the project.

Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBZone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. The North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) codes for this BAA is 54133 with the small business size of 1,500 employees. 
Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

(1)	VOLUME I ? TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed thirty (30) pages, should include the following three sections: Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD). 

(2)	VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 
Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors? cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 

VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The primary evaluation criteria are: 

(A)	Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

(B)	Potential contributions to the Avionics Group and the Electro-Optical and Special Missions Sensors Division to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for field-testing; (4) suitability for inclusion in a warfighting experiment (results of a simulation/study may be suitable for inclusion, but a contractor proposing paper vice hardware, needs to specifically address this evaluation factor); and, (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet or a commercial activity (for any developed hardware).

Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance than (A) and (B) but equal to each other, are:

(C)	The offeror?s capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and
(D)	The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. 


III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<SUBJECT>SPECIAL NOTICE - Alternate Financing for BPA
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE - This notice announces an opportunity for parties to submit Statements of Interest to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to participate in the financing of transmission infrastructure projects in the Pacific Northwest.  As the operator of three-quarters of the high-voltage transmission in the Pacific Northwest, the BPA has developed a transmission infrastructure proposal to address the most significant needs and to insure the continued reliability of the transmission system.  BPA will consider non-federal participation in eighteen different individual transmission lines or groups of transmission facilities that will allow BPA to:  Relieve constraints on the Northwest transmission grid, integrate new generation, continue to meet treaty obligations, and provide reliable transmission service in the region.  These eighteen projects are identified on the following website: http://www.transmission.bpa.gov/tbllib/Publications/Infrastructure/default_files /slide0001.htm .  BPA's Federal Treasury borrowing authority cap may not be sufficient to provide full capital funding for all of these transmission infrastructure projects.  BPA is therefore exploring additional approaches to capital funding of the projects.  The additional approaches include:  (1) actions that may be taken to optimize existing debt, and (2) non-federal financing or participation in individual projects or groups of projects. Interested parties should submit Statements of Interest that include the following:  (1) Name of submitting party and experience in financing electric utility transmission projects; (2) Name, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address of both management and technical points of contact; (3) Identity of the project(s) of interest and amount of financing the party is interested in contributing to the project(s); (4) Amount and type of revenue stream, return on investment, ownership, ownership-like interest, or other rights the party seeks in return for the party's participation; and (5) Description of the proposed participation in sufficient detail to enable BPA to evaluate the proposal.  BPA has developed principles for non-federal participation to make sure the interests of its customers, ratepayers and the Federal Government are adequately addressed, and to assure equity to all interests.  Therefore, BPA will entertain and evaluate Statements of Interest consistent with the following principles:  (1) The process is intended to obtain as much interest as possible in cost-effective non-federal participation and financing of transmission projects; (2) Non-federal participation may include ownership or ownership-like interests but will require complete control, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure assets by BPA; (3) Development of agreements for non-federal participation must not delay critical project completion; (4) This process should anticipate the rules being developed in FERC's NOPR process on integration of generation resources and take them into consideration; (5) Conditions of non-federal participation must be permissible under BPAT's OATT and existing statutory authority; (6) Risks incurred or avoided by BPA will be quantified to assess the total cost of any non-federal participation; (7) Adequate real property rights must be secured; (8) Any non-federal owned project must meet BPA's  system interconnection requirements; and (9) Mixed ownership of equipment within a substation, while not prohibited, is not favored.  Statements of Interest can be submitted by: (1) Mail to Robert C. Lahmann, Transmission Account Executive-TM/Ditt2, PO box 491, Vancouver, WA 98666-0491; (2) FAX to 360-418-8320; or (3) E-mail to rclahmann@bpa.gov.  All Statements of Interest must be received NOT LATER THAN Monday, April 15, 2002.  Point of Contact for this announcement is Robert C. Lahmann, telephone 360-418-2092; or email to rclahmann@bpa.gov .
