<CONTACT>Rebecca Vaughn, 256-895-1395
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama in support of the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), NY, intends to privatize its electric distribution system.  This privatization does not include the electric commodity and does not supplant e xisting commodity contracts.  Privatization is the transfer of ownership, which includes operation & maintenance, repair, improvements, etc. of Army owned systems to a non-Federal entity, and the subsequent acquisition of the utility distribution services from the new owners of the systems.  The Government will retain liability of any pre-existing environmental conditional conditions.  The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under10 U.S.C. 2688.  The conveyance will tr ansfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system.  The conveyance will not include any real property.  The contract for the acquisition of utility distribution services will be for a term of 5 0 years.    USMA’s electric distribution system is a modern, well-maintained system. Due to the large number of cadets and support staff, upgrades are frequently completed to maintain and meet state of the art education.  The local utility company enters the property at 2 locations with 35,000 volts and is then transformed to 13,800 volts and 4,160 volts. The transformation is accomplished by one (1) regulator station, four (4) primary substations, more than three dozen secondary substations and numerous transformers t hat deliver the power to the final user.  There are over 547,339 linear feet of underground primary cable and 150,660 linear feet of underground secondary cable.  These cables reach their destination through 439 manholes and 410,475 linear feet of mostly c oncrete encased duct.  There are 148,818 linear feet of overhead primary cable and 37,986 linear feet of overhead secondary cable.  The overhead has more than 303 utility poles with associated hardware.  There are over 1,099 street light standards and pole s that are a combination of a series of street lighting and multiple volt lighting with over 581,700 linear feet of underground overhead cable.  Many of the street light poles are specially cast structures.  Transformers number more than 200 and all oil fi lled transformers are tested every three years for PCB’s and other contaminants.  Preventive maintenance is performed regularly on all primary and secondary switching and all 100+ substation relays are tested yearly.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The RFP will be available during the March 2002 timeframe electronically through the Internet at www.hnd.usace.army.mil/contract.  The North American Inductry Classific ation System (NAICS) for this procurement is 221122.

They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andulucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract to install new windows in building 1301.  Contract magnitude is between $25,000 and $100,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contract administrator, scott.achin@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.

<DESC>This procurement is a design/build project for the repair of the water infiltration problem affecting the exterior curtain wall of the C. E. Chavez Memorial Building, Denver, Colorado.    This competitive procurement is unrestricted, open to both large and small business concerns that are specialists in external curtain wall design, construction, and/or repair.  The NAICS code is 235990 (Other Special Trade Contractors).  The anticipated magnitude of construction is between $250,000 and $500,000 (contingent upon the engineering report).  Bonding will be required for this project.  A site visit will be held to allow interested contractors to inspect the building.  The date of the site visit will be specified in the solicitation.   The government anticipates issuing the RFP by 2 January 2004.  The anticipated proposal due date is 2 February 2004 and the anticipated project completion date is August 2004.  The C. E. Chavez building is a 21 year-old structure with an elevation of 237 feet.  It has 9 floors plus two parapet elevations.  The building’s footprint is rectangular in shape with approximately 21,850 square feet.  The exterior curtain wall is a double layered system consisting of batt insulated dark green metal panels, one inch thick tinted glass, ¼ inch spandrel glass, red and green painted mullions, and weather proofing sealant.  The original metal panel system started to delaminate soon after it was built.  Another metal system has been installed over the existing system forming a double layer panel system.  The curtain wall has continuously leaked throughout the years.  In response to the leakage, the government has had the joints re-caulked, resulting iin sealing weep points thus inhibiting proper drainage.   We are seeking a contractor to repair the existing curtain wall damage, repair the damaged membrane around the parapet wall and correct the problem to prevent further damage.  This project will be advertised as a Request for Proposal.  Competitive proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the solicitation.   The company whose proposal provides the overall best value to the government will be awarded a firm-fixed priced contract.  Offeror’s must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award.  To register refer to the CCR Internet address : http://ww.ccr.gov.  It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any.

The Institute has been providing potential treatment drugs to investigators for use in preclinical toxicology evaluation, pharmacological studies and clinical trials.  The treatment drugs include both bulk drug substances (e.g., GBR-12909, tropane analogs, RPR 102681, etc.) and dosage forms (e.g., buprenorphine tablets, GBR-12909 capsules, RPR 102681 capsules, etc.).  These drugs are acquired by the Government from private industry, Government contractors/grantees or independent investigators. In order to assure the identity, strength, quality and purity of these materials, the Government has been performing quality control tests before distributing them to the research community.

NIDA anticipates award of a three?year incrementally funded completion?type contract with options for two additional years and additional quantities.

In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PC), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida 32407-7001  is the Systems Integration Agent (SIA), In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), Technical Support Activity (TSA) and Software Support Activity in support of the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation (C4N) program.  NSWC-PC intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Titan Corporation of San Diego, CA. for acquisition of the production of selected components for the LCAC SLEP Reliability Improvement Program (RIP) C4N System. This requirement is for acquisition of the following components required to improve the reliability of the LCAC C4N systems. The initial acquisition will be for four sets of the components with options for an additional nine sets for LCACs scheduled for the Service Life Extension Progra m (SLEP) and options for seven back fit kits for LCACs that have already completed the SLEP. The components are: a. Integrated UKB Computer systems (one per set) b. Integrated Navigation Computer systems (one per set) c. Integrated IP based Common Data recorder (CDR) Computer systems (one per set)  d. Ethernet Network Switch Units (two per set) This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  a. These components were uniquely designed by Titan Corporation for the LCAC C4N RIP and are not commercially available. Titan Corporation also built the first prototypes for testing. The prototype RIP hardware has undergone environmental qualification testing (EQT) in the 1st Qtr of FY04 and Titan is currently refining the design based on the results of these tests. b. The LCAC Navigation (NAV) System RIP processing unit, Universal Ke yboard System RIP processing unit, the Control & Alarm Monitoring System (CAMS) Video Switch RIP equipment, LCAC Common Data Recorder RIP and the LCAC Ethernet Switch Assembly being procured are required to be compatible with existing LCAC equipment.  The RIP equipment specified above is 100% compatible with the existing LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) equipment with the transition from FDDI to Ethernet.  Software (embedded operating systems, operational flight software and offline diagnostics) has been developed and tested with the new RIP hardware configuration.  Maintenance and operator training have also been developed for the LCAC C4N RIP configuration as well.  Technical manual updates are being performed to match the new RIP hardware configuration.    Therefore it is in the Government’s best interest to purchase the equipment from Titan Corporation that will a llow for re-use of the developed software, training and qualified hardware as well as being compatible with other existing C4N equipment. c. While drawings were developed for the equipment they are insufficiently detailed at this point to support competitive acquisition of the components.  d. This is a direct follow-on to efforts conducted under contracts N61331-98-D-0002 and N61331-03-D-0001 for highly unique components of a complex system within the meaning of FAR 6.301(a)(ii).   Given Titan Corporations intimate and detailed knowledge of the design of these components it is unlikely that any other vendor could overcome the learning curve required to be cost effective.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source contract to American Underwater Products, Inc. (Oceanic), 2002 Davis Street, San Leandro, CA 94577-1211 for the development, fabrication, testing, and delivery of 15 pre-production Combatant Diver Display Masks (CDDM).  Only Oceanic can fulfill this requirement for the following reasons:  The program was started in 1997 as an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) to help solve the problem of divers not being able to see critical dive information (depth, bottom time, bottle pressure) under the adverse conditions of poor or zero visibility.   The program goal was to demonstrate the concept of a mask integrated optical system that would provide a diver with a hands-free way to readily see this information, simultaneously displayed in a single location (versus on multiple individual gaug es), under adverse visibility conditions.  On June 5th, 1998, Oceanic entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NSWC-PC for the joint development of a prototype IDDM.  The designs developed during the CRADA period and a number of Oceanic proprietary electronic components were subsequently used by the Naval Surface Warfare Center to build a number of prototype IDDMs.  Only Oceanic, which has the proprietary electronic components and designs, can provide a production version of the IDDM, namely the CDDM.  NAICS Code 339920 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is 4220.

<DESC>NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION DIRECTORATE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTERNET PRIORITY SERVICE (IPS) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Scope The National Communications System (NCS) of the Department of Homeland Security is soliciting information regarding assured communications through the Internet. This information is with respect to services or products that carriers, vendors, and third parties can provide, or plan in the future to provide, applicable to designing/developing an Internet Priority Service (IPS) capability to support national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) communications. This request for information (RFI) seeks technical information regarding Internet-based assured communications for data, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Responses from all organizations including commercial entities, academic institutions, and Government departments and agencies, are encouraged. 1.2 Background Under the provisions of Executive Order 12472, the NCS is responsible for ensuring that an NS/EP telecommunications infrastructure exists and is responsive to the needs of the President and the Federal departments and agencies using public and private telecommunications systems. In support of this mission, we have initiated several programs designed to overcome network failure and congestion during emergency situations, including the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP), and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) to address priority services for Federal, State, and local Critical Infrastructure leadership personnel during an emergency. The current implementations of priority service for NS/EP telecommunications consist of voice and voice-band data only in the circuit switched wire-line and wireless networks. Due to the ever-increasing use of the Internet for transmission of all types of communications, we are looking at ways to provide similar types of assured communications for data applications and voice or video applications running over the Internet. Information learned from this RFI will be used to help NCS achieve the following goals: ? Identify plans and emerging technologies for providing priority services through the Internet. ? Accelerate promising technologies by prototyping and proof-of-concept projects. ? Promote industry wide adoption of these technologies through the industry standardization process ? Model technologies to determine what enhancements (if any) are required to meet the stringent NS/EP requirements. ? Enable the NCS?s IPS to leverage and enhance future commercial priority service capabilities. 2. AREAS OF INTEREST The following functional goals of an IPS concept should be considered: Enhanced Priority Treatment Secure Networks Ubiquitous Coverage International Connectivity Interoperable Scalable Bandwidth Mobility Voice Band Service Broadband Service Reliability/Availability Restorable Survivable Non-Traceable Affordable Ultimately, the service should be resilient to large-scale outages of the Internet infrastructure in addition to outages of other infrastructures the Internet is dependent upon-such as electric power and telecommunications. It should also be resilient to cyber attacks originating within the Internet itself, such as denial of service, worms, etc. Solutions should have ubiquitous coverage in that they translate to various physical and link layer technologies, locations, applications, and network topologies. Specifically, we are looking for solutions that will provide end-to-end priority in inter-Autonomous Systems (AS) cross-provider environments, as well as within single provider networks. To enable interoperability, we have IPS standards efforts underway; however, a lack of standards should not preclude a response--we are also interested in concepts and implementations that may be proprietary in nature, and have not yet been standardized. Responders are encouraged to review the T1A1.2 committee?s ?Roadmap Standards in Support of Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS)? under the project T1A1-19 ?Reliability/Availability of IP-based Networks and Services,? whose concepts are reflected throughout this RFI. An IPS should have a large set of capabilities to potentially be of service during disaster recovery activities. Since not all of the following features are currently available, responses are not expected to meet all of these criteria; however, IPS features and objectives could include the following: ? Multimedia and telephony services ? Rapid user authentication ? Security protection of user traffic ? Preferential access to telecomm facilities ? Preferential establishment of communications ? Preferential routing of traffic ? Preferential use of remaining operational resources ? Preferential completion of user traffic to destination ? Allowable degradation of service quality ? Interchange of critical telecomm service management information ? Optional preemption of non-emergency traffic (where permitted by regulation) The objective is to provide priority service for Internet applications critical to essential personnel during a crisis. Preliminary analysis shows that numerous approaches are possible due to the design of the protocol model and state that makes up the Internet; however, prioritized delivery of individual packets at the lower layers of the Internet protocol model does not guarantee that transactions will gain priority processing on end systems and servers. Since any single protocol is likely to be insufficient to guarantee priority, several approaches may need to be combined to form an operational system. In addition to end-to-end solutions, we are interested in individual submissions that may consist of building blocks for an overall IPS architecture. Responses should address how these building blocks fit within the traditional Internet model to eventually provide an end-to-end solution. Specifically, the following areas should be addressed: ? Link Layer. A large variety of layer 2 link level technologies are incorporated within the Internet. Enhancements applicable to priority services for High-speed optical backbone technologies such as SONET, Packet over SONET, MPLS, Gigabit Ethernet, DWDM, and ATM are of interest. Also of interest are enhancements applicable to access technologies such as DSL, cable modem, and fixed wireless, in addition to priority within mobile wireless protocols such as messaging, 3G cellular data, and satellite data. ? Network Layer. Internet Protocol (IP) makes up the entire network layer for the Internet. There are two versions of IP applicable to this RFI. IP Version 4 is the current protocol that operates the majority of the Internet. IP v6 will eventually replace IP v4, with superior addressing, security, priority and other features. We are interested in approaches that are applicable to either or both versions of IP. ? Transport Layer. Protocols designed to assure data transmission end-to-end or hop-by-hop through the Internet often are considered transport layer enhancements. The IETF has standardized a number of approaches, so implementations of these are of interest to us. Additional concepts and proprietary implementations in this area are also of interest. ? Application Layer. Applications control the Internet; as an example BGP and DNS are applications that are considered core infrastructure pieces of the Internet. Applications also make up the services that utilize the Internet. Of interest are application enhancements that will lead to one or more of the fourteen functional goals for an assured IPS. Applications of particular interest include (but are not limited to) email, messaging, web, VoIP, (transport and edge), and video. ? Standards and APIs. We are also interested in standards or APIs that have been developed in these areas, whether or not implemented in products or services. 3. RESPONSE GUIDELINES 3.1 Scope Most organizations do not have expertise or capabilities in all of the areas described above; therefore, responses addressing only a subset of or single identified area(s) of interest are also welcome. Responses should be clearly labeled with the areas of interest that are discussed. Length of responses should be limited to no more than 40 pages. 3.2 Structure Provide any materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate. In addition, please provide ample contact information, including telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, to facilitate any needed clarification or further discussion. Include, as appropriate, the following: ? Description of Products/Technologies/Research/Standards/APIs, including performance information ? Plans for commercial use of these technologies ? Corporate partners who will use the technology ? Feasibility Assessment ? Cost and Schedule Estimates ? Existing Government Contracts ? Corporate Expertise 3.3 Format Electronic and hard copy formats are both acceptable, although electronic submission is preferred. If provided electronically, submissions should be in a Microsoft Office compatible format or Adobe Acrobat. Copies may be emailed to Mr. Dave Nolan at noland@ncs.gov or mailed to the address below. 3.4 Deadline Responses are due 60 days after release of this RFI. 4. DISCLAIMER There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or a contract awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. 5. CONTACT INFORMATION Mr. David J.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation,  No. RFQ-NCI-40019-NV will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-18.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized in FAR 13.6.

 The solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 and the business size standard is 6 million dollars.  

REQUIREMENT:	Sieving and Storage of Carpet Dust Samples

A.  Background Information

The Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is conducting a case-control study of breast cancer in Poland [contracts N01-CP-91013, N02-CP-11003.] As part of this study, used vacuum cleaner bags were collected from 1,611 study participants.   

The vacuum bags were stored in freezers at -45 degrees C in Poland.  About four to five days before being shipped to the U.S., the bags were taken out of the freezer and kept in shipping boxes at room temperature.  They were then shipped to a repository in Frederick, Maryland, where they are being stored at room temperature in herbarium (sealed) cabinets.  Herbarium cabinets are being used because six samples have been observed to be infested with larvae and/or insects.  The samples are not inspected routinely, and it is possible that more bags are infested.

B.  Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement

The purpose of this task is to sieve and store the dust samples.  The samples will eventually be analyzed for metals and other substances, but analysis of the dust samples is not covered under this task.

C.  Contract Requirements 

All of the vacuum bags will be available for shipment to the Contractor on the effective date of this procurement.  In the proposal, the Offeror shall describe the desired schedule for receiving  the samples, and shall use this schedule as the basis for the cost proposal.  The Contractor shall receipt and log in the vacuum bags.  The Contractor shall split the bags and remove portions of dust from four to six different areas of the bag, including areas near the center and bag walls of the upper, middle, and lower portions of the bag.  The sampled material shall be sieved through a 140-150 um stainless steel sieve to separate the dust into fine and coarse fractions.  A sufficient amount of dust shall be sieved to yield 20g of fine dust (if available) for storage.  The coarse fraction may be discarded, along with the vacuum bag and its remaining contents.  The fine fraction shall be weighed and the weight of each sample shall be recorded in the dust log, along with the date the sample was sieved and the initials of the person performing the sieving.  During lag periods between the different stages of sample receipt and processing, the samples may be stored either at room temperature or in freezers, at the discretion of the Contractor.  

NCI is considering two options for storing the sieved samples: (1) frozen and (2) room temperature.  In the proposal, the Offeror shall provide costs for each of these two options. 

Sieving shall be completed within eight months of the effective date of the contract.  We currently anticipate storage of  the samples for 1½ years after the last sample is sieved.  At the end of the contract period, the samples shall be shipped to a laboratory specified by NCI.

D.  Government Responsibilities

The Government will provide the Contractor with approximately 1,611 used vacuum cleaner bags. 

E.  Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

The Contractor shall send an electronic version of the dust log to NCI on a monthly basis.  At the end of the performance period, the Contractor shall ship all of the processed dust samples to a laboratory to be named by NCI.

F.  Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

The dust logs will be inspected by the NCI-OEEB researchers who will judge the acceptability of the work.


EVALUATION CRITERIA:

The technical portion of quotations will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make award to the vendor whose offer provides the greatest overall value to the Government. 

Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria: 
	

Technical Approach - 40 points

1.	Adequacy and feasibility of the proposed methods and plans for processing and storing the dust samples, including quality control procedures for preventing cross contamination of the samples

2.	Adequacy of plans for receipting, logging, and tracking the dust samples

Experience - 30 points

3.	Experience of key personnel in processing carpet dust samples for epidemiologic studies. 

Facilities - 30 points

1.	Adequacy and availability of suitable facilities and equipment to perform all of the items in the statement of work.   

Offerors must provide a proposal, any descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other materials that demonstrate that their offer meets the foregoing requirements.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Big Sky Laser/Quantel (Bozeman, MT) under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for the purchase of a Brilliant Pulsed Nd;YAG Laser System with high energy THG package and rack mounted power supply. EPA has determined that the Brilliant Laser system is the only known laser on the market that has a high enough power rating (355 nm) that can supply energy at a specific wavelength to allow for ionization functions. Moreover, its compact size and rack mounted power supply are essential because the instrument will be  used in field studies, which requires mobility.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates Big Sky Laser is the only source able to satisfy the Government's requirements. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical  documentation to establish the potential of offering an equivalent laser.  Such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is  334516. The anticipated award date is 12/20/03. Interested parties should submit documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: by fax to 513.487.2109, or by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-04-00029.

<DESC>PRDA 04-01-IFKA PART 1 OF 2.  Points of Contact: Dr. Reggie Brothers, DARPA Program Manager, (703) 696-2373, email rbrothers@darpa.mil; Mr. Robert J. Denton, Jr., AFRL Program Manager, (315) 330-7067, email robert.denton@rl.af.mil; Ms. Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, (315) 330-4777, email renee.arcuri@rl.af.mil.  REFERENCE: DoD "Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook", issued by DUSD(S&T) in September 2003.  May be accessed by going to the following Web address:http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html, then scrolling down to PRDA 04-01-IFKA.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate, Radar Technology Branch are seeking firms with directly related experience and qualifications to continue the research and development of innovative passive concepts and techniques for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), which was pursued during Phase 1 of the SYCO Program.  Background:  Recent experiences in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia, and Kosovo have called attention to the need for improved situational awareness for the planning and conduct of military operations.  Future military operations will increasingly rely on accurate, persistent Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB)/Common Relevant Operational Picture (CROP), available in a timely manner, day or night and during all weather conditions.  Both products need knowledge and information derived from Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar detections, High Resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (HRSAR) imagery and precise High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI), all accurately geo-registered.  As the Department of the Defense transforms to Network Centric Warfare, GMTI, HRSAR and/or HRTI may be provided to tactical forces directly, for precision targeting and weapons delivery.  In this situation, passive radar operation (as provided by the SYCO concept) affords significant platform-survival and mission-covertness advantage in operations behind the lines.  For GMTI detection, persistent surveillance is required to effectively monitor and track the intermittent movements of targets of high interest, especially behind enemy lines.  Likewise, excellent quality HRSAR is needed on demand to provide recognition and categorization of stationary targets, for effective identification and weapons targeting.  Program Objectives:  The objective of the DARPA/AFRL Phase 2 Symbiotic Communications (SYCO) program is to develop an advanced airborne passive flight demonstration Breadboard or flight demonstration Prototype system that is capable of creating GMTI, HRSAR and HRTI using a specific uncooperative transmitter source.  If the program continues beyond the Phase 2 Critical Design Review (CDR), then either a Breadboard or a Prototype flight demonstration system will be developed and demonstrated in Phase 2, depending on the contract option selected at CDR. The flight demonstration system is aimed at advancing the Technical Readiness Level of SYCO technology, which will subsequently be assessed within the framework mandated in the REFERENCE "Deskbook", which is posted on the SYCO PRDA website.  Such assessments are used by DoD to determine the readiness of technology for transition to Acquisition programs.  This flight demonstration system will be a multi-mode passive, bistatic radar capable of creating GMTI, HRSAR and HTTI products in adverse-weather, day/night operation. The desired capabilities of the flight demonstration system include, but are not limited to: [1] GMTI detection and tracking of moving ground targets (including dismounted troops); [2] HRSAR detection and geolocation of stationary military targets; [3] robust and reliable HRTI (relative and absolute accuracy and precision commensurate with NIMA defined Level 4, with a stretch goal of Level 5; [4] automated terrain categorization that can differentiate between wet versus dry ground (for trafficability estimation), and distinguish grass versus brush versus substantial trees; and [5] real time operation and data processing, if the Prototype option is selected.  More detailed background and objectives information for SYCO Phase 2 is provided in the Classified Annex to this PRDA, which also provides the specific technical performance thresholds and goals for the effort.  This Classified Annex is SECRET, and may be requested by qualified organizations possessing a current SECRET facility clearance from Mr. Robert J. Denton, Jr., AFRL Program Manager for SYCO, (315) 330-7067, email robert.denton@rl.af.mil.  The security classification guidance for SYCO is embodied in the DARPA SYCO Security Classification Guide (CG-210 dated 15 February 2001), which is also included in this classified CD.  In addition, all questions and answers discussed during Industry Day will also be included.  Questions submitted after Industry Day are strongly encouraged to be submitted NLT 31 Dec 2003 in order to disseminate prior to proposal submission.  Questions should be transmitted to Mr. Robert J. Denton, Jr., AFRL Program Manager for SYCO, email robert.denton@rl.af.mil, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri at Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  Definitions: For purposes of this PRDA, the flight demonstration Breadboard and flight demonstration Prototype options are defined specifically as follows, consistent with the general concepts explained in the REFERENCE "Deskbook":  [1] Flight Demonstration Breadboard:  If the Government elects to continue the baseline effort at the time of CDR, the flight demonstration system will be developed and tested to provide Breadboard validation of the system.  This implies that the basic technology will be integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements in an airborne testbed environment.  The equipment will not embody the weight, volume, power, thermal, form and fit requirements of the objective platform, and will not address real-time radar data processing.  Certification testing will consider the thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments of the test platform only, not those of the objective platform.  Associated system software will likewise conform to Breadboard software readiness level, which implies "alpha" version software, running on processors with characteristics expected in the operational environment.  The contractor will initiate configuration control, and verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A), of the integrated flight system software.  [2] Flight Demonstration Prototype: If the Government elects to exercise the alternative option at the time of CDR, the flight demonstration system will be developed and tested to provide a Prototype validation of the system in an airborne testbed environment.  This option will include more detailed component testing, real time radar data processing and exploitation, airborne experimentation and validation, and participation in one field exercise, or demonstration, with Users.  Under this option, the flight system equipment will be designed, developed and tested to meet the weight, volume, power, thermal, form, fit and function requirements of an objective platform to be selected by the Government.  For planning and proposal purposes, the offerer should consider a large heavy-lift objective platform such as a C-130, Gulfstream G-4 or a rotary-wing platform such as an A-160.  Similarly, associated Prototype system software will conform to prototype standards, which implies "beta" version software, running on processors with characteristics expected in the operational environment.  The contractor will pursue configuration control, and verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A), of the integrated flight system software.  Program Approach:  SYCO Phase 1 was a design competition performed by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (formerly Veridian) and Sandia National Laboratory.  The Phase 2 effort will build upon the achievements of Phase 1 and address the Program Objectives identified above, by focusing on the development, characterization and demonstration of an integrated airborne SYCO flight system.  This effort will be contracted as a baseline flight demonstration Breadboard development effort, with a costed option for a flight demonstration Prototype post-CDR effort.  The contractor will address both Breadboard and Prototype designs through CDR.  The Prototype option, if elected, will be exercised at the Government GO/NO-GO Decision scheduled at CDR. The Prototype decision will be based on DARPA’s success in arranging internal Government agreements with a Military Service or Other Government Agency transition partner, for the transition of SYCO technologies to an operational application.  This operational application’s objective platform characteristics will determine the form and fit requirements for the Prototype.  The proposed program must be structured to allow either a Breadboard or Prototype development to proceed seamlessly after CDR, with no schedule interruption, no matter what decision is made.  As such, an option for the continued breadboard development after CDR, and an option for the prototype after CDR must be proposed.  Based on the number of proposals submitted, up to two contractor teams will compete in Phase 2 up to CDR. At CDR, a government GO/NO-GO Decision will be made to continue the program based on results accomplished by CDR, and if two teams are competing, a down selection will be made to continue a single contractor for either the baseline Breadboard program, or elect the Prototype option if a Government transition partner has been identified.  The Phase 2 contractor will [1] rapidly develop the critical elements, including algorithms, software, and hardware components required by the SYCO concept, and integrate them into the airborne flight system, within the time-critical completion schedule and [2] proceed in a timely manner to execute and complete the SYCO flight system test and demonstration program.  Critical milestones are:  •Estimated Phase 2 award date: 01 April 2004; •Successful Preliminary Design Review (PDR) on/before 01 May 2004; •Demonstrate Automated HRTI 4 production in the laboratory: 4Q-FY04; •	Critical Design Review (CDR): 1Q-FY05; •GO/NO-GO Decision (and Breadboard vs. Prototype flight system selection): 1Q-FY05;
•Complete integrated flight system: -For Breadboard base system: 3Q-FY05; -For Prototype option: 4Q-FY05; •Begin airborne experiments and demonstrations: -For Breadboard base system: 3Q-FY05; -For Prototype option: 4Q-FY05; •Demonstrate long-dwell GMTI: -For Breadboard base system: 4Q-FY05; -For Prototype option: 2Q-FY06; •Demonstrate airborne HRTI 4 production (with a stretch goal of Level 5): -For Breadboard base system: 3Q-FY05; -Real-time For Prototype option: 1Q-FY06; •Conduct limited user testing (Prototype option only): 3Q-FY06 through 4Q-FY06  (Can be negotiated based on Service Partner’s desires); •Phase 2 complete:  -For Breadboard base system: 4Q-FY05;  -For Prototype option: 4Q-FY06.  The key aim of the flight system is to facilitate transfer of SYCO technology to military systems. The contractor will support the Government during the pre-CDR phase with user requirement analyses, data analysis and concept design studies, to address Service requirements and identification of future way ahead, e.g., transition to a Service Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) as a stepping stone to System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  Specific attention will be given to assessments of the various target location errors (TLE), and system concepts for meeting Service TLE requirements.  Specific attention will also be given to applications of coherent, non-coherent and polarimetric change detection technology to SYCO system design.  Offerer Qualifications:  As noted above, the SYCO Phase 2 PRDA competition is open to all qualified bidders.   The Government is looking for contractor teams who can show recent direct experience in the airborne bistatic collection and exploitation of SYCO signal sources discussed in the classified annex to produce accurate and robust SAR, HRTI, and GMTI products.  The team capabilities and experience should include (but not necessarily be limited to) the following:   1. Experience producing high-resolution (at least HRTI Level 4) IFSAR imagery to enhance targeting of high-precision weapons.  2. Experience utilizing exo-/endo-clutter approaches to achieve GMTI acquisition and tracking of multiple ground targets.  3. Experience exploiting polarimetric, high-resolution SAR and IFSAR to provide terrain categorization maps that are useful in determining trafficability and foliage coverage.  4. Experience developing real-time airborne hardware and software to Breadboard and Prototype standards as defined above, including real-time on-board radar signal processing, exploitation and reporting capabilities.  5.  Experience developing an integrated system concept to produce and deliver quality real-time HRTI and GMTI products (as well as HRTI SAR-sub-mode products).  6. Experience planning and executing successful airborne radar test programs, and support of limited user testing.  7. Current possession and ability to provide significant testbed equipment to implement the flight system.  8. Processes currently in place to perform software configuration control and verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) to the level required for Breadboard and Prototype standards as defined above. 9. Capable of conducting SDD and manufacturing of the flight system if the costed Prototype option is exercised.  10. Work to be performed will require SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Therefore, personnel identified for assignment to this effort and facilities proposed must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award.  Qualified bidders must currently possess sufficient SECRET level cleared facilities and personnel to execute the program.  CONTINUED AT PRDA 04-01-IFKA PART 2 OF 2.

<DESC>PRDA 04-01-IFKA.  PART 2 OF 2.  11. In order to ensure a stable Phase 2 program, the Government intends to make a Key Personnel Clause a part of the contract.  Proposals must stipulate the contractor’s willingness to accept such a clause.   PRDA Goals and Task Efforts:  The purpose of this SYCO PRDA is to enable the Government to select a best-in-class Phase 2 team, which is optimally suited to build upon the research results and proof-of-concept demonstrations achieved in Phase 1, and offers an outstanding proposal for Phase 2 development and operation of the SYCO flight system.  This Phase 2 PRDA is intended to result in one or more baseline awards funded in two parts over a period of performance of approximately 18 to 30 months, with the entire program totaling approximately $20 million if the costed Prototype option is exercised.  The pre-CDR activities involve objective concept development and transition activities, system trade studies, risk mitigation activities and automated demonstration of HRTI/NIMA Level 4.  It is anticipated that this portion of Phase 2 program will involve up to two contractor teams competing, with each incrementally funded at not more than $3.5 million.  After CDR, the continuing contractor team is anticipated to be able to complete the baseline Breadboard effort for not more than an additional $4 million (for a team total of not more than $7.5 million).  However if the Prototype option is exercised at CDR, the continuing contractor team will instead receive additional funding of not more than $13 million, to execute the Prototype option portion of Phase 2 (for a team total of not more than $16.5 million).  An award is expected on or before 01 April 2004. The technical activities necessary for the period of performance of the anticipated award will include, but are not limited to, the following Tasks:  1. Design Studies.  The contractor will conduct design studies, data analyses and system trade studies to refine and assess alternative SYCO system concepts including alternative potential signal sources (refer to the Classified Annex) and developing performance predictions.  These efforts will focus on the design of a SYCO flight system and will include a Preliminary Design Review on or before 01 May 2004, and a Critical Design Review (CDR) in 1Q-FY05.  Both Breadboard and Prototype designs will be carried through CDR.  At the CDR, the Government will have an opportunity to review and approve the final flight system design.  As explained above, at the time of CDR, the Government will make a GO/NO-GO decision on whether to proceed further with Phase 2.  If the decision is positive, the Government will further decide whether to continue the baseline Breadboard flight system, or exercise the Prototype option augmentation effort.  The flight system design effort will make maximum use of existing/emerging sensor and platform technologies with minimum necessary requirements for SYCO-specific modifications or upgrades.  To the maximum possible extent, SYCO Phase 2 will exploit existing equipment and technology developed under Phase 1, or equivalent equipment and technology available to the contractor. For the Prototype option the flight system design should implement an end-to-end collection, processing, exploitation, analysis and product delivery architecture and capability.  GMTI target location methodology and real time data delivery are key factors for demonstrations.  Consequently, for Prototype manned-platform implementations, serious design consideration should be given to on-board display, exploitation, analysis and product editing capabilities.  Design efforts should optimize the military utility and product delivery timelines available within the context of voice communications and a voice and data downlink to the flight system ground segment. 2. Risk Mitigation.  Based on the results of the PDR and Phase 1, the contractor will conduct those pre-CDR risk mitigation, or component/subsystem engineering, activities necessary to have a credible CDR for the flight system development.  The work should be encompassing enough that it provides risk mitigation no matter which follow-on activity is chosen.  3. Development.  Following flight system design approval at CDR, the contractor will proceed to develop, implement, test, characterize and operate the flight system utilizing the selected signal source.  This effort will be scheduled and accomplished so that the flight system is available for airborne characterization experiments, demonstrations and (for the Prototype option) limited user testing beginning in 3Q-FY06.  4. Test planning.  The contractor will develop a technical Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and implementation and test plan for the flight system, including characterization and calibration.  The contractor will propose specific collection campaigns to be carried out for purposes of characterizing flight system performance, demonstrating system goals and gathering additional information necessary to prove the feasibility of an operational system.  5. Demonstrations.  The contractor will demonstrate HRSAR and Level 4 HRTI processing of flight data; demonstrate change detection performance; demonstrate GMTI detection and tracking of multiple targets over long dwells (more than 30 seconds); assess single-platform target location error (TLE) capability; model and estimate multi-platform TLE performance.  As a part of this task, the contractor will:  •Demonstrate flight system real-time operation and data delivery (Prototype option only).  -	Maintain and document configuration control over the flight system.  - Demonstrate a preliminary terrain classification capability.  - Develop a preliminary flight system Mission Planning capability and participate in limited user testing (Prototype option only).  6. Limited User Testing.  If the Government selects the Prototype flight system option, limited user testing will be conducted.  For proposal purposes, the requirements for military-scenario demonstrations and limited user tests are as follows: [a] The CONOPS will be consistent with the requirements and user input.  Example scenarios include intelligence preparation of the battlefield/common relevant operational picture, change detection, and GMTI tracking.  The offerer is required to recommend candidate scenarios. [b] Final demonstration requirements, operations areas, range services, site coordination, and target vehicles will be GFE.  Candidate operations areas will be relevant to the identified Service partner.  [c] The nominal demonstrations will consist of at least 12 flights made up of at least 6 3-day events with at least 2 flights per event and a total number of not more than 60 flight hours.  The events may be spaced apart by several days.  7. Application Studies.  Under Government supervision and control, the contractor will interact with potential Users to facilitate a successful transition to an objective system, and assist DARPA and AFRL in developing a preliminary Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for achieving transition and POM funding for further development, i.e., SDD, of the SYCO capability.  This may include developing military CONOPS, Mission Planning Architecture, and preliminary design and implementation plan, and transition plan for the integration of a SYCO sensor and communications relay suite onto candidate operational airborne platforms.  It also may include assisting DARPA/AFRL in preparing for and successfully concluding negotiations for the MOA for the transition and funding of the SYCO capability to an operational system.  The contractor’s effort shall include, but not limited to, the refinement of system concepts and development of cost estimates for the selected operational architecture.  The flight system must achieve the performance thresholds identified in the Classified Annex to this PRDA document, and in their proposal the Offerers must show by analysis and/or experimental data that the Phase 2 goals are achievable using their proposed flight system approach.  In addition, the Offerer must identify critical technologies and key challenges and provide details of candidate algorithms/techniques. Simple and innovative solutions are encouraged.  However, the primary objective of Phase 2 is to further develop, refine and improve upon the baseline system concept and Concept of Operations examined during Phase 1 as well as demonstrated capability in a military-like scenario.  Program Reviews:  The Government will review the Phase 2 contractor’s efforts at Quarterly Program Reviews (QPRs).  There will be a Kickoff meeting in the first month after award of contract, to discuss the contractor’s detailed program plan.  A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) will be held as early in Phase 2 as possible, with a goal of having a successful PDR no later that 01 May 2004.  Additionally, during the flight system design effort, the Government will hold a Critical Design Review (CDR) in 1Q-FY05.  QPRs will be conducted to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk through the life of the program.  At the CDR the Government will review, assess and approve the flight system final design.  Additional technical meetings (including software readiness reviews, test planning and flight readiness reviews) will be conducted as required for coordination, planning and progress assessment. Program Deliverables:  Program deliverables will include but will not be limited to:  (a) A draft Preliminary Design Document (PDD) will be submitted at the PDR (01 May 2004), and the final PDD will be due 30 days after the Government review of the draft is complete. The PDD will describe the flight system concept, CONOPS and performance requirements, processing algorithm designs and projected system airborne collection performance. The PDD should include detailed descriptions of algorithm designs for all supported processing modes including, but not limited to, IFSAR processing, HRTI processing , HSAR processing, GMTI processing and automated mission planning.  The PDD should also cover preliminary design assessments for the product generation, exploitation and distribution architecture, including the on-board display, analysis and product editing capabilities, which will be coupled via voice communications and a voice and data downlink to the flight system ground segment for final product/information distribution. The PDD should expand upon the results of the experiments and analyses carried out in Phase 1.  It should also include estimates of interim performance metrics for all supported modes. It should include other results as appropriate, including target location concepts and TLE estimates. The PDD must include a WBS for the final flight system build.  (b) Critical Design Document (CDD) that describes in detail the flight system hardware, processing algorithm, software and communications link designs.  The draft CDD will be due at the Phase 2 CDR (1Q-FY05) and the final CDD will be due 30 days after the Government review of the draft is complete.
(c) SYCO Performance Analysis Report that summarizes the results of continuing measurements and analyses and their potential impact on the long-range SYCO operational system will be due at the conclusion of Phase 2.  (d) Data Processing Report providing data and results for all supported modes sufficient to enable independent Government assessment of system performance results is due by the end of contract for the base system (Q4-FY05) and before user testing for the PROTOTYPE/PROTOTYPE option (approximately Q2-FY06).  (e) Phase 2 SYCO Final Report (SFR) that summarizes the results of all Phase 2 activities, including a proposed CONOP and transition plan for an operational system is due at the conclusion of Phase 2.  It will include a design documentation package, documenting the final configuration of the flight system hardware and software, and reporting the final software configuration control and verification, validation and accreditation status.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The IPP scope of work (SOW) is anticipated to provide for several functional areas, including:  Management, planning, and responsibilit y for total systems performance of each installation's CBRN design; Development of the Systems Architecture and requisite systems specifications required for the IPP to produce the capabilities documented in the Urgent Requirements Capabilities Document (U RCD) and Initial Systems Architecture; Procurement of COTS chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense equipment; Integration of COTS, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), and GFI into a systems solution; Devel opment and integration of the system's Command and Control (C2) architecture into the installation's Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) network for installation protection and emergency responder control.

The Government anticipates the award of one (1) contract under full and open competition.  This contract will be awarded as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract with Cost Reimbursable Materials and Travel.  Direction will be given to the LSI via Technical Directives (TDs).  It is anticipated that the TDs will be issued as CPFF in the beginning; once the requirements become mor e fully developed, we anticipate issuing Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) TDs or TDs with FFP elements.  This contract is planned to be issued for a three-year base period of performance with the potential for three (3) one-year Award Term extensions.  The Governmen t does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors.  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess a SECRET facility security clearance.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is issuing a DRAFT solicitation for Technical and Management Support (TAMS). The correct North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330 with a size standard of $23.0 million. The Draft solicitation is being issued for Informational Purposes Only. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this notice or the Draft solicitation document. The Draft solicitation is available for downloading on the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) located at the following internet address: http://e-center.doe.gov. If you need technical assistance in registering with IIPS, downloading the Draft solicitation, or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk at IIPS-HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. This support contract will provide planning, program management, and communications support to NETL?s Federal project managers, product managers, policy analysts, public affairs officer, and researchers. This support will be primarily of a general nature, providing reviews and analyses of existing data and continuing ongoing tasks to provide assistance to NETL program and project areas. As part of this support, the contractor will assist NETL personnel in planning programs, administrating programs and projects consistent with and in response to NETL-management and DOE/HQ direction, and communicating with stakeholders and the general public. These support services will be provided to NETL personnel at four locations in Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, Tulsa, OK, and Alaska. It is expected that the core support personnel will be employed by a small business and that these personnel will primarily consist of qualified scientists, engineers, energy analysts, and public affairs specialists. Most of the support personnel will physically be located at NETL sites, but the support contract will include provisions for short-term, off-site efforts when these are justified by cost, staff, or timing considerations. The contract to provide these technical and management support services will be performance-based. The contract will include measurable performance standards that will assure the timely performance of services or delivery of reports. Contract performance will be encouraged by incentives (e.g., award fee) and measured according to a performance evaluation plan. NETL has initiated an electronic reading room as part of the strategy to provide information that may benefit potential offerors in preparing their proposals. The information is provided to assist the reader in gaining an enhanced understanding of the requirement. The reading rooms are under construction and changes should be expected throughout this process and up to the issuance of the solicitation. The reading rooms may be accessed at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business/solicit/ssc2003/index.html . A FOIA release version of the current contract has been posted to the electronic reading room. Offerors requesting a FOIA copy of the current contract will be directed to the reading room to download it from that location. Summary information, including the estimated range of dollar value, estimated FTE?s, and anticipated type of contract are posted to the electronic reading room. It is anticipated that the formal TAMS solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page in February 2004. Questions relating to the solicitation are required to be submitted electronically through the question submittal option of the IIPS program. ONLY those questions posted to the IIPS program will be accepted. All responses to solicitation questions will be released on the IIPS Internet page. The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS. This is an electronic solicitation therefore no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available. At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, and to submit a proposal. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.

<DESC>1.  Revision (in parenthesis) to Section C.12.2.1 – The Contractor shall provide the COTR with a list of the CEST teams professional training prior to reporting to post.  Records of ongoing training shall also be (available) to the COTR (for review and inspection upon request.) 

2.  Questions and Answers are provided and made a part of this solicitation:

Ref. C-7 - These types of backgrounds are very expensive processes to request, from the standpoint of both time and money for all involved.  We suggest and request that we be permitted to provide evidence of US government suitability determinations for staff like access or security clearance verification in lieu of this requirement.  This would mean the requirement has already been met on a far greater level that could be provided by “private” checks, and would eliminate redundant federal dollars being spent.

Answer:  Contractors must demonstrate how their background checks meet or exceed C.7.1.2.  Discuss the process of conducting your background checks.

Ref. C-8 - If my personnel have already worked the Center on numerous occasions, I am assuming that this would be unnecessary.  Is that assumption safe?

Answer:  Contractor personnel must meet each of the requirements established in Section C.8.  Contractor’s technical proposal must demonstrate that they have obtained prior knowledge, training, and or orientation to meet the requirements of C.12.1.1 and 2. 

Ref. C.10.7 - Is that to mean the Center will not provide parking for the team(s) unless the team pays for parking?

Answer:  Yes.

Ref. C.12.1.1 & 2 -  Same question as C-8 above.

Answer:  Yes, Contractor personnel must meet each of the requirements established in Section C.12.  Contractor’s technical proposal must demonstrate that they have obtained prior knowledge, training, and or orientation to meet the requirements of C.12.1.1 and 2.

Ref. C.12.2.1 -   We perform a significant amount of in-service training.  Notifying the Center upon completion of any of it represents a major administrative burden, let alone within a certain period of time.  Typically, the office here may not even receive the completion form for a couple of weeks.  I am going to request this be waived, but if ever questioned by the COTR, then the records as they are at the time of the request can be faxed at that time.  Will this be acceptable?

Answer:    See revised C.12.2.1

Lastly, may I request an electronic copy of your SF-33 as it will save us having to retype all of the information.

Answer:  We are unable to provide with an electronic copy of the solicitation, due to a lack of capability at this time.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island intends to compete a requirement for Maintenance and Operation (M&O) services for the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC).  AUTEC is a deep water, test and evaluation facility for making underwater acoustic measurements, testing and calibrating sonars, and providing accurate underwater, surface and in-air tracking data on submarines, surface ships, aircraft, and weapons systems in support of the U.S.  Navy's undersea warfare, research and development programs, as well as for assessment of Fleet operational readiness.  AUTEC is located on Andros Island, in the Bahamas with a stateside support facility located in West Palm Beach, Florida.  The AUTEC M&O contract entails support for planning/conduct/reporting of range test programs, maintenance and operation of range instrumentation and related test support systems, and performance of all base operations functions and related requirements.  Site visits will be held at the Andros Island and West Palm Beach facilities from 1-5-04 through 1-15-04.  The purpose of the site visits is to allow interested vendors to tour the facilities and to observe work in process.  Due to limits on air transportation services and transient quarters available on Andros Island to support the site visits, vendors will be limited to not more than two individuals per company at any one time.  Additional information regarding site visit reservations, restrictions and security clearance requirements may be found at http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/ under the heading: Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) Information.

<DESC>Sources Sought:  Energy Conservation financial incentive and rebate administration.

The Greater Southwest Region of GSA has received an unsolicited proposal to provide full services to apply for and obtain energy conservation, rebates and financial incentives, for the government. The services to be provided have been identified below. GSA seeks to identify additional firms providing this type of service. This is not a solicitation. There is no solicitation available at this time.

The Greater Southwest Region of the U.S. General Services Administration is investigating and evaluating an unsolicited proposal to provide services from a firm seeking to handle all aspects of application for financial incentives and rebates. The proposal seeks to identify, monitor, update and track financial incentive and rebate programs, offered by States, Utilities, and others, that the government would be eligible to participate in.  These programs are offered by a variety of State and local government offices, utilities, and other entities.  Such programs often provide for financial or other incentives to install energy efficient equipment, to promote energy conservation, to reduce water use, or to take measures that improve the environment.  The Government is interested in identifying firms that currently maintain databases of such financial incentives, and that also make application for the rebates (at no cost to the government) on the government’s behalf. The sole financial compensation to the firm would be a “success fee” or “contingent fee” where the firm is paid out of a portion, or small percentage, of the funds they located, successfully obtained for the government, and made available to the government for its projects. The government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this sources sought.  Any response to this sources sought should clearly mark as proprietary any information the submitter desires be protected from release outside of the government.

This notice of sources sought is directed to those who are presently engaged in providing similar services to the real property, and construction community and to commercial property owners. Those responding should have experience in this business and the existing database, business knowledge, and expertise, as well as the financial ability to support such a business effort.

Readers of this notice should be aware that if the firm’s efforts were to be unsuccessful it would receive nothing by way of payment from the government. The entire risk of success is with the service provider.  Those who read this sources sought and that are interested in such opportunities with the government should contact Mr. Kevin Myles, at kevin.myles@gsa.gov or by mailing Mr. Myles at GSA (7PMA) 819 Taylor Street, Fort Worth, Texas. 76102.  This notice of sources sought will close on January 9, 2004.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is seeking potential sources for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) options for upgrading the existing wire harness testing capabilities at USN and USMC Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA). This activity is conducting market research only. The desired upgrade will be the result of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) of the existing Wire Test Set (WTS).  The WTS is comprised of the Test Control Unit (TCU), comprising all computing and instrumentation functions and the Switching Unit (SU), comprising all switch functions and interface for a maximum of 500 test points.  The WTS has the capability to daisy chain up to 4 SUs to a single TCU, providing up to 2000 test points.  The desired reconfiguration of the Enhanced WTS includes the elimination of the TCU and consolidation of all additional equipments (addressed below) into a single SU case (20” W x 11” H x 18” D).  It is envisioned that the TCU can be eliminated by consolidation of computer hardware and software in a separate, ruggedized, stand-alone computing capability (e.g. laptop, TabletPC, PDA).  Consolidation of required TPS interface, power supplies, switching matrix, instrumentation and any other required functionality should be able to be incorporated into the existing SU case.  Respondents to this RFI may provide catalogs, drawings/illustrations, technical manuals, Training description/material, calibration requirements (if any), recommended spare parts list, warranty, life cycle (ten year) technical and parts support, Test documentation, brochures and/or any other documentation that describes the companies capability to manufacture and support a machine of the type described in this announcement.

2.	Integration of synthetic instrumentation: These test capabilities shall be compatible with LabView or similar software suites and Integrated into the COTS system. The desired test capability contained within the Enhanced WTS shall, at a minimum, have the ability to measure continuity, define type and distance to fault, and provide hipot testability with no external equipment connectivity.  

3.	Interface for integration of new test technologies: The system shall have external interfaces (e.g. USB, RS-232, Ethernet) connections to allow for future “Plug and Play” instrumentation integration.

4.	Upgrade the available test points to 1000 per case.  

Critical parameters:
1.	Performance/Test Capabilities and Documentation.
2.	Technical Documentation:  Setup and Operation, Repair Processes and Available Training Media.
3.	Delivery Schedules.
4.      Catalog pricing.

It is requested that respondents identify Government and/or commercial customers currently using this equipment for the intended purpose of the equipment.  Please provide customer point of contact, including a telephone number, e-mail address or web site, quantities sold along with dates sold, and a description of the unit(s).  Please provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manual or any other documentation that would describe a unit/s or system/s to meet the above requirement.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 01/31/04 to Ms. Nancy Delaney, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: Nancy.Delaney@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firms submitting a proposal must register in the GSA ITSS system prior to closing date for receipt of proposals.   Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Fl is equipping its new Air Traffic Control Tower. This requirement was originally solicited under another solicitation number and cancelled.  Two proposals were received under the cancelled solicitation.  (Previous price quotations received under the cancelled RFP ranged from $260,000 to $279,000).  The tower requires a fully integrated Voice Communications System for Air Traffic Control. This system will provide control of air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communications to include access to radios and public and private telephone networks.

The system should have superior voice quality and non-blocking access to all audio channels. A touch screen control panel is preferred. Four workstations are required. Three workstations will be located in the tower cab in console locations designated by KSC. One workstation will be installed in the Landing Aids Control Building (LACB). LACB is located approximately 2 miles from the tower. Eight air to ground radio systems are required for the tower. Three radios will be GFE.  Successful offeror will procure additional radios as described below and install all eight systems at the tower location.

Facility shall be available from 7am to 3:30pm local time. All contactor employees must obtain KSC badge.  Delivery and installation should be within 90 days of order placement. 
2.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-2 titled “Evaluation-Commercial Items” shall apply.  Technical merit is more important than price.  However, when technical differences become less significant, price will become increasingly more important.   Total proposed price will be evaluated.  Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, may receive no further consideration.  The Government will evaluate technical proposals based on the factors of past experience and technical approach with past experience being slightly more important than technical approach.  Past experience will be evaluated according to the extent to which the offeror’s documented past experience is similar to the nature, complexity, and scope of work described in the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate each offeror’s technical approach for completeness, the extent to which it demonstrates that it will meet requirements in an effective manner, and qualifications of those assigned (if applicable) to carry out the technical approach being offered.    The offeror shall describe its approach for meeting the requirements of the SOW and how it plans to conduct the work.  To support the past experience evaluation, please list the dollar value of similar project, timeframe completed, brief description of your firm’s role in project, etc.  Technical proposals should be limited to no more than 10 pages.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4,Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition 11. The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation.

The E-6 CFCTS contract provides a complete range of field support for more than five training devices including: contractor operation and maintenance services (COMS); contractor instruction (CI) in the classroom, at the simulators, and in-flight; instructional systems development (ISD); and planned trainer modifications (both major and minor).

The extension performance period is necessary to complete the Multiple Display System (MDS) cockpit modification and Automated Data Processing and Weight Savings (ADWS) modification on Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) #2, followed by technical data and curriculum development in support of the E-6B Contractor Flight Crew Training Systems (CFCTS) contract.  

The MDS modification requires adapting the present Navy E-6 Operational Flight Trainers from its analog cockpit instrument and display configuration to a 737-700 glass cockpit/avionics system that meets all Communication Navigation Surveillance (CNS) Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Global Air Traffic Management (GATM).
