<SUBJECT>99--ADS-B NAS Wide Acquisition Program  Advance Notification to Industry
<SOLNBR>4713
<RESPDATE>042106
<ARCHDATE>05212006
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>This announcement advises industry that the FAA intends to transition R&D surveillance and broadcast services (consisting of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B); Traffic Information Service- Broadcast (TIS-B); and Flight Information   Service - Broadcast  (FIS-B), under FAA's Technology Development Service Unit (ATO-P), to FAA's Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office under FAA's En Route Service Unit (ATO-E).  The Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office proposes to develop a NAS wide acquisition program for ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B with a goal of an "in-service decision" by 2010. To date, FAA has accomplished R&D efforts relating to portions of an ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B infrastructure, through installation of prototype "ground base stations" (GBTs) deployed as part of a network of individual state initiatives funded through memorandums of agreements with FAA.  Additionally, the FAA has executed regional ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B projects in Alaska.  These efforts are not consistent in their capabilities or configurations.  Each R&D effort is associated with a regional coverage volume.  None represents an integrated ADS-B, TIS-B, FIS-B capability related to an approved national program and its associated documentation requirements.      On September 9, 2005, the FAA Joint Resources Council (JRC) approved an initial investment decision for a future surveillance ADS-B capability.  A team was established within ATO-E responsible for developing, implementing, and managing an integrated ADS-B NAS wide program.  The team is seeking a final investment decision from the JRC in June 2006.  Upon program approval, there will be only one ADS-B, TIS-B, FIS-B "acquisition" program office within FAA.  The coverage volumes currently provided by existing R&D equipment will eventually be enveloped by the NAS wide acquisition.      This announcement will be the first of several with a goal of engaging industry in early collaborative thinking and dialogue regarding the ADS-B,  TIS-B,and FIS-B requirements.  The first segment of the program will consist of: 1.	Targeted ADS-B, TIS-B, FIS-B infrastructure deployment. 2.	Avionics equipage initiation.  3.	Commencement of initial aircraft to aircraft application deployment. 4.	Definition of additional aircraft to aircraft requirements.     Note: Options will be included in any awarded contract(s) for expansion of coverage areas.    On December 16, 2005, ATO-P posted a Request for Information (RFI) on the FAA Contract Opportunities Webpage.  The RFI presented a draft specification for an ADS-B Broadcast Services Ground System (BSGS) for industry review and comment.  The FAA expresses appreciation for the meaningful and thought-out industry comments.  A predominant theme in the comments was that a performance specification would benefit the FAA more than a design specification.  The FAA concurs with industry comments and has commenced drafting of an ADS-B, TIS-B, FIS-B performance specification.  It is believed that a performance specification will allow greater flexibility in execution of a solicitation.  With a performance specification, the FAA will have an option of a "traditional" solicitation wherein offerors would present designs, manufacture, test, and deliver equipment to FAA or an option where offerors would propose their approach for satisfying the performance service requirements using their own facilities and equipment without any delivery to or ownership by FAA.  The later option allows industry to utilize and maintain equipment that does not meet all the FAA imposed requirements such as wiring bend radius, physical dimensions, markings, etc.  Provision of a service would be the contract deliverable, in the same manner as cell phone and cable TV providers.  In addition, a significant portion of design review and testing would be eliminated through a service provider concept.  It is also believed that this option would give industry flexibility in teaming arrangements with various combinations of ADS-B, FIS-B, and TIS-B services, technical approaches, and use of existing infrastructure such as cell phone towers.      The FAA is also considering the potential of breaking up the NAS service area and awarding one or more contracts.      Consideration is being given to a performance based acquisition whereby industry would be given the opportunity to create contract pricing terms and conditions.  The FAA is interested in unique approaches which allow both incentives to the contractor and penalties for non-performance.  FAA is open to discussion of methodologies to reduce the overall cost of broadcast services through potential added opportunities created for broadcast services providers.    The BSGS draft specification, modified as appropriate by industry comment, will also be provided as guidance and information, possibly before any formal solicitation.     Once the investment decision is approved by the JRC, a series of industry exchanges will be commenced.      It is also recognized that some vendors may have patents associated with ADS-B, FIS-B, or TIS-B capabilities.  FAA is considering a request to industry for identification of patents related to ADS-B, TIS-B and FIS-B.  Those patents will be subsequently announced in order to facilitate any future teaming arrangements.  This will also aid industry in researching any patent issues while forming technical approaches.  .       A future public announcement will provide proposed schedules and milestones.  At the present time, an RFO is planned for the second quarter of FY 2007.   This announcement is for information purposes only.  It is not a request for information or proposals.     Creation of the ADS-B, TIS-B, FIS-B requirement for a national baseline is contingent upon approval by the FAA JRC.    The FAA Technical Point of contact is Mr. Vincent Capezzuto 202-385-8637 .

<DESC>DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATION, AND ENGINEERING (DICCE) SERVICES, DE-RP52-06NA26990.  Proposal Disallowed Reason:  This is a sources sought announcement -- NOT a request for proposals. Description:  This is a sources sought "re-synopsis" for Design, Integration, Construction, Communication, and Engineering (DICCE) services.  The "re-synopsis" provides an up-to-date description of the DICCE services. The original synopsis was posted on September 6, 2005. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) seeks qualified small businesses, small business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small business capable of performing Design, Integration, Construction, Communications, and Engineering (DICCE) services for the Second Line of Defense (SLD) Program.  The SLD Program is comprised of two major elements:  The Core Program and the Megaports Initiative.  The Core Program provides equipment at land border crossings, airports, and feeder seaports while the Megaports Initiative focuses on large international container seaports.  SLD provides commercially available radiation detection portal monitors, communications systems, and handheld devices to assist local officials with detection and deterrence of illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive material, thereby reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation and terrorism.  The objective of this procurement is to design and install sustainable radiation detection and communication systems at selected international border crossings, airports and seaports throughout the world.  The focus is on the integration activities that are needed for the development and deployment of radiation detection and communication systems that are robust, are cost effective, will not disrupt port or customs operations, that can be adjusted for the unique needs of a specific application and that are easy to use, configure and maintain. Under the authority of agreements with the host countries, the SLD program intends to install equipment in up to 40 Megaports and at several hundred transit sites in over 30 foreign countries during the term of the DICCE contract.  The countries under consideration by the SLD program include countries in the Former Soviet Union, Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and other regions to be determined.  In the event SLD is able to obtain timely agreements in all planned locations and pursues a strategy that includes all services at each site, the rough order of magnitude for all work under this notice is in the four to five hundred million dollar ($400 - $500M) range.  All work is dependent upon written agreement with the host government.  The Government makes no commitment or assurance that the full magnitude of work will ultimately be ordered. The SLD Program works closely with host government officials, National Laboratories, other U.S. government agencies, and private contractors to successfully carry out the SLD mission.  The DICCE contractor will be a major contributor to the overall SLD team effort and will be required to work closely with and support all team members.  The DICCE contractor will be required to perform DICCE services in a variety of environments and under diverse conditions and in diverse cultural settings. Program experience has shown that integrating the design, construction and communications effort is critical to meeting program cost and schedule requirements, and minimizes disruption to local port and border operations. An integrating contractor is necessary to lead these efforts and will be responsible for ensuring all design requirements, contractor furnished equipment, government furnished equipment, construction materials, in-country contracting and construction are coordinated and completed as required. SLD strongly encourages the DICCE contractor to subcontract with local construction firms for the installation of the SLD systems. A cost-reimbursement form of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, with a five-year ordering period, is contemplated.  Award by April, 2007 is planned. Services Sought: Design Services:  Provide complete and certified architectural and engineering design services. â€¢ Installation designs for radiation detection equipment, video, motion, and security systems â€¢ Buildings and structures to house alarm station and emergency centers â€¢ Site access, boundary and perimeter control systems for seaports, airports, border crossings â€“ pedestrians, vehicles, and trains â€¢ Communication systems that include microwave, web based communications, fiber optics, cable and radio-frequency systems â€¢ Training centers, test, maintenance and repair facilities Integration Services: â€¢ Coordinate with third parties and Government Furnished Equipment contractors on equipment specifications, deliveries, and installation requirements â€¢ Coordinate with host country representatives on design and construction activities to ensure a seamless implementation process â€¢ Ensure all construction and installation activities have been accomplished. Construction Services:  Working in conjunction with U.S. and host country contractors, provide facility construction, sensor system installation, communication system installation, landscaping, asbestos and lead abatement, utility system upgrades such as water (portable and fire), telephone/computer systems (other communications), and emergency power. Communication Services:  Provide communications systems that collect, store, and display data received from the radiation monitoring locations.  The data includes radiation monitor data, video and user data entries.  The systems may include intra-site communications between computing systems(s) and the portal and handheld detectors. The SLD architecture is made up of several system elements.  Not all ports or countries will require each of these elements, and some elements may need to be modified to operate under site-specific conditions.  The elements may include: â€¢ Local Alarm Station (LAS) â€¢ Central Alarm Station (CAS) â€¢ Mother CAS  (connects two or more CASs) â€¢ Regional Center â€¢ National Center Engineering Services:  Provide specialized expertise and engineering services required for design and construction activities at SLD transit sites and Megaports, and in support of SLD mission requirements. Logistics Services: As the integrating contractor, the DICCE contractor shall provide logistical support as necessary for in-country construction. Logistics services may include but are not limited to transportation, translation, and interpretation services. Maintenance and Training:  The DICCE contractor may be required to provide limited maintenance and repair of equipment during construction and up to equipment turn over.  The DICCE Contractor will support training on equipment operation and maintenance at the time of equipment turnover.  Long term maintenance and in depth radiation detection training will generally be the responsibility of others. NAICS Code:  237990 -- Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction ($31M size standard) has been identified based upon review of the industries under which the required work is classified (ref FAR 19.102). Requested Information: Interested parties are asked to submit by April 21, 2006 a Statement of Capability (SOC) to NNSA using the format that follows: A.

Each company experience summary should include (a) name of project, (b) brief description of project, (c) contract or project number, (d) client/customer point of contact (name, address, phone), (e) dollar value of the contract/project, (f) period of performance of contract/project, (g) relevance of contract/project to NNSA's requirements described above, and (h) past performance rating demonstrating the capability of the firm(s) to successfully perform the work described in the Services Sought section above. Large businesses need not respond to this announcement.  SOCs shall not exceed 20 letter-size (8.5x11) pages, double-spaced, using 12-point font; pages in excess of the specified limit will not be reviewed.  SOCs submitted in response to this announcement may be used as a basis for future solicitations. Firms responding to the previous DICCE synopsis, dated September 6, 2005, are encouraged to review their original response as it applies to the information provided here. Firms need not, but may at their option, submit a new, superseding statement of capability and experience in response to this synopsis. In addition to the information requested as part of the SOCs, NNSA requests frank and constructive industry comment on the acquisition approach outlined in this synopsis (comments should be limited to three (3) pages, in addition to the 20-page SOC page limitation).  The above Services Sought are presently performed under two separate contracts for design/construction and communications.  The Government has not identified factors that would make it likely that this acquisition is unsuitable for award to a small business concern.  However, comment and rationale are requested concerning whether the combined scope of the two contracts for design/construction and communications services could constitute "bundling" as defined at FAR 2.101.  Comment and rationale should specifically explain how any of the factors at FAR 2.101 impact the suitability of this acquisition to be awarded to a small business concern. Additional Information: This announcement is being used to determine whether sufficient small business interest and capability exist to set this acquisition aside for Small Business (e.g., small business, HUBZone small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business) or conduct a competitive 8(a) acquisition. NNSA is a strong advocate for the small business community.  Interested small businesses, small business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  This notice is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  NNSA may pursue additional methods of identifying suitable approaches and qualified vendors for this work.  Interested parties are strongly encouraged to monitor this site for further information on this action.  All notices will be posted on DOE E-Center and on FedBizOpps. Responses must be received through the IIPS website (http://e-center.doe.gov/) or may be e-mailed to Douglas Bergevin at DBergevin@doeal.gov.  Assistance with IIPS is available in the IIPS Users Guide on-line help document, available at that same website.  Only electronic copies of the SOC will be accepted.

<DESC>Integrated Project Delivery and Project Management

Synopsis

Integrated Project Delivery and Project Management

Synopsis

Bridge engineers have used accelerated bridge construction practices successfully for many years worldwide.  Now with the advent of high performance materials and emerging new technologies, the paradigm is rapidly changing to give greater emphasis on accelerated construction for renewal of the Nation’s highway infrastructure involving roads, bridges, and other structures.  The accelerated bridge construction technology with automated fabrication, construction and preservation aligns itself well with the strategic goals of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in improving safety, mobility and production, human and natural environments and organizational excellence.

The scope of this work includes developing a demonstration project for steel and concrete bridges to achieve “Integrated Project Delivery and Project Management” objectives and identify available technologies; develop integrated engineering software demonstration package(s) that has promise to promote faster and more efficient automated processes applicable through the entire life cycle (design, fabrication, construction, and preservation) for bridge owners and contractors.  The engineering software package will include guidelines and training materials to drive transition among users from current practices to synergistic integrated automation.  Integrated automation through 3-D modeling will include an extension of the conventional 2-D methodology in designing, constructing and maintaining bridges.  This project will generate an architectural blueprint for integrating various phases into the automated processes yet it will have the potential to produce significantly improved 2-D design drawings as well as construction drawings in conjunction with life cycle management through automation.    Concepts identified will be evaluated for feasibility and those found to have merit, shall be recommended for the development and demonstrations including half-day and two-day modules.   

It is anticipated that the resulting contract duration will be for 30 months.  It is anticipated this requirement will be Full and Open to all sources.  The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system at http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the Vendors option followed by selection of the Department of Transportation (DOT) center.    As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored.  Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541710.  NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302, “Other Than Full and Open Competition”, to Applanix Corporation for warranty coverage and POS MV V-3 PCS to V-4 Upgrades.  [Warranty coverage will be for 24 POSs and there are 10 upgrades.] Applanix Corporation is the sole developer and supplier of PCS platforms; thus, the only known source that can fulfill the upgrade needs and provide adequate post warranty coverage for existing POS's.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the Government will consider all quotes received within six (6) days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete as a result of quotes received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Narrative Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

This procurement is being conducted under 41 USC 253(c) (1), “only one responsible source”, in specifying a single manufacturer to meet the Agency's minimum needs.  The following justification describes the requirement for system components built by one manufacturer: Applanix LLC, 17461 Village Green Drive, Houston, TX  77040-1004.

Discussion:

This request is to establish warranty coverage and accomplish upgrades to existing POS/MV systems.  This warranty coverage and upgrades are proprietary and can only be done by the original manufacturer, Applanix. These systems are installed throughout the existing NOAA fleet. 

In consideration of the warranty with software and firmware updates through 12/31/06, Applanix has quoted a warranty that is deemed the best value option to protect these units which are no longer covered under the original factory warranty.

The service being purchased is fair and reasonable to upgrade existing V3 systems. There are no other known sources of this service except direct purchase from the manufacturer. NOAA has multiple other Version 3 POS/MV units that are functional.  In anticipation of possible failure and/or upgrade to meet emerging requirements, NOAA is requesting future options on these units.

<DESC>Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) supports deliberate and crisis action planning by providing users the capability to: receive and analyze taskings; develop, compare, and prioritize alternative Courses of Action (COAs); and prepare documents which support the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), Unified Command, and Air Force requirements and taskings. Specifically, DCAPES will help planners to electronically: access United States Air Force (USAF) planning and execution data; create and maintain War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)-3/4/5 data; exchange data with other command and control systems; create and manage Unit Type Codes (UTCs); produce Time Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD); compare planning data in different databases; perform feasibility and capability analysis in support of logistics, manpower, personnel, and transportation requirements; and develop planning and execution documents. DCAPES will evolve current war planning and execution system capabilities and technology insertions by facilitating interoperability and integration. DCAPES will capitalize on savings realized by integrating common and consistent functional and technical capabilities across mission boundaries and eliminating duplication in functionality, support requirements, acquisition programs management, and integration processes. We anticipate issuing an ID/IQ contract with a 5-year ordering period and a mixture of CLIN types, to include CPAF, FFP, and CR items for the continued development and support of DCAPES software.

<DESC>The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the restoration of a former runway at Schleswig Airfield.

The FRG is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The estimated value of this project is 7.9 million Euro ($9.6 million USD). The references for the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) are

1.	AC/43-(PP)N(2006)0010 dated 18/01/2006

The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-GERMANY-AC4-DS-2006.

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 21 April 2006

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the fabrication and testing of 12 spherical composite over-wrapped pressure vessels (COPV) test articles at cryogenic temperatures for spacecraft applications. Six of the articles will have an Inconel 718 liner while the remaining six will have an Al 2219 liner. The COPV is used as a storage vessel for high pressure helium gas for the pressurization subsystem of a propulsion system. The COPV has a thin inner metal liner that acts as a sealant surface. The strength to withstand pressure on a COPV is provided by the overwrap which is a combination of graphite fiber and epoxy.

<DESC>Contractor peculiar recoverable spares and peculiar consumables for the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) - The Air Armament Center, Air-to-Air Missile Wing, Aerial Targets SPO, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL intends to issue a sole-source modification to an existing contract with Composite Engineering Inc., located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 92632.  The sole source modification will be for the purchase of peculiar recoverable spares and peculiar consumables for the AFSAT procured under contract F08635-02-C-0005.  These items include, but are not limited to composite airframe components, command and control and avionics equipment, nose cones, RATO attachment kits, and empennage heat shields.  These items must be compatible with the existing AFSAT design and initial deliveries are required NLT 31 Dec 2006 in order to meet the AFSAT Required Assets Available (RAA) schedule.  An initial quantity of the peculiar recoverable spares and consumables to be used during operations of the AFSAT was procured under a competitively awarded contract with Composite Engineering, Inc., using full and open competition procedures.  However, the need for additional quantities of peculiar recoverable spares and consumables for use in AFSAT operations has been identified.  It is anticipated that only Composite Engineering Inc. has the ability to provide these items.  A Government-owned technical data package of the AFSAT design does not exist to provide interested parties.  The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.   Composite Engineering Inc. is the prime contractor for the current AFSAT contract and has been since the inception of the program in 2002.  The government has determined that the only way to minimize adverse impact to critical mission activities requiring continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets and associated peculiar recoverable spares and consumables is to issue a modification to the existing contract to the incumbent vendor.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of the FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to design, manufacture, and deliver the required spares.  Responses are required NLT 15 May 06.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The current acquisition plan is approved for a maximum capacity of $315 Million; however, it is anticipated that it will be revised and approved for a maximum capacity of $500 Million.  In the event of this approval, the total contract capacity is estimated not to exceed $500 Million over a five-year contract period ($250 Million for Unrestricted and $250 Million for HUB-Zone).  To preclude the need to re-solicit, if Six (6) Contracts cannot be awarde d to HUB-Zone firms, the total combined contract capacity of $500 Million will be distributed by one, or a combination of two methods:  1) equally distributed to the Four (4) successful Unrestricted contractors, or 2) make an additional competitive award t o a Fifth (5th) Unrestricted contractor.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to four (4) Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of sixty (60) months.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5)  the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory  performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the Four (4) Unrestricted Contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $50 Million, and each of the Six (6) HUB-Zone Competitive Contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract per iod is $50 Million.  However, each Unrestricted Contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to the estimated Unrestricted total contract capacity of $250 Million.  Likewise, each HUB-Zone competitive contractor has the opportunity to receive  awards up to the estimated HUB-Zone total contract capacity of $250 Million.  The minimum guarantee for each Unrestricted contract will be $50,000.00.  The min imum guarantee for each HUB-Zone contract will be $50,000.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitati on for both the Unrestricted and HUB-Zone Competitive contracts will be $100,000.00.  The maximum task order limitation for the Unrestricted and HUB-Zone Competitive contracts will be $100 Million and $20 Million, respectively.  After award of the basic co ntracts, Unrestricted contractors will not compete with the HUB-Zone contractors for award of individual task orders.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement, consideration may be given to 1) the complexity of th e work; 2) past performance of the contractor; 3) contract task order limitation; 4) on-going work, 5) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum order limitation.  In th e event the acquisition plan is not approved, the number of unrestricted contracts will be reduced to two (2) and the number of HUBZone contracts will be reduced to four (4).  A modification to the synopsis will be issued to provide details on the amounts per pool (unrestricted and HUBZone) and other pertinent information.  Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about April 20, 2006, under solicitation number W9126G-06-R-0005, after the Acquisition Plan has been approved.  Proposals are anticipated to b e due on or about May 23, 2006 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference, details regarding the Conference will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisi tion  there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon the overall Best Value to the Government.  Procurement consideration will be given to technical capability (including specialized experience, past performance, organizati on and management, key personnel, safety record, quality control, and schedule capability), price and other salient factors included in the solicitation.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a  Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 51.2%; Small Disadvantaged Business 8.8%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.3%; HUB-Zone Small B usiness 3.1%, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 1.5%.

IN ADDITION, THE TAG ALSO COLLECTS AND STORES DETAILED INDIVIDUAL DIVIE AND HAULOUT INFORMATION AS WELL AS TEMPERATURE UP-CAST PROFILES.  THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT IS THE INCORPORATION OF A MOBILE PHONE MODEM THAT RELAYS STORED DATA ASHORE.  THE SMRU IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY KNOWN SOURCE FOR THESE SPECIFIC GSM/GPS TELEMETRY TAGS FOR USE ON MARINE SPECIES AND THEY POSSESS THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY.  THE TAGS ONLY FUNCTION ON EUROPEAN CELL PHONE FREQUENCIES AND NEED TO BE MODIFIED FOR APPLICATION IN THE UNITED STATES.  UNITS MUST BE MODIFIED AND DELIVERED BY 10/31/2006.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING PROPOSED ACQUISITION MAY BE DIRECTED TO RANDALL BROWN.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

<DESC>Solicitation No. 678-0076-06, furnish all labor, material, equipment, and supervision to complete Project No. 678-313, Research Wet Labs at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, 3601 S. 6th Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85730. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for eligible 8(a) firms. 8(a) firms must meet the Small Business Administrations (SBA) criterion, and have previously been certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm, which have a NAICS Code 236220 having a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years. Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents (i.e., tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists etc.) must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award. Incomplete packages will be returned without action. The Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract. Failure to obtain SBAs approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBAs request to the buying activity to terminate the award. Offers from concerns other than 8(a) will not be considered. The general description of work includes construction of a new free-standing research laboratory building. This building is approximately 6,400 gross square feet, slab-on grade, single-story construction with a reinforced concrete foundation and masonry exterior walls with a built-up low-pitch roof. A new equipment yard of approximately 1,650 square feet is to be constructed adjacent to the new building. Also included is construction of a vertical circulation addition to the south end of the existing Building 6 (nearby the new building site), as well as selective renovation and building service and utility upgrades. Building 6 contains approximately 12,500 square feet of occupiable space. The selective renovation pertains primarily to building and fire code deficiencies. The project includes a significant amount of underground utility work (most utilities are privately-owned) associated with the new building construction, the construction of the vertical circulation addition, and with new building services. Asbestos abatement (flooring, pipe insulation, crawlspace earth excavation, and exterior finish) is included in the project scope. During selective demolition, worker protection, handling and disposal of lead-based painted materials will be required. Phases of work will be staggered to provide for completion of all work roughly around the same time and to minimize the amount of time that various sections of Building 6 will need to be vacant. Part of Building 6 (existing labs on the north section of the first floor) will remain occupied during the work, requiring the utility work in this area to be accomplished during hours that can be accommodated by the tenants (primarily evenings and weekends). Contract award is subject to availability of funds. Performance period is 495 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Project Magnitude is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. Issue Date is scheduled on/about 4/11/06.  Pre-Bid Conference/Site Visit is scheduled on/about 4/25/06 at 1:00 p.m. Offer due date is 5/12/06 by 3:00 p.m. local time. Solicitation documents and amendments will be available for download on the VA Business Opportunitites Website or the Fed Biz Opps website. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued. Any and all question regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and sent to the Contracting Officer. NOTE: Solicitation is currently being reviewed by Legal and Technical and all information identified above is subject to change.

<CONTACT>James Huff, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-927-7721, Fax 202-927-7311, Email James.Huff@atf.gov
<DESC>Amendment #1 to presolicitation notice for Background Field Investigators to replace original presolicitation notice dated 08/02/2005 with this revised presolicitation notice. This original notice should have been placed under the combined synopsis and solicitation status.

OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.
 
ATF has established a program to use trained, experienced investigators to conduct investigations.  Typically, though not exclusively, the Contractors are retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience conducting personnel security background investigations.

Contractors must undergo, or currently maintain, a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation, be compliant with DOJ’s residency requirement, and if applicable, must be registered in the Selective Service.  Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.

Contractors, are assigned the majority of their work within a 200-mile radius of their residence.  On occasion ATF may request Contractors to accept work assignments involving travel to other regions in the United States.  ATF makes work assignments on the basis of workload, volume of work determined by location, quality of work, and financial considerations as the needs of ATF dictate.

Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Work assignments are required to be completed by the due date determined by ATF.  Internal reviews of Contractors’ performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

With each assignment, Contractors shall be tasked to complete one or more of the following investigative requirements:

-	Personal security interview;
-	Verify identity and citizenship status;
-	Verify employment through records and interviews;
-	Verify claims of residence through records and interviews;
-	Verify attendance at educational facilities through records and interviews;
-	Conduct personal interviews with references;
-	Develop and interview additional sources;
-	Conduct military record reviews;
-	Conduct law enforcement checks;
-	Verify and review public records; 
-	Expand the investigation as necessary.

Each assignment will specify the following:

-	The work to be performed by the Contractor;
-	The place(s) where the work is to be performed;
-	An assignment initiation date;
-	A due date determined by type of investigation and/or priority; and
-	The number of estimated points.

ATF pays Contractors for investigative assignments based on the point system.  Each point is valued at $39.50.  ATF reviews the point value on an annual basis and may adjust it in accordance with a change in “the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers”.  With the exception of the personal security interview, ATF will pay Contractors $12.00 per page for reports they prepare using the Report Writer software program.
 
ATF will reimburse contractors for mileage when if they use their personal automobile to perform assignments, ATF will reimburse Contractors for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.  

ATF will pay per diem and expenses for required travel when specially authorized.  Per diem rates shall correspond with Federal Travel Regulation, Title 41 CFR, Chapter 301.

In compliance with ATF’s invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of miles driven, as well as any other incidental expenses, in connection with any particular assignment.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF.

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are required to report the results of the investigative assignment utilizing Report Writer software, which will be supplied by ATF.  In order to receive assignments and to complete the required Report of Investigation (ROI), Contractors must possess, or have access to, certain equipment, and possess the knowledge to use it (specifically Microsoft Word and Excel).  The following equipment and related software programs are required:

-	A personal computer with a minimum operating system of Windows 2000™ or newer.
-	An Inkjet or LaserJet printer.  Dot-matrix printers are not acceptable equipment.
-	A full version of Microsoft Word®. (Microsoft Works® will not suffice as an acceptable software program.)
- 	Each personal computer must have Microsoft Excel® loaded thereon.
-	Each personal computer must have Microsoft Access® loaded thereon, or Contractors must be able to download from the World Wide Web a “reader” that will permit the Contractor to read Microsoft Access® documents.
-	Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Microsoft Outlook®.  (Microsoft Outlook Express®, standing alone, will not be sufficient.)
-	Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Adobe Acrobat Reader®, version 5.0 or higher.
-	An Internet provider that allows for the transmission and receipt of email and attachments (preferably high speed broadband, DSL, or similar service).
-	The personal computer will have Norton anti-virus or equivalent installed, operational, and running current virus definitions at all times.
-	A hardware or software firewall will be used to protect the personal computer.
-	Facsimile machine or the ability to send and receive faxes from home or home-office.
- 	Paper shredder to destroy documents, notes, and other case related material after 120 days.

Contractors will be required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding regarding protection of ATF data associated with ATF background investigations agreeing to the following terms and provisions:

-	The personal computer will have Norton anti-virus or equivalent installed, operational, and with current virus definitions at all times.
-	ATF data will be password protected using a strong 8-character password.  The password will be changed every 60 days.
-	A hardware or software firewall will be used to protect the home computer.  Shields Up, grc.com, will be run at least every 6 months to assure the computer is sufficiently secure.  Zone Alarm or equivalent firewall software will be installed at the high protect level to assure the Contractor is aware of all program connections to the Internet.
-	Any persistent penetration attempts will be reported to the ATF Personnel Security Branch and the Information Systems Security Officer.
-	Any ATF information transmitted electronically to ATF will be encrypted through software provided by ATF or through other secure transmission methods as ATF shall implement.
-	Any configuration to be connected to ATF will be tested to assure there are no adverse affects on the LAN.
-	Access to the personal computer housing ATF data will be controlled.
-	All Contractors will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.
-	ATF data should be removed from the personal computer as soon as possible.  To assure the data cannot be recovered, ATF data must be purged (overwritten in accordance with ATF security requirements) after use.
-	Dial-in to the ATF LAN is prohibited for this equipment.
-	Blackberry equipment, or other hand-held PDA wireless equipment may not be used to access the ATF LAN.

Contractors will retain all notes and other investigative materials for 120 days after the report is submitted.  

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification which declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice and any supplemental material, whether submitted in hard copy or electronic format, represent actual reported investigative work that was performed and conducted in compliance with requirements of the Statement of Work.

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer.  

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  There is an initial solicitation with a closing date of September 30, 2005.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors. ATF objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation and add new contractors to the pool.  

Proposal Submission Times:

BPA Year 1	August 30, 2005 – September 30, 2005	April 10, 2006 – April 30th, 2006
BPA Year 2	November 1, 2006 – November 30, 2006 	May 1, 2007 – May 31, 2007
BPA Year 3	November 1, 2007 – November 30, 2007	May 1, 2008 – May 31, 2008
BPA Year 4	November 1, 2008 – November 30, 2008	May 1, 2009 – May 31, 2009
BPA Year 5	November 1, 2009 – November 30, 2009

The overall BPA performance period is expected to continue through September 30, 2010.  For consideration of a BPA, all interested offerors should submit a response by 4 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time) on any of the above listed closing date.  Please be advised we cannot accept any offers received outside of the dates listed above or retain offers for consideration in the future.

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 for Investigation Services.  The contractor must list that code in their CCR registration for ATF to consider them for this requirement.

The following clauses  are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial.     (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from  siadministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider awarding a BPA to a vendor, as needed, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the point payment rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 69 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those contractors receiving the highest scores.   At least 45 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 points must come from Vendor Qualifications. 

a.  Experience/Capabilities (60 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breath, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment, experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience), and computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (45 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of how well a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.   (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should submit a current resume with his/her social security number and responses to the below requirements. The vendor must also complete a copy of the FAR 52.212-3, and provide a statement proving the vendor has read and fully understands all the terms and conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.  Resumes should highlight the vendor’s experience and capabilities in performing background investigations.  Please provide examples of your qualifications and how those duties relate to the vendor’s past and/or current performance. These examples will be used in evaluating the vendor’s Qualifications and Past Performance.

Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable, i.e., each individual vendor (person) must submit their own proposal. (No phone calls will be accepted).  

Please provide individual responses to the following:

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:     Substantially Reducing CO emissions from portable engine-powered generators 

A.INTRODUCTION:

The CPSC is concerned about the hazard of acute residential CO exposures from portable gasoline engine-powered generators that can result in death or in serious and/or lasting adverse health effects in exposed individuals.  

Since 1999, the percentage of estimated CO poisoning deaths associated with generators has been increasing annually.  In 1999, generators were associated with 6% of the total yearly estimated CO poisoning deaths.  In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the percentages were 14%, 17%, and 24%, respectively.  Typically, these deaths occur when consumers use a generator in an enclosed space or outdoors near an open door, window or vent.  The output of the majority of light duty generators sold in 2002 was in the 5.1 kW to 6.0 kW range

The CPSC staff is considering various means to limit consumer exposure to the CO produced by portable generators.  One of the strategies being considered is to very substantially limit the tailpipe emission of CO.  

B. REQUEST:

The CPSC staff is interested in obtaining ideas, data, concepts, etc. that may lead to practical approaches to substantially reduce the tailpipe CO emissions from portable gasoline engine-powered generators to levels that could reduce the number of CO poisoning deaths and injuries.  CPSC staff realizes that, while the ideal goal of eliminating the CO poisoning hazard is most likely not feasible, a goal of increasing survivability may be achievable and should be investigated. 

Potential solutions would reduce CO emissions from Class I and/or Class II non-handheld engines within the small spark-ignited engine category to the lowest possible level without negatively affecting engine performance and engine life.  The modified engines would still be required to meet the anticipated EPA Phase III emission requirements.  At the same time, any increase in the fire and burn risk associated with increased temperatures on the exterior of the exhaust system and adjacent engine and generator components must be minimized. Incremental cost increases associated with the CO emission-abatement equipment must be small enough to be consistent with product marketability. 

Based on previous research sponsored by the California Air Resources Board and reviewed by CPSC staff, exhaust catalyst after-treatment, improvements to the engine and/or alternative fuel systems designs may potentially offer realistic solutions.  However, the Government is willing to consider other approaches. CPSC staff has set a tentative target of reducing current emissions by 90% using existing emission-abatement technologies that can be reapplied to small engines. Staff acknowledges this is a very aggressive target, and will consider information on technologies that result in somewhat smaller reductions. Similarly, staff is interested in information that would indicate even further reductions in CO emissions are feasible, to the point of a zero CO-emission system.

We request that responders provide documentation of the technical feasibility of substantially reducing tailpipe emissions in the form of test results (published or clearly marked as proprietary), design options (currently marketed, or proprietary), research (public or proprietary), hardware prototypes with detailed data supporting performance claims, or studies or literature reviews documenting the likely success or failure of achieving a 90% reduction in emissions.  

Parameters we will use in determining technical feasibility will be: 1) amount of CO emissions reduction; 2) effect on engine performance; 3) compatibility with existing engine design; 4) compatibility with anticipated EPA Phase III emission requirements; 5) increased fire/burn risk; and 6) cost.

Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing the likely success of achieving the target emissions reductions while meeting the design parameters listed above.  Particular emphasis will be placed on empirical emissions reduction test data.  All conclusions should be supported by such data, preferably in the form of emissions test measurements.  If emissions test results are provided, the test method and data analysis method must be provided in sufficient detail to allow independent analysis of the results.  If the responder provides a compilation of published test results from other sources, the results should be summarized in a form that allows direct comparison of results. 

Responders should address the following questions in their submissions:
1.	What is the minimum CO emissions rate (g/kW-hr.) achievable using currently available technologies without significantly degrading engine performance or life?
2.	What effect if any would the technologies have on engine performance and life?
3.	What is the minimum CO emissions rate (g/kW-hr.) achievable without significantly increasing the risk of fire or consumer burn injuries?
4.	What would be the size and nature of the effect on the temperature of the engine components, exhaust, and exhaust system exterior?
5.	How would existing engines need to be modified to accept the proposed technologies?
6.	How much would successful emissions controls add to the cost of current portable generator designs?
7.	What factors or circumstances could reduce these costs?
8.	What are the tradeoffs between CO emissions reduction, complexity of the emissions control technology, added risk of fire or burn injuries, effect on engine performance and life, and cost?
9.	How long would it take to bring adequate emissions control technology to the market?
10.	Would CO emissions abatement affect the maintenance or service requirements of the generators or their power supply? 
11.	What effects would the proposed technology have on the overall size and portability of the product?
12.	Does the proposed technology require power to operate? 

Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the Contracting Office address indicated above, Attn: Kim Miles no later April 28, 2006.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources in support of the Targets and Countermeasures Directorate (MDA/DET).  MDA/DET is conducting market research to identify Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small Businesses (SB) that have prior experience or the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate their capability to develop, fabricate, maintain, integrate and test missile systems and instrumentation packages, and provide launch services for low fidelity ballistic missile targets to demonstrate the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) asset readiness for major tests, the cost of which typically ranges from $250,000 to $2 Million, dependent upon complexity.  Systems will support multiple customers at different ranges with varying missile configurations.  The missile/test requirement includes:
                                                                 
1)	Maximum use of excess government furnished property (GFP) rocket motors along with existing hardware such as aft skirts and fin sets and use existing mature technology to fabricate and successfully launch the test missiles. If, after analysis of requirements and considering available GFP motors and other assets, it is determined that these assets can not meet requirements, the contractor would make a recommendation for commercial motor(s) as alternative solutions. 
2)	Requested missiles will normally be flown unguided and without a flight termination system (FTS) from rail launchers at a number of different launch sites.  
3)	A number of separation planes on the mission/test article based on the number of rocket motors.
4)	Separation systems to reduce tip off rates.
5)	Possible requirements for the encryption of data.
6)	Articles in the field of regard to include the nose cone, attitude control/payload section, items ejected as payload, and spent rocket motor(s).  
7)	Attitude control/payload section with or without a spent rocket motor attached could be required to hold attitude, tumble, roll, ordnance initiation devices, etc. at prescribed mission times or altitudes.  
8)	Selected sections such as the nose cone and attitude control/payload section would usually require an instrumentation and telemetry system able to provide position, velocity, roll rate, and attitude data for collection
9)	Additional instrumentation in the form of pressure transducers, thermal couples, etc. may be required based on specific mission needs.  
                                                                 
All efforts would be closely coordinated with the government and their selected support contractors to accomplish mission objectives.

<RESPDATE>041306
<ARCHDATE>06122006
<CONTACT>debra a matthews, 919-549-4385
<DESC>The U.S. Army has made a significant investment in basic research in High Performance Computing (HPC) and its application as well as the infrastructure to support such research.  This was underscored by the establishment, in 1989, and the continued s ustainment thereafter of the Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC), hereinafter called the Center.  Armys investments in HPC have resulted in the increasing utilization of computer based modeling and simulation by the Army scientific an d engineering community.  These investments have also created a steady source of well-trained scientists and engineers in this critical area.  The establishment of the Center and the continuation of the AHPCRC Program was and shall continue to be the embod iment of the Army's support of the broader national effort to maintain U.S. leadership in computing technology and its application to issues critical to U.S. national security. While other HPC related initiatives funded by other agencies exist (i.e. the Na tional Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy, and other U.S. Department of Defense organizations), this Center is committed to insuring that the needs relevant to Army problems, in particular, are properly developed in predictable directions, witho ut waiting for initiatives which may be primarily driven by commercial or other federal or Defense needs.  Through the AHPCRC  Program, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) helps to stimulate and support the public purpose of furthering science in HPC a nd also helps fulfill the research and development goals of the Department of Army.  More information about the current Center and AHPCRC Program can be found at http://www.ahpcrc.org. A key to the success of the AHPCRC Program is the collaborative researc h environment established between Government, Academia, and Industry.  Under this collaborative research environment, basic research is conducted in computational sciences and engineering.  The research covers research areas related to computational scienc es and engineering, to include  interdisciplinary computational research (i.e. research involving more than one scientific discipline); and Scalable Algorithms and Software Technology. The objective of the basic research efforts include conducting innovati ve computational research in collaboration with Army scientists to accelerate the infusion of new technologies in support of Army Transformation; provide for the mutual exchange of researchers between the Army and the AHPCRC to facilitate the execution of joint research projects including the exploitation of high performance computing; and provide on- and off-site symposia and educational programs to increase awareness of this partnership program, to foster scientific interchange, and to facilitate transiti on of new technologies emerging as a result of this program to Army laboratories and development centers.  Early access HPC systems are acquired, maintained and exploited for computational sciences research.  This involves installing, integrating, operatin g and maintaining presently owned Government Furnished Property (GFP) at several sites and  identifying, acquiring, installing, integrating and operating new and/or emerging HPC resources.  All of these support efforts must be conducted in coordination wit h the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO) concerning HPC systems.   The availability and use of these HPC resources is both integral and critical to support the research being performed under the AHPCRC Program. The U. S. Army Resea rch Laboratory (ARL) is expecting to issue a Program Announcement (PA) to solicit proposals to continue the AHPCRC Program on or about 10 April 2006.  A similar notice will be posted at the time of the issuance of the PA.  Award will be made on the basis o f the best value to the Government.  The Government anticipates awarding one Cooperative Agreement (31 U.S.C. 6305) for the AHPCRC Program under the authority o f 10 U.S.C. 2358 to fulfill the needs of the AHPCRC Program.  In accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) that govern the use of Cooperative Agreements, Profit or Fee will be prohibited for the research efforts, i.e. all efforts th at are substantive to performance of the AHPCRC program.  However, certain aspects of the support of the HPC resources described above may be considered goods and services needed to carry out the AHPCRC Program; and thus, a profit or fee may be appropriate  to be paid for those goods or services.  The award is expected to provide for a basic performance period of five (5) years with one (1) optional five (5) year extension period, bringing the total performance period to a potential maximum of ten (10) years .  Interested Parties will be required to form a Consortium in order to respond to the Program Announcement. While the Consortium can be incorporated as a legal entity, there is no requirement for the Consortium to do so.  The Consortium will be required t o draft Articles of Collaboration that will address various internal operational aspects of the Consortium.  Proposals that do not include Articles of Collaboration signed by duly authorized representatives of each Consortium member will be considered non- responsive and the proposal will receive no further consideration for award. The Consortium must be capable of providing a research program over a five-year period with an option for an additional five-year period. Minimum Consortium Membership requirement s include a (1) an Academic Lead Member; (2) an Infrastructure and Administration Member; and (3) a Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) Member. Other members (both educational and industrial) may be added as necessary to  meet the goals of the AHPCRC Program.   The Academic Lead Member must be an accredited advanced degree (Ph. D.) granting U.S. educational institution noted for world-class research in interdisciplinary computational sciences, algorithms and software devel opment.  The Academic Lead Member is responsible for leading all of the research efforts of the Consortium, and managing transition, outreach and educational opportunities.  The Infrastructure and Administration Member can be an industrial concern or an ac ademic institution. The Infrastructure and Administration Member is responsible for acquiring, installing, operating, and managing HPC systems and housing a significant amount of the existing HPC resources.  They may also be involved in outreach and educat ional opportunities, as well as transitioning of the research results to Army scientists, and thus, the Infrastructure and Administration Member will be required to have Secret facility clearance.  Further, the Infrastructure and Administration Member will  be responsible for distributing the funding to the Consortium members based on the currently approved Program Plan of effort to be conducted under the cooperative agreement between the Army and the Consortium.  In addition, Infrastructure and Administrati on Member will be responsible for monitoring and processing disbursements through the Army.  Funding levels for the resultant Cooperative Agreement are subject to the availability of funds.  Three types of funding are expected to be provided for under the Cooperative Agreement, i.e.  (1) funding for basic research efforts; (2) funding for technology transition, educational opportunities, outreach and support of the HPC systems described above; and (3) funding for the acquisition of new HPC resources.  Two l evels of funding are identified for this program, based on current budget submissions and supplemental funding that historically has been received for this program.  Based on budget submissions, research efforts would be funded at an estimated value of $2, 000,000.00 per year, and efforts to operate and support the existing HPC resources of the program would be funded at an estimated value of $1,000,000.00 per yea r, over the potential ten year period of performance, with no budgeted funding for technology transition efforts or acquiring new HPC resources.  However, based on supplemental funding that has been historically received for the program, funding above the budget submission values described above is possible.  Additional funding for support of the HPC resources, technology transition, educational and outreach efforts, and management of the research program and the research partners is estimated at $15,000,00 0.00 per year, over the potential ten year period of performance.  With respect to supplemental funding that historically has been received for acquiring new HPC resources, the estimated total value is $30,0000,000.00 for the basic period of performance of  five years, and $30,000,000.00 for the optional additional five year period of performance.  Proposals submitted in response to the PA are expected to be provided at both funding levels listed above.   The Government expects the funding levels to fluctuat e over the period of performance and envisions adjusting the program goals to coincide with these fluctuations.  The Government will assess the progress of the research effort yearly. Exercise of the five-year option will be based on a comprehensive review  of technical performance, the availability of funds and Army needs. A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on Tuesday, 18 April 2006, at 9:00 am local time, in Minneapolis, MN at the current facility housing the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources being used to accomplish the AHPCRC Program.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide potential offerors an opportunity to view the existing HPC resources and the current infrastructure operations.  Information will also be provided concerning the Res earch and Transition efforts.  Potential offerors must pre-register with the Agreement Specialist, Debra Matthews, by  13 April 2006 in order to attend this Conference.  Ms. Matthews can be reached at 919-549-4385 or deb.matthews@us.army.mil.  The Conferen ce is expected to last no more than four hours.  Information presented at the Conference will be made available for those who would like to have a copy of this information and for those who are unable to attend.

<ARCHDATE>12302006

<DESC>DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGINEERING SERVICES (DICCE), DE-RP52-06NA26990.  Proposal Disallowed Reason: This is a sources sought announcement NOT a request for proposals. Description: The National Nuclear Security Administrationâ€™s Second Line of Defense (SLD) Program, which is overseen by the Office of International Materials Protection and Emergency Cooperation (NA-25), is seeking to identify qualified vendors for Design, Integration, Construction, Communications, and Engineering Services (DICCE).  These DICCE services include installation of radiation detection and communication equipment at international land border crossings, airports & seaports.  Related experience working and contracting in overseas locations is required. All work requires written agreements with the host Government.  Because agreements and future funding levels are not assured, it is difficult to accurately estimate the ultimate magnitude of the work. However, SLD expects that the DICCE services contractor will have to potentially support the installation of radiation detectors and communication equipment in over 30 mega-ports and up to two hundred transit locations in over 30 foreign countries over the next five years.  DICCE services may be required in up to ten countries concurrently with each location at a different stage in the implementation.  The level of effort and type of services may vary in each location. The program is considering several strategies for this work, including awarding separate contracts in functional areas of construction, communications, and maintenance work.  However, the program is also considering combining all requirements into one Statement of Work. Multiple awards may be made under either scenario. If multiple awards are made, the program may elect to award individual task orders based upon a competitive award among the awardees, regional expertise, and/or  contractor resources and availability.  In the event the program is able to obtain timely agreements in all planned locations and pursues a strategy that includes all services at each site, the rough order of magnitude for all work under this notice could be in the four to six hundred million dollar ($400 - $600M) range.  The Government makes no commitment or assurance that either the full magnitude of work will ultimately be ordered or that any of the approaches mentioned here will be pursued or employed. Notices to Vendors:  The SLD program is considering several strategies for this work, and therefore may pursue additional methods of identifying suitable approaches and qualified vendors for this work.  All interested parties are strongly encouraged to keep watching this site and this action.  All notices regarding this effort will be posted on DOE E-Center and on FedBizOpps. Services Sought: Design Services:  Provide complete and certified architectural and engineering design services. â€¢ Sensor systems â€“ nuclear radiation, video, motion, and security systems â€¢ Buildings and structures to house alarm station and emergency centers â€¢ Site access, boundary and perimeter control systems for seaports, airports, border crossings â€“ pedestrians, vehicles, and trains â€¢ Communication systems that include microwave, web based communications, fiber optics, cable and radio-frequency systems â€¢ Training centers, maintenance and repair facilities, and test beds Integration Services: â€¢ Coordinate with third parties and Government Furnished Equipment contractors on equipment specifications, deliveries, and installation requirements â€¢ Coordinate with host country representatives on design and construction activities to ensure a seamless implementation process â€¢ Ensure all construction and installation activities have been accomplished.

The data includes radiation monitor data, video and user data entries.  The systems may include intra-site communications between computing systems(s) and the sensor devises. The SLD architecture is made up of several system elements.  Not all ports or countries will require each of these elements and some elements may need to be modified to operate under site-specific conditions.  The elements may include: â€¢ Local Alarm Station (LAS) â€¢ Central Alarm Station (CAS) â€¢ Mother CAS  (connects two or more CASs) â€¢ Regional Center â€¢ National Center Engineering Services:  Provide specialized expertise and engineering services required for design and construction activities at SLD portal sites, and in support of SLD mission requirements.

<DESC>NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY TELEPHONE. ALL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO,  it-infrastructure@gsa.gov.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NO PURCHASE WILL RESULT FROM THIS ACTION. 
This is a summary of the Request for Information – IT Infrastructure Optimization Initiative. The complete document, containing Background, Instructions and the Questionnaire is attached to this page, and also available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/c-6-9-ioi.html.
The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeks information related to the IT Infrastructure Optimization Initiative (IOI). The objective is to further refine the opportunities for IT infrastructure consolidation and optimization, and develop government-wide common solutions. The IOI will define specific common performance measures for service levels and costs, identify best practices, and develop guidance for transition plans within agencies and/or across agencies. 
Consolidation and optimization of IT infrastructure represents a significant opportunity to realize future cost savings by taking a more coordinated approach to spending on commodity IT infrastructure. IT infrastructure consolidation and optimization case studies also demonstrate that agencies could improve IT service levels and, when relieved of the burden of managing these non-core functions, concentrate more on mission priorities and results.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The IT Infrastructure Optimization Task Force intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services. 
RFI Questionnaire Response
Responses to the RFI must be submitted by e-mail to GSA by 5:00 p.m. EDT, May 5th, 2006. In responding to the RFI, please use the template attached to this notice or from the URL provided above and place your responses in-line in the document, retaining the question number and question text before each answer. Your e-mail should be clearly marked in the subject line with reference to RFI-GSV06PD00088 and your organization. Please include a point of contact your organization and e-mail your response in Word (version 2000 or higher) to it-infrastructure@gsa.gov. 
The Government recognizes that respondents may have information pertaining to only some infrastructure areas. Limited, “best of breed”, information can still be of high quality and significant value to the ultimate common solution(s) for the IOI. Therefore, while the government seeks to define common solutions that address the entire IOI, it does not discourage partial responses. If you choose not to respond to a question, indicate “no response” and identify the rationale. No more than 20 additional single-sided pages with print no smaller than 11 point is suggested; however, text included in graphics, tables, and figures can be smaller than 10 point. The submissions must be in sufficient detail and clarity to provide the information needed to assess your solution approach. Please do not include marketing materials with your response at this time and ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. The government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services. 
Invitation to Practitioners Day
Respondents are invited to attend the Infrastructure Optimization Initiative Practitioners Day for Government, Industry, Non-profit organizations and other stakeholders. The IOI Managing Partner and representatives from OMB and the PMO will be present to discuss the LoB.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeks information related to Federal-wide geospatial data and capabilities. The objective is to further refine the opportunities for optimizing and consolidating Federal geospatial-related investments to reduce the cost of government and, at the same time, improve services to citizens. 
Cross-agency coordination of geospatial activities can identify, consolidate, and reduce or eliminate redundant geospatial investments. Developing the Geospatial Line of Business (LoB) will result in a more coordinated approach to producing, maintaining, and using geospatial data, and will ensure sustainable participation from Federal partners to establish a collaborative model for geospatial-related activities and investments. In addition, optimization and consolidation of geospatial activities offers an opportunity to realize future cost savings and new ways of doing business by taking a more coordinated approach to spending.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE).  TSA’s OSHE seeks statements of capabilities from all interested companies in performing tasks related to its Voluntarily Abandoned Property (VAP) management and disposal program.  This sources sought notice does not represent a formal solicitation.  TSA will use information received in response to this sources sought in deciding its course of action moving forward.  Businesses of any size may respond to this sources sought notice.  Though TSA desires to select a Contractor to manage the VAP program, TSA reserves the right to not to issue a solicitation or award any contract as a result of this sources sought notice.   

Background:   

Prior to passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Pub.L. 107 71, the air carriers were responsible for the screening of commercial air carrier passengers.  They also were responsible for the collection and disposition of all prohibited items, including hazardous materials.  With the passage of ATSA, TSA became responsible for the screening of these passengers.  49 U.S.C. §44901(a).  

As a result, TSA determined that it had the legal responsibility to accept prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  Having accepted the property, TSA is legally liable for the disposition of abandoned or forfeited personal property.  Hazardous materials, if not otherwise donated per 41 CFR 101-42.304, must be disposed of in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.  42 U.S.C. §6901 et seq.

In 2003, TSA issued the National Voluntarily Abandoned Property and Hazardous Material Disposal Contract to assist with the management, disposition and disposal of the prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  In April 2005, TSA added lighters to the prohibited item list as directed by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  Since adding lighters to the prohibited items list, the amount of hazardous material abandoned at TSA screening checkpoint has nearly quadrupled.  

TSA did not anticipate the volume of lighters being abandoned at the checkpoint to remain at such a high level.  

Goals:  

It is TSA’s goal through this sources sought notice to gauge interest and depth of market for private Contractors to manage and dispose of VAP for the agency.  All airports in the Continental United States (CONUS), as well as those in Alaska, Hawaii, and all U.S. territories in Puerto Rico, the South Pacific and the U.S. Virgin Islands generate VAP that must be collected, properly catalogued on a manifest and disposed of in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.  While airports are the primary requirement, all TSA locations, including TSA Headquarters and other field offices within CONUS are also subject to the requirement.  Additionally, while a current listing of TSA locations and Federalized airports is available, this list is subject to change as new airports come on line, office locations change, DHS reorganizes and brings in new entities and airports change size and category.  

While TSA has Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place for the management and disposal of VAP the agency is interested in any new or innovative approaches that may be presented.  Interested firms are cautioned, however, that any solution must be strictly in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local guidelines, including Federal Property Management regulations, EPA standards, DOT standards and State Environmental regulations.  Additionally, there are reporting fees and other charges levied by various state and federal agencies.  While TSA contemplates funding for these would be included in a contract should one arise, it also contemplates the actual payment and coordination of these fees would be done by the Contractor.  Finally, TSA anticipates continuing its current arrangement in which the Contractor managing and disposing of VAP indemnifies the Government from harm in performance of the contract (see the draft Statement of Work for more details on this indemnification).     

Draft Statement of Work (SOW):  

All vendors are cautioned that the SOW is a draft and that any SOW accompanying any solicitation that results from information received in response to this Sources Sought notice and other TSA research and requirements definition may contain some changes from the draft.  

If Interested:  

All interested vendors must contact TSA’s Office of Acquisition (OA) for a copy of the draft Statement of Work (SOW) list of federalized airports and other facilities and submit a capability statement in response to that draft SOW.  This statement should be in electronic format (most preferably MS Word, MS Powerpoint or PDF) and should clearly explain what resources are at the Contractor’s disposal that would allow it to efficiently and effectively manage and dispose of VAP.  Firms should also indicate whether or not their capabilities are more suited to prime work or subcontractor work on this requirement.  TSA’s point of contact is Mr. Mark Urciuolo, who can be reached via phone at 571-227-4213 or via e-mail at mark.urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov.  If Mark Urciuolo is unavailable then interested parties may also contact Mr. Marvin Grubbs via phone at 571-227-1581 or via e-mail at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov.  Any questions about this sources sought should be directed to Mark Urciuolo or Marvin Grubbs.  All interested Contractors must provide TSA with a capability statement in electronic format through the designated point of contact no later than 12 noon Eastern time on Thursday April 27th, 2006.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, CA, is seeking sources for an optical payload interface Box with the following capabilities:Remote control capability of some of our KTM tracking mounts should become a reality with the integration, testing and acceptance of the refurbished units equipped with Digital Control Systems. To provide the same remote control capabilities to our current Davro and Pelco lens systems, an I/O device will be required to accept operator inputs (switch closures or control voltages from the Pelco lends control unit). Convert this to an RS232 serial stream, transport it via fiber optic communication equipment, and reconvert it to voltages or relay closures at the KTM electronics bay. The purpose of this document is to outline the technical requirements of the necessary I/O device and provide a high-level block diagram of its integration into the system. 
Requirements: The requirement below will specify what is necessary to implement basic functions of our lenses (Focus, Iris and Zoom) for the purpose Video Bomb Scoring and Flight Vision support.
General Requirements: All I/O units must be mountable in a standard 19-inch equipment rack and be equipped with suitable rack slides; All connectors/hardware used in the construction of the units will be readily-available from multiple sources (COTS) to facilitate maintenance, interfacing and repair; Unit will be able to operate in temperatures as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit
Unit will operate on 115 VAC, 60 hertz power.  Technical Requirements: Once fielded for use, the unit will operate independently of all other computing and data processing devices or programs (i.e. it will not require external computer or software interfacing to perform its function). Programming and/or diagnostic functions done by the vendor via a computer interface are obviously permitted. User inputs to the master I/O device (at the operations console) will be grouped with a single connector for each lends controlled (for example: one connector to accept inputs for Lens A, one for Lens B), with no slitting up of lens function inputs between multiple connectors. Outputs of the slave I/O device (at the destination end) will similarly be grouped with a single connector for each lens controlled.
Master and slave units will communicate via an RS232 serial connection, in accordance with applicable standards.
Inputs to Master Unit (operations console) will meet following specifications: Switch closure type: Two connectors with 8 switch-closure-to-ground inputs each, which activate corresponding relays in the Slave Unit. (These inputs will come from a customer-supplied lens control box by means of DPDT (on) off (on) momentary toggle switches. Relays at the Slave unit will be N.O. until a switch closure to ground is completed at the control box. Voltage/switch closure combo: One connector which will accept 0vdc to +/- 12vdc to ground on 3 input lines (depending on potentiometer setting from customer-supplied control box). These inputs will be converted to digital via ADC and then reconverted via DAC at the Slave Unit to drive lends functions. This input connector will also provide two switch-closer-to-ground inputs, to activate N.O. relays at the Slave Unit. There will be a total of 6 input lines, including common (ground). Outputs from Slave Unit (tracker electronics bay) will meet the following specifications: Switch closure type: Relay closures in response to corresponding Master unit switch inputs shall be rated for 1 amp, 5vdc. They will be N.O. until switch closure is detected. When switch closure is released, they will return to N.O. condition. Voltage/switch closure combo: Relay closures for this connector will meet the same requirements as above. DACs and their associated amplifiers shall provide up to 300 mA at 12vdc (max), depending upon the corresponding voltage input at the Master Unit, for each output line to the lens.
The NAICS Code is  333314.  This posting is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum: evidence of past experience; related projects and/or existing systems, etc; and business size.  Interested parties need to identify if they fall into one of the following categories:  large business, small business, hub zone small business, veteran owned small business, woman owned small business, or small disadvantaged business.  All respondents that can provide any of the requested information should reply to Jonathan Denning at the following email address:  jonathan.denning@edwards.af.mil or by mail to 412 TW/ENRB, 306 E Popson Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL  

The National Information Technology Center (NITC) provides hosting services and solutions for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other non-USDA customers.  The NITC requests information from federal and commercial vendors about facilities capable of supporting Government data center disaster recovery operations.  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended solely to assist the NITC in analyzing alternatives and options in the area of information technology disaster recovery.

1.1 Overview

The NITC is a part of USDA's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  The mission of NITC is to enable Government agencies to achieve their missions by providing innovative, cost effective, and secure information technology solutions.   The NITC provides information management services and technology to support the missions of the USDA and its agencies (including Farm Service Agency (FSA), Rural Development (RD), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service (FS), and others), and other non-USDA Government clients [including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and General Services Administration (GSA)].  The NITC headquarters is located in Kansas City, Missouri, with employees also stationed in Fort Collins, Colorado, and the Washington D.C. area.  The NITC is a centralized computing facility of mainframe and mid-range platforms, software and support.  NITC customers access their services from remote locations throughout the continental United States via private and public networks.  The applications that run in the NITC environment are national in scope and importance, directly serving approximately 125,000 end users.  The NITC works closely with customers to provide the technical resources, the expertise and the processing environments critical to the success of their applications.  For more information on NITC, see www.ocio.usda.gov/nitc/index.html.  

1.2 Background

The NITC is researching the feasibility of establishing a secure and expandable Disaster Recovery Site.  The NITC hosts and supports a wide spectrum of mission critical applications in its data center environments.  In order to be responsive to its customers’ needs in the area of Disaster Recovery, the NITC must consider new approaches for recovering its complex, multi-platform workload.

1.3 Objective

The NITC seeks to identify Level IV security rated facilities with an infrastructure designed to support a multi-platform information technology environment.  At a potential facility, the NITC would house and manage computer equipment supporting NITC customers if/when the NITC’s Kansas City, Missouri primary facility is disabled.  The potential environment would need to be continuously available for NITC operations. Initially the NITC would conduct both scheduled and unannounced disaster recovery exercises at this facility.

2.0 Environment

The NITC's primary data center is located at 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Missouri 64114-3363.  The NITC currently contracts disaster recovery services from the IBM Business Continuity and Recovery Services Center in Boulder, Colorado.

The NITC has custodial responsibility for the equipment housed at its facilities; therefore, physical and personnel security practices are a NITC priority.  The NITC must also respond quickly to its customers' changing needs and priorities.  For purposes of this RFI, the NITC would remotely manage equipment at the potential disaster recovery site location, but would also need limited operational support (tape technicians, security escorts for service engineers, etc.) whenever physical intervention or interface is needed.

3.0 Request for Information

The NITC requests technical information and general cost estimates regarding the respondent's ability to provide a computer facility and described support services.

3.1 Response Instructions

Please submit your responses in electronic format utilizing this MS Word document in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. (Microsoft Word 2002 or later, font Times New Roman 12, color blue) to Mr. Scott C. Wolz, Contracting Officer, e-mail address scott.wolz@usda.gov, and cc:  NITC Lead Systems Analyst, Mr. Philip Gehrt, e-mail address Philip.Gehrt@usda.gov, by close of business Friday, April 28, 2006. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

Although responses should be concise and complete, additional supporting information in electronic format is allowed, up to a 10-page maximum, not including the questionnaire responses.  Please do not provide brochures or other prepared marketing materials.  Please include your organization name and RFI number (from title page) on all submitted documentation.  All data designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.  

The NITC is looking for input to assist in moving forward with a cost effective solution for its customers.  Therefore, it is important that your response addresses the specific requirements included in this document, pricing estimates, and any other relevant information or capabilities that would support or enhance the NITC's analysis.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Integrated Deepwater Systems Project Office as a means of market research regarding the state of the market for proven (e.g. in service) patrol boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information.  This RFI will assist in programmatic decisions regarding options to address the urgent need for patrol boat capability, and the replacement of the forty-nine (49) existing Island Class patrol boats with minimal developmental and programmatic risk.  This RFI seeks principal patrol boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements without significant development (e.g. as parent craft design or as a variant of the parent craft).   Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel is capable of being licensed in the US.  New and unproven (not in service) designs are not of interest in this request and will not be reviewed.  

The Patrol boat’s missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore).  The Patrol Boat will typically entail near-shore fisheries protection, choke-point interdiction, barrier patrols, search and rescue operations and command presence in areas of distress.  When deployed, operations will generally take place within 300 nautical miles of homeport or advance shore base. 

To better define what the USCG desires in a Parent Craft, the top level requirements for the planned Patrol Boat Replacement Project (Fast Response Cutter) are identified in section I of the attachment.

I2WD is collecting information on proven sensor technologies to achieve the Phase I I objectives proposed in the Suite of Sense Through The Wall (STTW) Systems ATO.  The government reserves the right to request formal proposals based on white paper submissions that meet evaluation criteria and submission requirements. 1	INTRODUCTION As military operations become increasingly urban centric, our ability to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance on combatants is severely hindered as they retreat indoors.  Current technologies do not provide the Soldier with the capability to locate thes e potential adversaries within buildings or determine which building should be considered primary targets.  As a result, the Army is committed to provide the Soldier with the capability to locate potential hostile targets deep inside urban structures as we ll as give structural information on these buildings such as floor plan information (i.e. walls, doorways, windows). Deploying Sense Through the Wall technologies can be thought of as a multiple phase operation.  Initial reconnaissance with a long range vehicle mounted sensor/s can determine which structures may require greater analysis.  At this time, no target or struc tural information would be required other than a determination that there are probable adversaries within a structure.  Once a building is marked as priority, the clearing force can decide to deploy shorter range SUGV based sensor/s or Soldier-borne sens or/s.  Both variants will be able to provide information that is much more detailed than the longer range sensors, especially in regards to adversary numbers and locations and if armed or not. The Suite of STTW Systems ATO will provide mounted/dismounted Soldiers with the capability to detect, locate, and see personnel with or without concealed weapons and explosives (CW and CE) which are hidden behind walls, doors and other obstructions.  Thi s addendum addresses Phase II of a two-phased ATO with technology demonstrator deliveries in 3QFY08 though it will not exclude the possibility of earlier spiral insertions. The contractor will design, develop, fabricate and test STTW technology demonstrators that meet the requirements specified in the draft STTW Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the Future Combat System (FCS) Operational Requirements Document (ORD).   Critical extracts of the STTW CDD and the FCS ORD are listed in the Technology demonstrator Performance Goals section of this document.  It is anticipated that one version will be Soldier Borne (SB), and modular in design for potential integration into  an FCS Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV).  A second set of payloads will be mounted on a larger Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and will have increased standoff distance from the target area.   1.1	Definitions Battery Life: The time from when the system is initially powered up and operating until the battery is fully discharged. Time to Acquire Sensor Display: The time from when the system is turned on until the initial reading is displayed (for remote systems with PCs, the OS boot time is not counted). Display Update Rate: The time interval from the display of a set of processed sensor information to the next. True Positive: Is defined as one target icon represented on the GUI per actual target present within the sensors field of view.  Target acquisition must meet requirements for time to acquire and update (2.1.3). False Positive: Is defined as one target icon represented on the GUI when no target is present within the sensors field of view.  A false positive can also occur when more target icons appear on the GUI then are actually within the sensors field of v iew. True Negative: Is defined as no target icons represented on the GUI when no targets are present within the sensors field of view.  False Negative: Is defined as no target icons represented on the GUI when target(s) are present within the sensors field of view.  A false negative can also occur when more targets are present within the field of view then are represented on the GUI.  F alse negatives must meet the requirements of multiple target discrimination (2.1.8)  Probability of Detection: Is defined by the ratio of trials with true positives versus the total number of trials with true positives and false negatives. Probability of False Alarm: Is defined as the ratio of trials with true negatives versus the total number of trials with true negatives and false positives.   Target: Can be a person, concealed weapons, concealed explosives or person with concealed weapons and/or explosives. On-the-Move: Sensors shall be able to operate and obtain accurate information while in continuous motion at typical operational tempo, unless otherwise specified Ad-Hoc Network: A network of sensors shall have the ability to be added and dropped from the network automatically without requiring configuration on the fly. Self Locating Sensors: A network of sensors shall have the ability to operate cooperatively in a wireless manner without precise placement.  If alignment is required, an automated/assisted alignment system is preferable to manual alignment with minimal tim e for setup. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6: System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in relevant environment.  Representative model or prototype system is well beyond that of a breadboard.  Additional information on TRLs can be found on p34-38 of the Tec hnology Readiness Assessment Deskbook (http://www.defenselink.mil/ddre/doc/tra_deskbook_2005.pdf) 2	ATO PHASE II: Advanced Technology Demonstrator Development  Phase II of the ATO will develop operational technology demonstrator sensor systems that could possibly be transitioned to appropriate Program Managers.  These technology demonstrators shall be at a TRL6 by the end of this effort in 3QFY08 or earlier for p ossible spiral insertion as part of Quick Reaction Capabilities.  If the system consists of multiple sensors, they shall be able to perform wirelessly in an ad-hoc network and  sensors shall be self-locating.  Below are the goals for Phase II of the ATO and shall be met by the conclusion of this effort.  These requirements are not listed in order of importance and shall be treated equally. 2.1	Phase II Technology Demonstrator Performance Goals  NOTE: The proposer must provide sufficient information supporting proposed specifications.  Proposers shall be aware that systems will have to comply with FCC, NTIA, Army Spectrum Management, etc. regulations for obtaining spectrum approval.  For the purpo ses of this white paper, the proposer should assume the STTW payloads will be integrated with PackBot (by iRobot) and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) (Model M1097A) in lieu of the FCS SUGV and USAICs UGV per the draft Capabilities Deve lopment Document (CDD), respectively.  A PackBot and HMMWV will be provided to the STTW technology demonstrator contractor(s) as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). 2.1.1	STTW Technology Demonstrator Weights: "	SB technology demonstrator weight goal: less than or equal to 3 lbs(O)/less than or equal to 6lbs(T) (including battery)  o	Technology demonstrators with weights higher than the above mentioned requirements may still be considered if significant advancements can be made in sensor range, Pd, and Pf "	SUGV technology demonstrator payload weight goal: 6 lbs (including mounting arm/bracket and battery if host 2W power not used) "	UGV technology demonstrator payload weight goal: less than or equal to 50lbs(O)/less than or equal to 150lbs(T) for each payload 2.1.2	Battery Life: Minimum of 4 hours for the SB and SUGV mounted system.  UGV mounted systems will utilize the host platforms prime power (28VDC) to supply power for the STTW payload. 2.1.3	Time to acquire sensor reading and display information to operator:  less than 5 sec for all payloads with an update of previously detected targets every 1 sec. 2.1.4	Probability of Detection: The Pd goal for Phase I for SB and UGV mounted payloads was 85%.  Phase II is looking for a significant improvement on this Phase I goal.   Since the SUGV Pd is part of a classified requirement, provide an estimate of the an ticipated Pd for the proposed SUGV system. NOTE:  Some of the specifications for the SUGV mounted STTW systems have been classified by the FCS ORD.  These specifications are not included here and will not be provided to the proposer.  The proposers should provide their best estimates of the perform ance characteristics that they feel are achievable for the technology demonstrator STTW payload for the SUGV. 2.1.5	Probability of False Alarm: The Pfa goals for phase I were less than or equal to 15% for all STTW payloads.  Phase II is looking for a significant improvement on this Phase I goal. 2.1.6	Sensor range to target (regardless of wall location between sensor and target):  "	The Phase I SB range goal (for personnel detection only) was 20 meters.  The Phase II SB technology demonstrator (detect personnel w/ CE/CW through walls) is looking for a significant improvement on this Phase I goal.  "	Since the SUGV range is part of a classified requirement, provide an estimate of the anticipated range for the proposed SUGV mounted technology demonstrator (detect personnel w/ CE/CW through walls). "	The Phase I UGV range goal was 100 meters.  The Phase II UGV mounted technology demonstrator (detect personnel w/ CE/CW through walls) is looking for a significant improvement on this Phase I goal. 2.1.7	Detect and recognize targets through multiple wall types in the presence of clutter.  Detect the possibilities of weapons caches either stored within the building in question as well as explosives hidden in walls, below floors or otherwise concealed within the building structure itself.  The STTW payloads must be able to penetrate 12 non-metallic walls such as cement block, dry wall, adobe, brick, and reinforced concrete. 2.1.8	Discrimination of multiple targets.  The STTW payl oads must be able to discriminate multiple targets separated by greater than or equal to 1 meter (SB and SUGV mounted technology demonstrators) or greater than or equal to 3 meters (UGV mounted technology demonstrators) for all targets within the systems range. 2.1.9	Location accuracy.  The STTW payloads must be able to locate targets within less than or equal to 1 meter (SB mounted technology demonstrators), XXm (SUGV mounted technology demonstrators) or less than or equal to 3 meters (UGV mounted technology dem onstrators) of their actual locations for all targets within the systems range. NOTE:  Some of the specifications for the SUGV mounted STTW systems have been classified by the FCS ORD.  These specifications are not included here and will not be provided to the proposer.  The proposers should provide their best estimates of the perform ance characteristics that they feel are achievable for the technology demonstrator STTW payload for the SUGV. 2.1.10	Simultaneous detection of near stationary (breathing) targets and targets in motion  2.1.11	User-friendly interface (i.e., alerts to cue user to look at display) 2.1.12	Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) (i.e., icon displays for detected targets and stationary structural features with geo-location information) 2.1.13	Motion compensation algorithms for operator/platform induced movement and On-the-Move operations 2.1.14	Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) compatibility with fielded sensors and communications devices (e.g. GPS, SATCOM equipment, etc.) operating within radius of  10 meters of the STTW payloads 2.1.15	Demonstrate data dissemination from the STTW SUGV and UGV payload via secure wireless communications to a remote operator located 300 meters away (line of sight).  Surrogate communications shall be Ethernet or USB based protocols and be limited to 1  MB/s or less. 2.1.16 SB, SUGV and UGV prototype platforms shall be designed to withstand a drop from 1 meter on to hard pack earth without impacting performance.  Technology Demonstrator systems shall also be sufficiently ruggedized for operation in MIL-STD-810F climati c design types hot, basic hot and basic cold.  The system shall survive the same environment an operator can be expected to survive.  Environments include smoke, aerosols, fog, rain, dust, wind, snow, icing, biological, and chemical. 2.1.17  Mapping of exterior & interior walls and significant stationary objects 2.2	Phase II Test and Demonstration  STTW sensors shall be tested at a Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) facility, assume Fort Benning, GA or Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG), AZ during 4QFY08.  Technology Demonstrators shall be at a Technology Readiness Level 6  and budget a total of fo ur weeks to complete testing. 2.3	Phase II Deliverables If selected for a phase II development contract, the vendor shall deliver the following items: "	Monthly Activity Reports: Due two weeks before the end of every month throughout the duration of the program.  The reports shall discuss major accomplishment, significant activities, important difficulties, schedules and budgeting "	Specifications Document: This document shall outline all projected goals for the developed hardware as they relate to the requirements of the ATO Phase II "	Preliminary Design Review Briefing: This briefing shall be provided during the Preliminary Design Review meeting "	Critical Design Review Briefing: This briefing shall be provided during the Critical Design Review meeting "	Test Plan:  A test plan shall be provided to the Government that addresses how the system will be tested in order to insure it meets the corresponding specifications document "	Training Documentation: Documentation shall be provided that instructs the user on how to effectively operate the system "	Technology Demonstrators: Due NLT 3QFY08 o	SB technology demonstrator (detect personnel w/ CE/CW through walls) Qty: 3 each o	SUGV mounted technology demonstrator (detect perso nnel w/ CE/CW through walls) Qty: 3 each o	UGV mounted technology demonstrator (detect personnel w/ CE/CW through walls with increased standoff distance from target area) Qty: 3 each 3	TEAMING Due to the multiple discipline nature of this program, teaming is encouraged.  Providing a technology that both detects and locates both personnel and concealed weapons and explosives is the goal in this phase of the ATO.  Proposals that do not address bot h these goals are not as likely to be selected.  Time will be set aside at the I2WD Industry Day to allow participants to interact and possibly form partnering relationships.  The vendors will be informed of the date and location of the Industry Day as soo n as the information is available. 4	SECURITY  Proposers who choose to submit a response for the SUGV mounted version are required to assign personnel to this task that can obtain and maintain a SECRET security clearance.  All work must be performed at a cleared facility, if selected for proposal resul ting on contract award 5	SUBMISSIONS 5.1	White Paper Criteria At this point in the selection process, the proposer may submit a response for each Phase II deliverable; therefore, up to three (3) responses may be submitted  one for the Soldier Borne version, one for an SUGV mounted version, and/or one for an UGV moun ted versions. The response should describe the technical approach (and phenomenology) proposed by the proposer, the ATO objectives being addressed by the technology/technologies (the proposer may elect to respond to all or a portion of the ATO performance goals), projec ted performance capabilities (technical backing shall be provided for projected capabilities), technical risks and planned mitigation efforts, and clearly define the final technology demonstrator deliverable suitable for testing in a field environment.

If any Government contractors are used during any part of evaluation process, they will be asked to sign non-disclosure agre ements as part of the process.  Any information that is not intended for unlimited release shall be clearly marked prior to submission of the white paper. 6.2	White Paper Evaluation Criteria All papers will be evaluated against the following criteria: "	Scientific and Technical Merit/Understanding of the Problem o	The proposer will be evaluated on whether the proposal encompasses all aspects of STTW program.  The proposer must show a clear understanding of the goals and convey how their system will be operated in a tactical scenario.  Simply describing the technol ogy being implemented is not sufficient.  Frequency usage, power levels, conceptual designs and concept of operations are just a few elements that should be considered. If the final product is not tactically feasible, it will not be addressed. "	Previous Work o	Due to the aggressive schedule of this program and need for advanced technology demonstrators, the proposer must be able to exhibit substantial previous efforts in this field.  Proposals that do not describe any previous efforts will be considered, but i t is highly desired that the vendor show some previous work related to this program. 6.3	Proposal Submission The white paper phase will allow I2WD to gather a very broad amount of information before vendors put forth significant effort into developing a full proposal.  On or about 30 June 2006, vendors will be informed whether or not I2WD has invited them to subm it a full proposal.  The guidelines for developing a full proposal will be provided at that time.  As part of the final source selection process, I2WD will request that selected vendors participate in a one on one session of approximately 1-2 hours.  Vendo rs will provide I2WD with an overview of the proposal as well as a short demonstration of current STTW hardware.  This event will help I2WD to gauge the maturity and potential risks of the proposers current technology.  This event will be held in a TBD lo cation in the Eatontown, NJ area on or about the week of 14 August 2006.  Since it may not be feasible for all vendors to bring current hardware (i.e. large vehicular mounted equipment) I2WD will accommodate viewing of video files.   7	SCHEDULE SUMMARY With the exception of the white paper submission deadline, the dates that have been laid out in this request for white papers are tentative and may be subject to change.  Should these dates change, interested proposers will be notified.

<CONTACT>sharon evans, (502) 315-6187
<DESC>A MARKET SURVEY is being conducted to determine if there are any qualified contractors capable of providing the proposed contract services.    Air Mobility Command (AMC) at Scott Air Force Base has a requirement to improve their capability to generat e accurate construction cost estimates and project schedules for construction projects from the initial programming phase through design changes during construction.  Using traditional cost estimating development techniques that rely heavily on historical data and rules of thumb, AMC currently has limited capability to accurately program new projects, and to estimate the time and cost for completing construction projects.   With budget resources being ever increasingly limited, there is an increased emphasi s on being able to deliver completed projects on time and within the budget.    One key capability required is the ability to model the schedule and cost variability of construction projects in detail.  There are numerous complex variables that affect a projects schedule and cost, some of which include availability of specific local trades, productivity of the local labor pool, access to the project site, site management requirements, local availability of materials, and other peculiar local site characteristics.     Another key capability is to readily conduct what-if analyses and co st/schedule tradeoff analyses for different design and building material alternatives.  And taking into consideration all the significant variables, determine the projects construction schedule and cost for each of these alternatives.  Cost estimates are required to use pricing that is derived directly from the local market where the proposed project will be built, and not to rely wholly on historical databases that may not be current with current local market conditions.    Project schedules are required to be resourced loaded with values assigned for specific trades, materials, and equipment resources for each schedule activity.    Cost estimates and associated project schedules should be integral to one another with respect to each modeled scenario.   The Governments intention is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for providing the above described service.   Potential construction projects will be located at various Air Force installations under AMCs responsibility wit hin the United States. NAICS is 541611.  All interested contractor's businesses should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by Apr 18, 2006, 2:00 pm, local time.  Responses should include: (1) If the company is certified by the Small Business Administration as a HUBZone,  8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, or if the company does not have any of these certifications, (2) Past Experience- Describe experience in providing similar service, (3) Describe the approach on providing this proposed service, and (4) a stat ement of which portion of the work that will be self performed, and how it will be accomplished.  Send responses to the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, 600 Dr. M.L. King, Jr. Place, Room 821, ATTN:  Sharon Evans, Louisville, Kentucky  4 0202-2230 or by fax to (502)315-6194.

<SUBJECT>Command and Control Information Management (CCIM) Support
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC SD) requires systems engineering, integration, testing, training, prototype development/installation, experimentation, data collection, and analysis and security certification for support of the Command and Control Information Management project. The proposed contract action is for 1 base year (12 months) and 2 one-year options.  The intended contract number is N66001-06-D-0094.  The total estimated amount of this action is NTE $3 Million, including Options. The Government intends to award a sole-source cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract to AUSGAR Technologies for this effort. This support is urgently needed to continue the certification of the Command and Control Information Management (CCIM) project, and to getting Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) Cross Domain Solution (CDS) approved for a wired and wireless environment.  This is a one-time procurement, with no anticipated follow-on effort required. AUSGAR, a Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), is uniquely qualified to perform this effort. AUSGAR is uniquely qualified in the integration, test of the CCIM project, and has supported the initial development of documents necessary for the DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSA WG) SABI CDS approval process.  AUSGAR has the necessary expertise to support the necessary efforts of this requested action that includes NSA Information System Security Engineering Professional (NSA ISSEP), NSA Information Security Professional, Microsoft Certified Personnel, CISCO Certified Professional and Certified Information System Security Professionals (CISSP)-certified engineers.   AUSGAR has put together a prototype that consists of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) Hardware and Software they have exclusive distribution rights.  AUSGAR has developed the prototype, configured the software components that would allow others to utilize the prototype without dealing with the proprietary software interfaces that they have developed with their manufacture partners so others could install and run C2 applications over this secured wired or wireless communication capability.   AUSGAR being the developer possesses the unique component-integration knowledge required to quickly finalize the prototype, allow for SSC SD to integrate other applications to utilize this prototype to evaluate the ability of using a secured wireless communication capability and obtain warfighter feedback and continue to support the necessary security certification process. AUSGARâ€™s knowledge of how the prototype system was assembled will also assist in SSC-SD documenting the final prototype capability with SSC-SD developed applications running over this integrated system. Questions concerning this effort should be addressed to jesse.a.martinez@navy.mil (619)553-5717.

This requirement is for the Oklahoma City – Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. A single Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order will be awarded. Please include all requirements on quotations.  All CLINs specify Brand Name requirements. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, applies to this acquisition. Evaluation is based on lowest cost to the Government. The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  In addition to the guidance contained in FAR 52.212-4, contractors shall submit proof of delivery with their invoices.  Proof of delivery may be in the form of a bill of lading or other shipping document signed by the receiving office.  Invoices received without proof of delivery will not be accepted.  

The Brand Name Justification is as follows: 

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented through Section 201,  Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501), and FAR 6.302-1(c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Depot maintenance responsibility for the B-2 Spirit is performed and managed at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. The B-2 Spirit’s operational and flight capabilities are totally dependent on software programs. The Client’s organization and laboratory utilizes a large, integrated system of commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software products to develop, test, maintain, and update software specifically tailored to the needs of the B-2 Spirit.  
Pre-solicitation market research conducted by the Contract Specialist confirmed the validity of the Client’s request for the Motorola-branded hardware requirement. In addition, the Contracting Officer concurs with the Client’s argument that introduction of non-specified hardware elements into the integrated system would be cost-prohibitive, adversely impact support activities, and create testing inconsistencies, suspect software validations, and unacceptable flight safety conditions.  

The GSA Region 6 Final Invoice and Release of Claims Procedure is as follows:

(a) Unless otherwise specified, original invoices shall be submitted to the designated billing address. In addition to invoice requirements already specified, one additional invoice is to be submitted to the designated Project Manager as designated by the task or order.  The following information must be included on the invoice:

(1) 	Name of the business concern and invoice date.  The “remit to” address must correspond to the payment address in the contract;
(2) 	Contract number; and 
(3) 	Delivery order number, if applicable, or other authorization for delivery of property or services.

(b) The Project’s Requisition / Accounting Control Transaction (ACT) number, (to be provided at time of award), must appear on the face of the Invoice.  

(c) In addition to the requirements for a proper invoice specified in this contract or order, the following information or documentation must be submitted with the final invoice:  GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims.  With submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a release of all claims on GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims (required only on final payments) against the Government relating to this contract.  It shall state “NONE” unless the contractor has claims in stated amounts that are specifically excepted by the Contractor from the release.  If a proper Release of Claims fails to accompany the Contractor’s request for final payment, the Government will return the invoice to the contractor within seven days after its receipt, without action.  

(d) Final Payment.  The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under this contract after--  
	(1) 	Completion and acceptance of invoiced work;  
	(2) 	Presentation of a properly executed voucher; and 
	(3) 	Presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated amounts, that the Contractor has specifically excepted from the operation of the release.

(M) Greater Baltimore–Washington, D.C. metropolitan area - Students are designated as “LEAD Fellows” and are assigned for duty at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) in Annapolis, Maryland. The graduate education must be completed in the greater Baltimore-Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. 

(P) The program should capitalize on educational opportunities (e.g., academic field trips, site visits, access to senior governmental, military, and private sector officials, etc.) endemic to the greater metropolitan Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area. 

(M) Cohort based education - Approximately 15-25 students (i.e., Junior Officers) complete all phases of the program as a cohort. 

(M) Cohort recruitment, selection, and composition - The LEAD cohort represents the finest Junior Officers from the Navy and Marine Corps, and selection is highly competitive. Cohort membership will be determined by USNA and will be based on a broad range of selection criteria, including performance as a Junior Officer, potential for continued future service, and undergraduate academic performance. 

(M&P) Rich graduate education experience - The LEAD Program is typical of resident ‘gold standard’ graduate education, master’s degree producing programs, to include the next four items: 

(1)(P) University campus setting - approximately 40 – 60% of the cohort’s education will occur at a university campus setting. 

(2)(M) Accessible professors. 

(3)(M) Availability of university academic, educational, and computational resources. 

(4)(M) This is not a distance education program.

USNA will not incur per diem, travel, lodging, or other miscellaneous or reimbursable costs associated with delivery of the educational product. 

(M) Minimize costs - Programmatic costs will be mitigated but not at the expense of educational quality. Quality and cost both matter. Reduced tuition costs are expected to accrue because of the cohort-based, annually renewable nature of the program. 

(M) Company Officer indoctrination and training session Approximately one-week at the end of the one-year program will be dedicated to formal Company Officer indoctrination and training. This training will serve to facilitate the LEAD graduates’ transition to new duties as Company Officers. USNA is responsible for execution of this phase of the program. Proper coordination between USNA and any contracted university is necessary for scheduling and execution of the training.

The Government has divided the order into product groups described below and reserves the right to not award some groups or to make multiple awards. BACKGROUND North Cascades National Park Service (NPS) Complex maintains a widespread trail system for hikers and horsepackers.  The system includes several timber-framed suspension bridges.  The ~250' long Diablo suspension bridge is due for cyclic maintenance, to be performed by NPS employees.  NPS also maintains lumber-framed tent pads in front- and back-country campgrounds.  The lumber to be purchased herein will be used to replace aging bridge members and to build new tent pads. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Contractor shall provide lumber conforming to these specifications in the quantities listed below.   Due to fluctuating supply and delivery timing, NPS has structured the order for maximum flexibility.  Read and complete the Price Schedule section carefully.

Group 5: Pressure-treated wood poles, treated with ACQ to minimum 0.40 retention, 5-6" diameter at top end.  Prefer brown color. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE NPS will inspect the lumber package upon delivery.

The contractor shall replace the pieces at no cost or provide an equitable price adjustment (contractor will bear cost of returning items to shop). DELIVERY Delivery address is North Cascades NPS Complex, 7280 Ranger Station Road, Marblemount, WA  98267.  Notify Sarah J.

Wherever the words 'offer', 'proposal', 'offerors', or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they  shall be read to mean 'quote', 'quotation', 'quoter', 'vendor' or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Comme rcial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  'Procedures  for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Pr ogram (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Insp ection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Sat urdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor p ass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guar d as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5 inch es in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with  the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Char lie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fas t access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be  at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.   The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when  they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.'  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  'a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain ei ther a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contra ctor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate w hen the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.   The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor emp loyees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access ide ntification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria fo r being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason , the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required iden tification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the c ontractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an  employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a w ritten report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performin g work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether t he fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  ADDENDUM TO CLAUSES 52.111-4131, 52.111-4132, AND 52.111-4133:  Employees who require access to Fort Lewis to p erform work under this contract may obtain a Government sponsored identification badge.

This contract will be for one year with four on e-year option periods for a total term of five years.    The VaARNG will contract for a flat rate cost per copy program. This program provides for the contractor retaining ownership of the equipment at the end of the contract.

This fixed fee contract covers the use of the equipment, maintenance, parts, service and all consumable supplies, excluding paper.  The VaARNG envisions short-term delivery orders covering period s from 2 week to 6 months.  This contract may be utilized by the Virginia Army National Guard.  Fort Pickett and Fort A.P. Hill are anticipated to be the prominent locations where equipment will be utilized, but this contract will in no way be limited to t hese two sites.  Equipment may be ordered and used by any Federal Government agency when authorized by the contracting officer for any area of the State of Virginia.  Such agencies will pay invoices by government purchase/payment card.  The equipment provi ded to such agencies will be listed on the monthly reports however, the Virginia Army National Guard will not be responsible for payment. All equipment will be delivered, set up and made fully functional within seven calendar days of issuance of a delivery order.  A standard set up and delivery/pickup charge will be included in pricing.  The state will be divided into five regions; pricing f or each region is to be inclusive of all charges, including gas and mileage for delivery, service charges etc.  A map of these regions is attached.

The government will not purchase special paper for the fulfillment of this contract.  Contractor furnished supplies shall be delivered from 0700 to 1330, Monday through Friday (excluding Federal holidays).  Additional supplies will be made available to replace consumable supplies.  The contractor will deliver additional consumable supplies the same day as receiving the order.  The VaARNG shall not be responsible for any shipping charges associated with consumable supplies.

<p>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for the following commercial items:</p>

<p>0001- 	REMOVE AND REPLACE LEL MONITOR AND CONTROLLER
Furnish all labor, tools, parts, materials, facilities, and transportation necessary to remove, replace, install, and calibrate Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) monitor and controller. This system uses remote sensors to detect the presence of JP-8 explosive vapors in the building and automatically start a purge of the facility when predetermined LEL levels are reached. This system is located in the fuel cell maintenance facility, bldg 2414.The current system is a General Monitors model 610, Four-Channel combustible gas monitor. This system monitors the LEL levels of jet fuel, JP-8, and automatically activates an alarm and a purge fan when predetermined LEL levels are attained. The current system is old and unreliable as it no longer activates the purge fan. The replacement unit must be capable of operating in a range of 0-100% LEL and must be calibrated for our particular vapor, JP-8. It must also activate an alarm and automatically energize the control circuitry of the purge fan when the predetermined LEL level is attained. Recommend replacement with a General Monitors model MC 600 Six-Channel Combustible Gas Monitor (with four cards and 4 new sensor heads) or equal, as long as there are a minimum of 4 sensors.</p>

<p>A site visit is planned on April 6 at 0900, for vendors to look at the building, in order to give more accurate quotes regarding installation. The site visit will be at the location of the old system/where the new system is to be delivered/installed, bldg 2414. For this site visit, vendors are required to have a valid driver's license, proof of registration and proof of insurance. Vendors will meet at the visitor’s center at the main gate, have temporary passes issued to them, then will be accompanied by contracting personnel to the site where work is required.</p>
