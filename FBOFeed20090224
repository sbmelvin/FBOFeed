<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to define and investigate metrics for aircrafttrajectory flexibility and to develop methodologies for assessing and minimizingtrajectory constraints.Tasks1.	 The contractor shall extend analysis (of the impact of trajectory flexibilitypreservation on traffic complexity) to multiple complexity metrics. The contractor shallcontinue the assessment of the relationship between trajectory flexibility and trafficcomplexity using multiple existing complexity metrics from the open literature and anyother available sources. The analysis should include quantitative validation of theflexibility metrics as a predictor of risk exposure (i.e. the probability of theinability to accommodate future disturbances).	The analysis should include observationsregarding suitability of the existing complexity metrics for distributed trajectory-basedoperations and recommendations for the improvement or new development of complexitymetrics for better suitability.2.	The contractor shall extend analysis to the altitude degree of freedom andtherefore the flexibility metrics and preservation techniques, to the altitude degree offreedom.  Scenarios that include all of these degrees of freedom should be modeled andanalyzed, and any trade-offs between trajectory changes in altitude, heading, and speedin preserving flexibility should be identified and characterized.3.	The contractor shall analyze flexibility preservation performance in the conflictresolution horizon. Analysis will be conducted of flexibility preservation when used inconjunction with conflict resolution.  The analysis should assess how flexibilitypreservation in conflict resolution affects trajectory stability beyond the initialconflict.  Recommendations or observations should be made on integrating flexibilitypreservation cost functions with conflict resolution cost functions.4.	The contractor shall develop a trajectory constraint relaxation scheme. Thecontractor shall produce a methodology for relaxing or removing constraints to createtrajectory flexibility in overly or excessively constrained scenarios.	The methodologyshould be applicable to supporting the flight crew in negotiating constraint relaxationwith the service provider to maximize probability of meeting the remaining constraintswhile minimizing impact to service-provider and user objectives.  The contractor shouldinvestigate the methodology in scenarios involving traffic, weather, and required arrivaltimes.	5.	The contractor shall refine and update the metrics and estimation techniques asneeded to improve computational efficiency. The contractor shall investigate alternativesor improvements to the metrics and estimation techniques to make computationalperformance suitable for use in a real-time airborne trajectory planning system appliedin a dynamic trajectory environment.  The investigation should assess the trade betweencomputational efficiency and risk assessment performance as a function of estimationmethod fidelity.6.	The contractor shall develop and enhance software functions in NASAs distributedtrajectory planning system, the Autonomous Operations Planner (AOP) to provide trajectoryflexibility preservation functionality. The contractor shall develop and enhance softwarefunctions based on accomplishments in the tasks listed above.  The contractor shouldproduce in AOP the capabilities for planning long-term trajectories that preserveflexibility, incorporating flexibility preservation in the cost function of conflictresolution, and identifying constraint relaxation recommendations to the flight crew toimprove flexibility.  The contractor should also recommend a design for displaying to theflight crew the flexibility and constraint relaxation information.  The softwarefunctions should be sufficiently documented to facilitate AOP software integration.  Thecontractor should verify proper AOP-integrated functionality of the functions throughappropriate demonstration scenarios.Deliverables1.	Status briefing at the Langley Research Center.  Due on the last day of themonth, six months before final day of the contract.  The actual briefing date will bedetermined in consultation with NASA.  The briefing should summarize all majoraccomplishments and demonstrate current Matlab and AOP functionality.2.	Updated software for integration with AOP.   Due on the final day of thecontract.  The contractor should produce test software and interface documentation onemonth prior to the due date to allow testing of AOP software integration.3.	Final report that provides a thorough discussion and quantitative results of workaccomplished.  Due on the final day of the contract.  The contractor should produce adraft report 10 working days prior for review and comment.  The final report formatshould be appropriate for submission for publication as a NASA Contractor Report.  4.	Final briefings at the Langley and Ames Research Centers.  Due on the final dayof the contract.  The actual briefing dates will be determined in consultation with NASA. The briefings should summarize all major accomplishments.  The Langley briefing shoulddemonstrate final Matlab and AOP functionality.NASA/ARC intends to purchase the services from L-3 Services, Billerica, MA, 01821. Acurrent contract exists with this vendor and this posting serves as an official statementthat NASA intends to extend the contract for one year. Competition for these servicesdoes not exist because the extension of this contract aims to further research modelswhich were developed as a result of the current contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

 For Field Benefit Administration Services



This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This RFI may be canceled at any time, and may not result in the issuance of a solicitation or  award or contract.



Introduction 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) as a federal corporation to encourage the growth of defined benefit pension plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum.  Defined benefit pension plans promise to pay a specified monthly benefit at retirement, commonly based on salary and years on the job. PBGC, a wholly owned United States Government Corporation, administers the insurance program and termination process for most private-sector defined benefit pension plans that are tax-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.  PBGC is headed by a Director who reports to a Board of Directors consisting of the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Treasury, with the Secretary of Labor as Chairman.  General tax revenues do not fund PBGC.  PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers that sponsor insured pension plans, earns money from investments and receives from the assets (if any) of the pension plans it takes over.   

As reported in the 2008 Annual Report, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) protects the pensions of 44 million workers and retirees in over 30,000 private defined benefit pension plans.  PBGC administers two pension insurance programs, the single-employer program and the multiemployer program.  The single-employer program protects about 33.8 million participants in 28,000 pension plans.  Under this program, a company can voluntarily seek to terminate its plan using either a standard termination or a distress termination procedure.  Additionally, PBGC may seek termination of a plan without the employer’s consent to protect the interest of the plan participants of the plan or of PBGC.  In addition to the single-employer program, about 10.1 million people are covered by about 1,500 multiemployer plans.  PBGC must seek termination when a plan cannot pay current benefits. Ultimately, as a result of the termination of pension plans, PBGC pays benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  Information about PBGC’s goals and objectives can be found at:  http://www.pbgc.gov/

The Benefits Administration and Payment Department led by the Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for the administration of PBGC’s trusteed plans. The work of BAPD is carried out by eight (8) Trusteeship Processing Divisions (TPDs) and six (6) Support Divisions. In addition to the federal staff, the work of BAPD is also supported by a number of contractors. Successful performance for BAPD requires contractor and federal personnel to work as a collaborative team. 


Overview of Field Benefit Administration Services

PBGC established the Field Benefit Administrator (FBA) concept in the late 1980’s to handle the day-to day participant-related administration on its large plan terminations.  Today, the FBAs serve a vital role in performing almost 100% of the participant administration for PBGCs trusteed plans. In order to maximize its resources, BAPD looks to the FBAs handle activities such as record gathering, database building, calculating estimated and final benefits and placing participants into pay status. The work of the FBA typically begins when a plan is recommended for termination by the PBGC.  The FBA is responsible for the plan from trusteeship until a plan goes to Post Valuation Administration (formerly Ongoing Administration). In some instances, the FBA has also provided services during the PVA phase of processing.  Typically the case processing cycle last on average from 2.5-3.5 years. Once the plan has gone through the Plan Closing Process, the plan is transferred to one of the two primary ongoing administration contractors.

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

The FBAs  are currently responsible for the administration for approximately 600,000 participants in 400 trusteed plans. The Agency cannot accurately predict the number of terminations each year as this is a direct by product of the overall economy. The contracting vehicle sought under the proposed solicitation will allow for the required flexibility to manage the fluctuations in the inventory due to either increased or decreased plan terminations.  In addition, when a plan is trusteed by the PBGC the costs and effort associated with processing that plan from trusteeship through  to the plan closing process can vary significantly due to factors such as plan size, complexity, availability of data, etc. 

FBA offices currently provides the same range of services in support of BAPD’s mission, the size and structure of the FBA office varies due to different inventory levels of plans and participants the office manages. Under the current labor-hour contracts, the FBAs utilize a combination of the following labor categories to deliver services: Project Manager, Assistant Project Manager, Benefits Supervisor, Benefits Team Leader, Personnel Manager, Office Support Supervisor, Lan/Wan Administrator, Systems Technical Support, Senior Pension Administrator, Junior Pension Administrator, Entry Level Pension Administrator, Auditor, Administrative Assistant, Receptionist, and Image Scanner.  


DESIRED OUTCOME

BAPD’s desired outcome for the upcoming solicitation is provide responsive, timely and accurate services to PBGC’s plan participants responsibly.  BAPD must ensure that the FBAs contractor has the ability to ramp up quickly in the event of increased plan terminations and also contract when the work volume is no longer there. 

PBGC intends to submit six (6) separate solicitations covering existing FBA offices in the following geographical areas: Wilmington, Delaware; Pueblo, Colorado; Coraopolis, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Sarasota, Florida and Miami, Florida. Under the FBA structure, PBGC provides all the required equipment, facilities and systems for the FBAs to operate. 

The overarching purpose of this RFI is to determine if the attached requirements drafted by PBGC are presented in a clear and concise manner that would allow for a potential bidder to adequately bid on the proposed services.

Duke Energy Corp (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The electric system being privatized is described as follows The 181st Fighter Wing (FW) of the Indiana Air National Guard occupies 891.88 acres of leased land on the Terre Haute International Airport-Hulman Field, situated approximately five miles east of downtown Terre Haute, located in west central Indiana. The 181st FW occupies 4 administrative, 23 industrial, and 4 services buildings totaling approximately 323,335 square feet with approximately 275 full-time personnel. A unit training drill is conducted once a month and results in a surge of up to a total of approximately 1250 personnel. Power is provided by Duke Energy Corp. and enters the base at one location. It is delivered and distributed at 12.47 (kV) through a delta radial-branched configuration system. The primary distribution system consists of approximately 1,300 linear feet of 3-phase, 3-wire overhead, 27,100 linear feet of 3-phase, 3-wire, 15 kV underground circuits in conduit and 1,400 linear feet of 3-phase, 3-wire, 15 kV underground circuits in ductbanks.

Multiple branches feed five 3-phase dry type ventilated transformers ranging from 300 to 500 kVA, sixteen 3-phase oil filled transformers ranging from 150 to 750 kVA and seventeen 1-phase transformers ranging in size from 25 to 150 kVA. The system includes four 6 x 6 x 6 foot deep manholes, ten 4 x 4 x 3 foot deep manholes, one 10 x 20 x 12 foot deep concrete vault, 13 wood utility poles, 13 electric meters, 11 underground switches, 39 line fuses for underground switches, 12 overhead switches, and 24 line fuses for overhead switches. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system may not be adequate for present or future needs. Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour. All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Rubert & Co., Ltd., GBR-SK8-2PG Cheadle, for the purchase of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2461 Standard Casings.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Precision Engineering Division at NIST has developed Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2460 Standard Bullets and is developing SRM 2461 Standard Casings to support nationwide ballistics signature measurements for the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN).  NIST acquired the current SRM 2461 Standard Casings from Rubert, and completed the topography measurements which showed acceptable quality (CCFmax >95%).  In order to continue and complete NIST’s SRM 2461 standard casings project, NIST requires additional SRM 2461 standard casings.  Therefore, the additional casings must maintain compatibility with the existing casings.  Rubert & Co., Ltd., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 10, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Veeco Metrology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, for the purchase of a NanoScope V Upgrade which will be installed on an existing NanoScope IIIa of Veeco Multimode AFM Controller.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes a NanoScope IIIa of Veeco Multimode AFM Controller in the Surface and Microform Metrology of the Precision Engineering Division to image the small structures and smooth surface.  This purchase is for upgrading this existing NanoScope IIIa to NanoScope V controller made by Veeco.  The upgrade will extend the capability and performance of the controller which will enable NIST to probe softer surface and to better understand tip-surface interactions.  The Multimode AFM Controller is a system that requires 100 percent compatibility of all its subsystems to guarantee operation that meets its performance specifications.  Specifically, the unique details of the system are proprietary to Veeco Metrology.  Veeco Metrology, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required upgrade in order to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.  Veeco is the sole manufacturer and distributor.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 10, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Captioning and Media Transcription Services
Background
The National Park Service (NPS) satellite network plays a pivotal role in delivering mission critical training to National Park Service units across the country. Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is an interactive satellite based training network that allows participants to see and hear the presenter and for the presenter to hear participants through the use of push-to-talk microphones. A typical training scenario would be for the instructor to deliver a small chunk of content, usually 2 to 3 hours, from a television studio, which is sent to a satellite uplink and down to 238 downlinks across five time zones.  The network can reach 93 percent of Park Service employees.  In an average year about 100 hours of training are delivered in this manner.  About 95% of the captioning need is in delivering Realtime captioning for these type programs.  TEL - Technology Enhanced Learning - The NPS Distance Learning Center - headquartered at the Stephen T Mather Training Center, 51 Mather Place, PO Box 77, Harpers Ferry, WV  25425.  For more information on TEL, visit the TEL web site: www.nps.gov/training/tel
The Fish and Wildlife Services National Conservation Training Center located in Shepherdstown, WV, is the location of studio facilities and the satellite uplink used by the NPS.  Even though there are multiple studio locations the NPS uses, all programming goes throw this facility to the satellite uplink.  All Realtime captioning will be inserted using the Encoder at this location regardless of which studio is used.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a contract for non-recurring engineering (NRE) with ITT Avionics, Clifton, New Jersey, for development of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the ALQ-214 On-Board Jammer (OBJ) system currently deployed with the F/A-18E/F.  The ECP is intended to allow the existing ALQ-214 to meet the On-Board Jammer (OBJ) requirement for the F/A-18C/D as well as the F/A-18E/F.  The resultant ALQ-214 configuration will provide an improved OBJ capability for the F/A-18C/D when replacing the ALQ-126B, while maintaining all of the current ALQ-214 functionality when installed on the F/A-18E/F as part of the IDECM suite.  This effort shall build upon the on-going ALQ-214 ECP Risk Reduction efforts, which consists of the completion of system segment specifications, and conduct of a preliminary design review.  The scope of the NRE effort will include design, development, integration, and manufacture of sixteen (16) engineering development models (EDM) in support of Government laboratory and flight testing. 
 
This effort is being awarded on a sole source basis to ITT Avionics, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 because ITT is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AN/ALQ-214(V)3 subsystem and is the only firm that can provide these services within the required time frames and cost limitations.  This synopsis is being published for informational purposes only.  Expressions of interest in subcontracting shall be addressed to Ms. Kathleen Thornton, Contracts Manager, ITT Avionics at (973) 284-4014.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are: (1) extending the capability for rescue under pressure to 5 ATA through development of rapid methods of disabled submarine (DISSUB) atmosphere assessment, including calculations, to facilitate delivery of equipment and supplies by rescue vehicle to assure breathable atmosphere until able to accomplish rescue (12 - 24 hours); development of novel means to manage oxygen toxicity aboard the pressurized disabled submarine; development of novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to greater oxygen use and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration;  (2) assuring survival in a disabled submarine (DISSUB) for seven days by evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of present stores aboard new classes of operational submarines (SEAWOLF, VIRGINIA, and SSGN);  Guard Book guidance and procedures, including, but not limited to pre-escape command organization, lea! dership role of senior survivor, acceptance of scheduled order of crew evacuation; utility of medication to reduce the metabolic rate of the crew;  impact of starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation and nitrogen narcosis at 5ATA on decision making and ability to carry out Guard Book directed survival actions and escape; (3) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine by development and evaluation of heat stress curves for time and/or conditions to escape; heat mitigation measures (body cooling) in conditions of increased temperature and elevated CO2 (2.5 - 3%); (4) improving understanding and guidance for surface interval decompression sickness (DCS) risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including, but not limited to; mitigation with various periods of oxygen pre-breathing and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration;  (5) evaluating the adequacy of hypothermia protection with present available clothing in combination with!  SEIS suits in SEIS raft; (6) evaluating capability to escape from depths deeper than 600 feet by updating escape procedures and equipment; identifying necessary compression rates and further escape procedure and equipment changes that are needed; including new classes of operational submarines in the analysis;  (7) improving senior survivor decision tools;  (8) improving care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S. Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System, including, but not limited to critical care and casualty assessment. The areas of primary interest in diving safety and effectiveness are:  (1) development of new decompression models valid across the full spectrum of diving, including single and multilevel dives, repetitive dives, and surface-decompression dives, and which improve safety, reduce decompression time, track nitrogen and helium simultaneously;  (2) Improving understanding of short and long term oxygen toxicity associated with prolonged and repeated exposure to increased partial pressure of oxygen, including, but not limited to develop an improved probabilistic model to predict the risk of CNS oxygen toxicity; (3) Developing and/or refining noise protection exposure limits, monitoring and protection across the full spectrum of underwater sound, including underwater blast and impulse noise; (4) Developing improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures, aborts from a nitrogen-oxygen s! aturation dive accelerated nitrogen-oxygen saturation decompression; (5) Developing no-decompression curves for no-stop downward excursion dives on helium-oxygen from helium-oxygen saturation storage depths of 300 feet of seawater and less; (6) Assessment of the long term health of divers, including, but not limited to hearing, dysbaric osteonecrosis, neuropsychological disorders and neuropathies; (7) Improving diagnosis of decompression illness through, but not limited to utilization of algorithms; (8) Electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base;  (9) Improving the understanding of the nature of and relationship between patent foramen ovale and the risk of decompression sickness and the utility of neuroimaging studies in the evaluation of divers stricken with DCS or AGE;  (10) Investigating the etiology and refining the understanding and mitigation of hypercapnia (CO2 retention or intoxication) in divers during u! nderwater swimming through  direct measurement of arterial carbon dioxide tension and cognitive function in immersed exercising divers under pressure, including the effects of inhaled CO2 and increased breathing resistance, development of predictive equations relating end-tidal carbon dioxide tension to arterial tension as a means to estimate arterial carbon dioxide tension accurately and non-invasively, and respiratory muscle training; (11) Improving understanding of the mechanisms of isobaric counterdiffusion as it effects the skin, inner ear, and deep body tissues; (12) Improving understanding of the effect of increased oxygen partial pressure on nitrogen narcosis, including, but not limited to, developing an algorithm to compute "equivalent narcotic depth" on the basis of inspired oxygen and nitrogen partial pressures; (13) Improving understanding of and developing guidance for the prevention of immersion pulmonary edema;  (14) Evaluating compatibility of Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) prophylaxis medications and diving;  (15) Upda! ting nutrition and hydration guidance for divers, including, but not limited to preventing CNS Oxygen Toxicity with a Ketogenic Diet.The areas of primary interest in diving equipment are:  (1) improving equipment and procedures for contaminated water diving, including, but not limited to development of field-deployable screening tests for biologic and chemical contamination improving laboratory assays for contaminants in salt and brackish water, development of decontamination techniques, including rapid decontamination techniques, that will allow employment of surface decompression tables improving risk assessment and management techniques;  (2) Improving active and/or passive diver thermal protection (both warm and cold) for free swimming and tethered divers to extend effective dive duration and operational performance through improved insulating materials and suit design special protection for hands and feet; (3) Developing noise protection  and monitoring equipment for protection across the full spectrum of underwater sound, including underwater blast and impulse noise; (4) Developing real time CO2 mon! itoring for diver at mouthpiece/oral-nasal mask for use with closed or semi-closed rebreathers. (5) Developing an in-line (air supply hose) oil mist/particulates measurement for diver air from air compressors.(2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals For FY10, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 6 April 2009 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2009, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 22 June 2009.  For FY11, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 5 April 2010 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2010, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 21 June 2010.  Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available. The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Assistant, Lisa Williams at 850-230-3205 or E-mail: lisa.m.williams@navy.mil.  The pre-proposal should be three to five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal.  Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission. However, any such invitation does not obligate the Government to make an award.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required when animals are employed.  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor's committee for protection of human subjects.  This evaluation must conform with current Department of the Navy instructions relating to the use of human subjects, DODD 3126.2 and SECNAVINST 3900.39C.  Offeror! s must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged.  Proposals will not be returned after evaluation. (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror's capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the fol! lowing clause:  "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award."If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government's preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government. All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NEDU.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

The purchase order is being awarded under FAR Subpart 13.5 ? Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.
The U.S. EPA believes that Alfred Williams and Company is the only company that can provide repair and maintenance to ALL of the existing furniture in our facility because they are the only authorized dealer for all the furniture lines owned or leased at the EPA such as Kimball Office, Davis Furniture, Geiger, Herman Miller, Hickory Business Furniture and Krueger International.  The period of performance is expected to be from a base year of April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010 with 4 Option Periods.  
NAICS Code:  44210 Office Furniture Stores and the Small Business Size Standard is $7 million.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required support should explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any response(s) exist and therefore no Request for Quote (RFQ) is available.  
Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Interested vendors shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above and 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  
If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government an order will be placed with Alfred Williams and Company.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to conduct a competition after exclusion of sources for an Aircraft Occupant Ballistic Protection System (AOBPS).  The present phase of the competition is for a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) with an option for aircraft specific sample armor sets.  The successful offeror(s) from this limited competition, depending on the outcome of the SDD phase, may be invited to submit proposals for procurement of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities with an option for Full Rate Production (FRP).  This competition after exclusion of sources is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); that supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Per previous announcement on November 20, 2008 made available through the Government Point of Entry (GPE), this competition is limited to those firms who have demonstrated through a government live-fire test event held in January 2009 that the company can achieve minimum ballistic and areal density requirements as stated in the November 20, 2008, announcement. The Government anticipates the contractual efforts will generate classified information.  Therefore, successful offeror(s) must have a facility/storage clearance AND appear in the Defense Security System database as having such a facility clearance.  Participation of foreign sources as subcontractors is subject to approval, authorization or licensing procedures.  Sources: Armacel, 2255 Pleasant Valley Road, Suite, Camarillo, CA 93012; Armor Designs, Inc, 4645 South 35th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85040; ArmorWorks, 305 N. 54th Street, Chandler, AZ 85226; ATK Launch Systems, PO Box 707, Brigham City, UT 84302; Ceradyne, 3169 Redhill Avenue, Costa Mesa, CA 92626; Diaphorm Technologies, 7 Industrial Way, Unit #6B, Salem, NH 03079; LifePort Interiors, 1620 Heritage Street, Woodland, WA 98674; MDT Armor, 308 Alabama Street, Auburn, AL 36832; TenCate, 18410 Butterfield Blvd, Morgan Hill, CA 95037 and The Protective Group, 14040 NW 58th Court, Miami Lakes, FL 33014.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, to the Agency for consideration if received within 45 days of this announcement. The Solicitation is estimated to be released on 13 March 2009. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government’s acceptance of this information is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct an open, competitive procurement.  Solicitation will not be made available through the GPE. Solicitation may be requested from the Point of Contact listed in this announcement, when available.  No further announcements for this requirement will be made through the GPE.

<DESC><p>The 45 Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of environmental and ultra-trace analysis services. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with separation, manipulation, analysis, and identification of particulate matter for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate particles of interest for analysis; particle = singular microscopic item of interest requiring analysis for elemental, morphological, and isotopic information. Analysis requires the ability to: (a) process and analyze samples provided by the government; (b) process and analyze 6,000 particles per year from as many as 300 samples per year; (c) perform thermal ion mass spectrometry analysis of 6,600 particles per year; (d) perform nondestructive screening of up to 200 samples per year and characterize, using standard geometries, 30 samples per year by gamma spectroscopy; (e) identify isotopes of interest present in the sample using high resolution gamma spectroscopy; (f) perform secondary ion mass spectroscopy isotopic and elemental analysis on 50 samples per year; (g) maintain all processing areas and microscope clean rooms in accordance with the current General Services Administration standards for clean room and workstation requirements; (h) maintain class 100 clean room techniques sufficient to ensure no cross-contamination between samples; (i) describe and characterize sample particle isotopics, morphologies, elemental and molecular compositions using all available analytical techniques; (j) maintain the capability to perform isotopic and elemental analyses via scanning techniques such as microscope, electron microprobe, or ion beam; and (k) provide stoichiometry information on selected particles. Other requirements include: (a) in the event the Government elects to procure environmental and ultra-trace analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start; (b) offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique mission essential analysis equipment will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for environmental and ultra-trace analysis services shall not be used for activities other than AFTAC work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level. Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. No information related to this acquisition or resulting contract is releasable to foreign nationals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$12.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 15 calendar days from the date of publication. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above. The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received. The clause at Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation (AFFARS) 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this request. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, the first sentence of clause 5352.201-9101 paragraph (c) is tailored to read: If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force Space Command ombudsmen, [HQ AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil].</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONCYBER WARFARE SUPPORTThis is a Request for Information (RFI)only.  The Space and Naval WarfareSystems Center, Pacific (SSC PAC) isseeking comments on a draftStatement of Work (SOW) for CyberWarfare Support. The purpose of therequest is discussed in Section 2.0below.SSC PAC is contemplating a singleacquisition, with multiple awards, thatwill support all departments across SSCPAC in developing capabilities tosupport Cyber Warfare.1.0 BACKGROUNDIncreasingly, SSC PAC, Department ofDefense (DoD), and other governmentcustomers require advice, assistance,coordination and products to supportthe operational planning and executionand technology development requiredto assure superiority for the warfighterin the Cyberspace domain.Cyber Warfare is warfare in theCyberspace domain, which is definedby the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF)as "a global domain within theinformation environment consisting ofthe interdependent network ofinformation technology infrastructures,including the internet,telecommunications networks,computer systems and embeddedprocessors and controllers."Cyber Warfare would encompassComputer Network Operations (e.g.Attack, Defend and Exploit) andInformation Assurance and theCommand, Control, Communications,Intelligence, Surveillance andReconnaissance (C4ISR) andInformation Operations (IO) functionsthat operate in the Cyberspacedomain.

<DESC>Responses to this notice are not considered offers and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is for market research purposes only.  Respondents should not submit any proprietary information when responding to this notice.  Respondents should also note that the government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice.

The requirement for TESS is in response to the need for independent test and evaluation (IOT&E) of security technology equipment for the Office of Security Technology (OST) TSA.

The resultant contract will be the primary vehicle which OST will use to support performance of three key overall activities that must be accomplished to ensure successful IOT&E.   First is the ability to rapidly integrate, test, evaluate, model and simulate as required, and conduct recurring analyses and surveillance throughout the life-cycle of a variety of technologies, processes, and procedures in operational environments in a variety of locations and transportation venues (aviation and surface).  Second is the requirement to obtain and synthesize data, information, and reports from multiple sources and all phases of the acquisition cycle into one overall assessment of effectiveness and suitability of the system; and to assess and fully represent the level of risk associated with acquisition and use throughout the life-cycle.  Third is the requirement to independently assess the readiness of technologies and systems that may pertain to TSA’s mission.

The contractor may have to perform work at up to 30 sites simultaneously at CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Contractor products will be used by OST and other entities within TSA, and a wide range of stakeholders from the aviation and transportation community.  Areas of responsibility will accommodate the test and evaluation functions through all phases of the technology life-cycle, for technologies applicable to aviation, air cargo, and surface transportation.  To support the requirements of the contract, the contractor must be able to quickly respond to diverse evaluation needs of the aviation and surface community through a multi-disciplinary approach and have a variety of technical expertise that must be either immediately or quickly available – depending on urgency of assignments.

<DESC>ARMY COMBAT GLOVE APPROVED PRODUCTS LIST.   The Product Manager- Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE), under Program Executive Office Soldier (PEO Soldier) is offering manufacturers the opportunity to participate in the Army Combat Glove (ACG) Approved Products List (APL).  PM-CIE maintains an APL to assist Commanders and individual Soldiers in choosing flame resistant (FR) protective hand wear that is suitable and safe for their needs.  The APL will be used to inform Soldiers of items which meet U.S. Army requirements and may be purchased for mission use. By offering Soldiers a choice of FR hand wear in a variety of styles, PM-CIE believes Soldiers are more likely to wear hand protection when needed.  Improvements in protective hand wear are continuously sought as technologies advance and styles change. The APL will be coordinated with the Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) to facilitate the purchase of APL items through the AAFES Military Clothing Sales Stores (MCSS), as well as additional supply chain outlets. Approved gloves will remain on the APL for three years subject to the terms outlined in the policy.<BR><BR>Manufacturers with gloves on the currently approved APL must also be aware of changes to the existing policy.  Gloves currently on the list that do not meet the item description on the new APL Policy will be automatically removed.  <BR><BR>The APL Program includes an operational suitability assessment phase of testing.  Typical testing trials may include: fit and flex assessment, dexterity, keyboard operation, radio control operation, MOUT/Obstacle Course.<BR><BR>Soldiers will be asked to provide subjective feedback on the performance of the worn gloves.  Observations, task accuracy and times, questionnaire results and feedback from the test participants will be used to assess the performance and functionality of the ACG APL candidates in various missions and environments.  If the glove is acceptable to the Soldier and does not hinder mission accomplishment, the glove will be deemed acceptable for the APL.<BR><BR>The newly approved policy is available by emailing the POC below.  All submissions shall be provided by the vendor at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Darren Bean, PM-CIE, ATTN:  AMSRD-NSC-WP-WA, D225, Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5019.  This notice is for a market survey only.

Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ in coordination with the Office of the Product Manager, Close Combat Weapons Systems (PM-CCWS) and U.S. Army Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-AMRDEC), are currently seeking sources for technologies related to the capability required by Soldiers to defeat multiple targets with a disposable lightweight shoulder launched munition (SLM) capable of being fired from enclosures. The current inventory of SLM systems provides a capability against light armor and personnel within bunkers and behind masonry walls or within caves. However, these systems combined collectively do not provide the confined space firing capability to defeat personnel in bunkers, behind masonry walls, or within caves. We are seeking technologies to bridge this gap recognized in present systems as well as reduce the weight of the system to an objective of 12 pounds in order to provide the Soldier with a disposable confined space firing capability able to destroy fortified/hardened enemy positions, light armor and the ability to defeat the personnel within them. 
All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities qualification data in regard to the above no later than 30 days of this notice. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Please include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, and brochures/literature. Interested firms should adequately describe their experience in shoulder launched munitions technology. This is a market survey for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a solicitation and does not obligate the government to issue a solicitation..  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. 
All responding sources should submit their responses no later than xxxx December 2008 to JM&L LCMC Close Combat Systems Contracting Center, Attn: Mr. Thomas Dougherty, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000.

<p>The DynaTouch "TIPS Air Force OneStop" kiosk is an essential component critical to enable worldwide, self-service delivery of vital information to military personnel, civilian personnel and their families. DynaTouch is the only contractor that has developed a turnkey kiosk solution with a DoD-wide database of customer-focused, self-service information. DynaTouch developed and owns the software that manages the database, which consists of the master set of Department of Defense and Air Force display content for the OneStop kiosk. DynaTouch developed the database as a result of an extensive effort compiling data from individual contracts for single Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps installations, not by any DoD or Air Force-wide program or mandate; therefore, DynaTouch developed, owns and maintains the database. The database provides access to extensive kiosk display content that is appropriate for and readily available to utilize in support of the task completion. The database includes thousands of "kiosk-friendly" links to Air Force and DoD web-based content, on the following topics: military pay, civilian pay, travel pay, personnel matters (officer / enlisted / civilian / retirees), forms and applications, online services, FAQs, what's new, health and wellness, family support, housing and lodging, personal property/household goods, relocation assistance, local services, and much more. DynaTouch is the only company known that has developed an integrated approach to providing self-service information to military pay and personnel customers. Many enhancements and improvements have been incorporated into the DynaTouch kiosk systems over the last fifteen years as a result of the company gaining vast knowledge about the needs of their Department of Defense customers. It would be impossible to duplicate the Air Force OneStop kiosk solution without years of design, testing, programming and data collection effort. As a result of past hiring freezes and reductions in staff, the needs of AFAFO to maintain high and consistent levels of customer service are immediate. Successful completion of task requirements is predicated on utilization of the DynaTouch kiosk.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Benefits Officers Training and Development Group (BOTDG) is hosting a five-day Benefits training conference which will provide a series of workshops on Retirement, Insurance, Social Security, and Thrift Savings Plan Administration.  As part of the conference, there will be a vendor’s exhibit area.  The following information is for vendors who may wish to exhibit at the 2009 Federal Benefits Officers Training Conference to be held at the Hilton Miami Downtown in Miami, FL.

Subject: 2009 Benefits Training Exhibits

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Center for Retirement and Insurance Services, Benefits Officers Training and Development Group (BOTDG) will hold its 2009 Benefits Training Event in Miami FL on May 11 – 15, 2009 at the Hilton Miami Downtown located at 1601 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL, 33232. This year the Benefits Training Event will have a vendor exhibit area on May 13 and 14. The purpose of the training is to update the group on initiatives in the area, share information among agencies about actions some have taken to deal with benefits education, increased workloads, etc., and address crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, Social Security, workers compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. In addition, this year’s event will feature a 2-day workshop, Benefits Planning – The Road to Retirement Readiness (held on May 13 and 14), which will include the 3rd Annual Symposium on Retirement  Financial Education and Federal retirement and benefits related plenary and breakout sessions. This 2-day workshop will have general sessions of interest to all, providing an overview of our retirement financial education programs as well as news and updates on current Federal benefits programs.

In the past approximately a third of the attendees were Federal agency headquarters level staff with responsibility for administering the benefits programs within their agencies. The other attendees were field staff with benefits administration responsibilities at the field level. We anticipate approximately 450 agency representatives to attend this event.

Up to 15 exhibit spaces are available.  Exhibitors will rent the space directly from Powertrain, who is acting on OPM’s behalf to manage the exhibit booths and facilitate set up and dismantle with the on-site display company.  The rental application and payment will be submitted to Powertrain. Powertrain will accept payment by check, VISA or Mastercard. 

Participation in the exhibit area does not mean that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in any way endorses or approves the vendor or its products or services. Exhibitors may not represent in any way that their participation at the Benefits Training event represents any endorsements or approval by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. 

Exhibit spaces will be allocated on a first come first served basis. Registration must be received by April 10, 2009. The exhibit area will be in the Ballroom Foyer area of the Hotel.  Exhibitors may set up beginning at 8:30 am, May 13th. Exhibits must be removed by 4:00pm May 14th. Sessions in the Ballroom begin at 8:30 am each day and end at 4:30 pm. The attendees will have a number of opportunities to visit the exhibit area on May 13th and 14th.  The staffed exhibit booths will be 8’ by 10’ with pipe and drape and will include signage, an electrical outlet, one table and two chairs. The cost of a staffed exhibit booth is $ 1,150.00 for an 8’ by 10’ booth. Any other items needed for your booth; such as, VCR/DVD with monitor, phone line, internet access, etc., is available for an extra charge. You must notify Powertrain of any additional requests.  For additional information and an exhibit area registration form, please contact Brandon Mitchell of Powertrain, 301-731-0900 ext 110.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award sole source procurement to Murrison, Inc in Petersburg's, AK.  In accordance with FAR 6.303-1 and FAC 2005-30, this special notice announcement provides the Justification and Approval documents for Noncompetitive Contracts.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, requires lodging for the Office of Subsistence Management council members attending the Southeast Regional Subsistence Advisory Council Meeting on February 23-27, 2009.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy the agency's requirements.  Petersburg is a small village in Southeast Alaska.  There are two hotels.  The Murrison, Inc has been determined to be the only company that has the space to provide lodging for our staff and council members.  The CO contacted the other hotel, The Tides Inn and found they were not registered to do business with the government.  In addition, the CO conducted a thorough internet search for prospective places and found several B&B that would not be able to accommodate FWS needs (only available for 1 or 2 guests).  No other potential sources have been found.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 15 days after publication of this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

The vision for SEEC is a state of the art venue, located near or at GSFC, toconnect Goddards people, facilities and capabilities with students, educators andvisitors. SEEC is envisioned to be a non-traditional education center, providing thebeyond-the-historical perspective to show what is current at NASA and Goddard, andproviding dynamic programs, exhibits and interactive experiences to allow all toparticipate in Goddards unique work in action. If brought to fruition, SEEC wouldreplace the current visitors center.  Once in place, SEEC is planned to be a non-profitself-sustaining operation without the provision of appropriated funds.

<DESC>This is a synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quote number is N62645-09-T-0076.  Quotes are due not later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 04 MARCH, 2009. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 are incorporated.  NAICS 339112. Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to negotiate on a Brand Name Only basis to procure an Orthopedic Electric Drill System, manufactured by Stryker Instruments, 4100 E Millham, Kalamazoo, MI.  

In compliance with the Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) program and the Command’s initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Fleet Hospital applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Orthopedic Electric Surgical Drill System manufactured by Stryker.  The Bone Drill System made by Stryker Medical has been standardized for all of the fleet hospitals.  The installed base is currently in more than half of the fleet hospitals.  Brand name only is specified because the Government would incur a substantial duplication of cost, to consider other than the Stryker Instruments Orthopedic Electric Drill System, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the fleet hospitals.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet hospitals and reduce the lifesaving capability of each of the fleet hospitals.  

Any vendors who can provide the brand name only equipment are encouraged to submit a quote. The Government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract. This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items.

The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The lowest price technically acceptable offeror for this brand name only requirement will represent best value to the Government.  The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

BUSINESS QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS:  Offerors shall price each CLIN and shall submit firm-fixed pricing for all CLINS, otherwise your quote will be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration.  If no separate price for a CLIN this must be stated.  Brand name only. No substitutions will be allowed.  Shipping shall be FOB Destination.  Business quotes will be evaluated for Completeness (all CLINS are priced) and Reasonableness (the degree to which the proposed prices compare to prices that are reasonable, prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar equipment and commensurate with the Governments need). The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Include commercial price lists and if applicable, any FSS schedule numbers and pricing, and any applicable discounts to the Government.

Solicitation No. 2009-N-11155 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 29. This procurement has been set aside 100 percent for Small Businesses. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard are 541618 and $7 Million. The total period of performance under this contract shall be 7 months from date of award.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to continue its use of standard vocabulary in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) implementation specifications under development for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) data from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Phase III of the CDA for HAI reporting project will extend technical guidance for reporting HAIs, previously developed in Phases I and II of the project, to a new set of reporting requirements. These reporting requirements include vocabulary needed to convey HAI data in accordance with (1) NHSN specifications, (2) healthcare informatics and information technology standards, and (3) Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) requirements.</p>
<p>Phase III of the CDA for HAI reporting projectwill provide a standards-based solution that enables healthcare facilities that use commercial infection control surveillance applications to report HAI data to NHSN without having to perform duplicate entry of NHSN events and procedures. In States that mandate use of NHSN by healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction, development and implementation of an additional option for those facilities to participate in NHSN will strengthen CDC's collaborations with the States and the healthcare facilities in their jurisdictions. The time sensitivity of enabling use of this option for reporting HAI data to NHSN places a premium on identifying and retaining a healthcare vocabulary specialist who has prior technical familiarity with NHSN, healthcare vocabulary standards, and PHIN VADS requirements.</p>
<p>CDC goals are 1) to provide additional options for submitting data to NHSN, the CDA work products shall be maintained and updated as needed; and 2) to use healthcare industry standard vocabulary for collecting HAI data from disparate infection control surveillance systems. To achieve these goals, CDC seeks services of a qualified contractor to provide the following tasks and sub-tasks:<br /><br />TASK 1: Provide IG Maintenance and Vocabulary. (These items are being acquired on the basis of Time and Materials (T&amp;M).) <br />1.1 Maintain and update a single NHSN local code system (this task will be initiated by NHSN)<br />1.2 Addition of SSN# to patient data section<br />1.3 Additional rounds of balloting (if needed) after the initial round including attendance at WGM (1 person)<br />1.4 On-going modifications to the IG and supporting work products as a result of NHSN program changes.<br />1.5 MDRO modifications identified as result of web interface move into production.<br />1.6 Removal of OTH procedure code from vocabulary.<br />1.7 Concurrent changes to vocabulary tables in IG and NHSN, XML sample instance, Schematron, generate-narrative and display transforms.<br />1.8 Enhance and update online validator for batch processing through custom interface with NHSN host.</p>
<p>TASK 2: Provide data collection to add the following forms to the current Implementation Guide: BSI Summary form for SPC location; BSI Summary form for NICU location; MDRO and CDAD Prevention; and Outcome Measures Monthly Monitoring Form Lab ID Form. These items will be acquired on the basis of FFP (Firm-fixed price). The following subtasks are required:<br />2.1 Develop Implementation Guide additions including clinical statement design. <br />2.2 Produce complete sample instance document (XML)<br />2.3 Develop generate-narrative transform<br />2.4 Develop Schematron and test files<br />2.5 Modify display transform<br />2.6 Incorporate vocabulary into PHIN VADS<br />2.7 Attend HL7 WGM (travel expenses and hours for 1 person)<br />2.8 Modify IG to accommodate the addition of hosting NHSN vocabulary via PHIN VADS, adding references (URL or other)<br />2.9 Populate authoring tables for the inclusion of existing NHSN CDA vocabulary into PHIN VADS. <br />2.10 Update IG to reflect consolidation of local codes into single NHSN local code system (includes vocab tables, conformance statements, etc.<br />2.11 Migrate existing templates into data element database</p>

The National Park Service, Joshua Tree National Park, has identified a need to replace the 20 kW PV System Inverter at Cottonwood.  
Statement of Work
Background:The PV hybrid power system at Joshua Tree National Park consists of a 20kW (nominal) PV array, 20 kW three phase inverter, 35 kW propane-fueled generator and 2,500 Ah battery.
Requirement:Demo and replace the Cottonwood PV System Trace Hybrid 20 - 3 phase off grid inverter with a compatible single or multiple inverters in series. Retrofit or replace existing conduits and wiring to accommodate new inverter or inverters. The new inverter or inverters must be compatible with an existing Generac 35 kW 3 phase generator that is the back up power and also is used to charge and equalize the battery bank. 
Existing Equipment:1.  PV Array: The array is comprised of 266 frameless Siemens SP75 modules mounted to galvanized steel supports with industrial adhesive. The array field rating taken in July 1999 (normalized to Standard Test Conditions: 1000 W/m2 irradiance, 250 C module temperature) was 17,794 kW dc. The array is wired for nominal 238 Vdc operation.
2.  Battery Bank: The battery bank contains 132 C&D CPV2500 batteries for renewable Energy storage. Individual battery = 2 VDC, 2000 amp hour to 1.7 VPC @ 6 hour rate. The batteries are flooded, lead-acid cells, all in series. Nominal battery voltage and capacity are: 264 Vdc, 2496 Ah at the 100 hour rate. There are 11 plastic non-conductive trays, each containing 12 cells. Battery charging is temperature compensated utilizing an Type-T thermocouple affixed to the bus bar of the first battery (Tray 1).
3.  Generator: The generator is a propane fueled Generac model 98A 04635S 43.7 kVA/35 kW three phase unit.
4.  Inverter:  The inverter is a Trace Technologies HY-20-1, 20 Kw 3 phase, 60 Hz unit. The inverter acts as system controller conducting battery charging and equalizing, inverting, array peak power tracking, and generator start, as required. The 3 phase inverter ac output of 208 delta runs through a delta-wye transformer and is distributed throughout the site as 120/208 wye service.
Award will be made based on best value to the government.  The Government will award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Technical is equal to price.
Technical: 1) Demonstrated experience working on similar size and complex PV systems                 2) Experience working with government agencies                 3) Experience working in remote areas
QUOTES: Provide a proposal which gives clear evidence that you meet the requirements of the above three factors with acceptable performance levels.  Also provide complete information as to the type of inverter you propose to use.
Your price should be broken down as follows:
1) Inverters      Number of inverters_____________ Unit Price __________  Total  $  ____________________ 
2) Additional items, including controllers, wiring, overhead, profit, etc.  1 Lump Sum $ ____________________

<p>(d) The contractor agrees, that upon request by FERC, it will execute a FERC approved agreement with any party whose facilities or proprietary data it is given access to or is furnished, restricting use and disclosure of the data or the information obtained from the facilities. Upon request by FERC, such an agreement shall also be signed by contractor personnel.</p>
<p><br />Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an OCI, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. For purposes of this contract the term "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" means that a relationship or situation exists whereby an offeror or a contractor (including chief executives and directors, to the extent that they will or do become involved in the performance of the contract, and proposed consultants or subcontractors where they may be performing services similar to the services provided by the prime) has past, present, or currently planned financial or other interests that either directly or indirectly (through a client, contractual, financial, organizational or other relationship) may relate to the work to be performed under a FERC contract which (a) may diminish the contractor's capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice, or (b) may result in it being at an unfair competitive advantage. This prohibition does not preclude the normal flow of benefits from the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. After making a disclosure of an actual or potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall not proceed with performance under the contract until receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(c) Access to the use of information:</p>
<p>(1) If the contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as FERC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or data which has not been released or otherwise has not obtained prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, is shall not: (a) use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public; (b) compete for work for the FERC based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; (c) submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and (d) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the FERC.</p>
<p>(2) In addition, the contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions imposed on such information.</p>
<p>(3) The contractor shall have, subject to patent, data, and security clauses of this contract, the right to use technical data if first produces under this contract for its private use, provided that, as of the date of such use, all reporting requirements of this contract have been met.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies - The government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the government may apply any or all other remedies that may be permitted by law or this contract in order to redress its damages.</p>
<p>(e) The contractor further agrees to insert, in any subcontract or consultant agreement, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

 Manpower Data
 Center (DMDC - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.dmdc.osd.mil/)</span> is a highly referenced source for comprehensive repositories and associated
resources of personnel, manpower, training and financial data within the Department
of Defense (DoD). DMDC&rsquo;s data and programs encompass the military personnel
life cycle from accession to retirement, reserve components, families and
dependents of Service Members, and civilian employees of the DoD. To facilitate
the speed and accuracy of responding to data requests, DMDC maintains the data
in a variety of media: files, data delivery systems, and published reports.
DMDC also manages several operational programs using these databases. Automated

Such designation will not contain authority to sign contractual documents, order contract changes, modify BPA terms, or create any commitment or liability on the part of the Government different from that set forth in the BPA.

(b) The Contractor shall immediately contact the Contracting Officer if there is any question regarding the authority of an individual to act on behalf of the Contracting Officer under this BPA.   (End of clause)

Aircraft support will involve contractor aircraft only. The schedule of Air Support Services shall be provided to the contractor by an authorized Government representative as is required to satisfy USASOC and subordinate commands mission needs and in accordance with USASOC Policy. This requirement shall necessitate a commiserate degree of flexibility on the part of the contractor with regard to aircraft operations and workload scheduling, mission/flight preparations and the actual execution of the performance and performance quality of the services iterated throughout this PWS. Contract performance and performance quality shall strictly adhere to the Directives, Regulations, and Guidance iterated in paragraph 1.1 and elsewhere throughout the PWS. This data is accessible at the following website: https://asociweb.soc.mil/hqs-asoc/dcssoa/standard.htm and links thereon. <br />The unique mission/flight parameters and strict aviation safety requirements required for contract performance shall necessitate that the contractor provide fixed wing aircraft with side door or ramp capability. <br />1.2.1. MISSION/FLIGHT ITERATION SCHEDULING. The Government shall make every attempt to provide the contractor(s) with four (4) working days notice of scheduled mission/flight iteration to be performed under the contract. The Government reserves the right to make notice of an unscheduled mission/flight iteration with less notice (NLT 48 hours). On previous requirements, the Government has provided the contractor on average a 15-day notice of scheduled flight. 1.2.2. MISSION/FLIGHT ITERATION CANCELLATION/DELAY. In the event the Government schedules a mission/flight iteration and subsequently cancels the same, for example, in the advent of unforeseeable inclement weather condition changes, cancellation shall be effected by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government. One exception to the aforementioned policy shall be enforced. Government notification of a cancelled mission/flight iteration relayed to the contractor after the contractor's aircraft have taken-off from the contractor's principle base of aviation operations shall incur a late cancellation fee. This fee shall not exceed the cost of Air Support Operations for two (2) hours of service as prescribed in the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) on the Schedule of Supplies/Services of the contract. 1.3. CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL.

These qualifications shall be maintained for the term of the contract and shall be made available for inspection upon request of the Contracting Officer (KO) or the Contracting Officer's Representation (COR), or other authorized Government representative. 1.4. HOURS OF OPERATION. Actual performance mission/flight iterations with regard to Air Support Service often requires performance at night, on weekends and possibly Federal Holidays. The flight times will be coordinated with the Government Representative. 1.5. MISSION/FLIGHT OPERATIONS. Mission/flight iterations shall vary throughout the term of the contract. Typical mission/flight iterations are conducted in support of the Air Support Service operations, and administration thereto, of Military Free Fall HALO Jumps, Parachute Field Training Exercises, Bundle Drops, Proficiency Static-Line Airborne Parachute Operations and the like, at the various DROP ZONES (DZ) designated by the Government. Some mission/flight iterations may require simultaneous operation of as many as two (2) aircraft. An example of when two aircraft will be required is during training of infield complete teams or during Robin Sage infields when the exercise involves training 250 or more people using several different drop zones within a short period of time. The requirement of two aircraft may be required approximately 10 times per option period. The contractor shall be required to provide a second aircraft similar in make and model that meets all requirements and regulations specified in the PWS. The actual dates, times and mission/flight parameters for Air Support Service operations shall require close-on coordinated between the contractor's Project Manager and the COR, Jump Master, Drop Zone Safety Officer or other authorized Government representative designated by the contracting officer, as required. Under no circumstances shall the contractor perform work that is outside the scope of this contract. Under no circumstances shall the contractor exceed the number of flight hours or cost placed against an individual Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) regardless of the number of hours funding left on the total contract without written consent of the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall keep strict accounting of hours flown and costs expended on individual CLINs and notify the contracting officer as each CLIN reaches 75% of utilization of expenditures. Individual CLINS shall not be changed nor increased without prior written consent of the contracting officer. 1.5.1 SUPPORTED AREAS.

MISSION/FLIGHT PARAMETERS AND SPECIFIC TASKS. The following mission/flight operating tasks, or parameters, are typical of the Air Support Services the contractor shall be expected to perform under the contract. The contractor shall note this is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of Air Support Service operations. It also is not intended as an absolute definition of each mission/flight parameters relative to each iteration conducted. In fact, mission/flight parameters shall be tailored, by an authorized Government representative, for each iteration scheduled, to meet USASOC mission needs, and as such, may differ in detail from those that follow. 1.5.4.1 Air Support Services consist mostly of three general types of operations. 1) High Altitude Low Opening Parachute Technique (HALO), which will generally require the contractor to operate between a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above ground level and a maximum altitude of 12,500 feet above ground level for para-drop operations. Para-drops from this altitude are generally free-fall style of operations, with parachute deployment triggered by the jumper or an automatic opening device, but at times the PIO may require an aircraft rigged for static line HALO para-drops. 2) Static Line Parachute Technique (SL), which generally requires the contractor to operate between 800 feet above ground level and 1,500 feet above ground level for para-drop operations. Para-drop operations from this altitude will be static line drops and require the aircraft to be rigged for static line drop operations from either a side door or a rear ramp. Some cargo drops such as the Robin Sage Re-supply Bundle Drops require parachute rigged bundles/cargo to be dropped on a drop zone from an altitude of 500 feet above ground level. 3) Landing Zone Operations (LZ), which consist of aircraft landing and taking off from various small field landing strips for the purpose of discharging and picking up both passengers and cargo for transport to other mission locations and/or for return to the designated home airfield of the operation. Small field landing strips shall be both improved dirt and hardtop. This narrative does not represent all encompassing description of static constraint conditions in the operational environment and it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure a proper reconnaissance of actual operational conditions is conducted before each and every scheduled mission and that any flight safety issues based on the results are immediately made known to the COR and the Contracting Officer. . Air Support Service operations at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California, if scheduled may require all three types of Air Support Services. All mission profiles/parameters for providing Air Support Services at the NTC will be given to the contractor's program manager a minimum of five (5) days prior to required mission execution for planning and coordination with the using customer. 1.5.4.2 The side door or rear ramp of the aircraft used for Air Support Services shall allow ease of exit from the aircraft of a fully combat equipped paratrooper or dropped cargo as described in paragraph 1.6 of this PWS. Current Air Support Services for Fort Bragg missions are presently accomplished with a CASA 212 aircraft. All three types of Air Support Operations shall be conducted under both daylight and dark (daytime and nighttime) conditions. Unless otherwise instructed by authorized Government personnel as designated by the contracting officer, the pilot will turn on aircraft landing lights just prior to the beginning of initiating a drop and leave them on through the completion of para-drop operations across the drop zone, before shutting them off to assume a normal flight profile. All Landing Zones will be marked for landing by Government personnel and all landing zone operations will be conducted using aircraft landing lights. The contractor will ensure that all Air Service Support aircraft used has the capability to communicate with the Ground Party running the operation via approved VHF and/or UHF frequencies. <br />1.5.5.Air Operations Practical Exercises (AOPE). AOPE operations shall consist of HALO, Static Line, and Landing Zone Operations both day and night and include para-drops of both equipment bundles and personnel. For HALO operations dropping paratroopers, the aircraft shall be configured to allow a military free fall exit of the aircraft through either a side door or a ramp so as to support the ease of exit of combat equipped jumpers. For Static Line operations dropping paratroopers, the aircraft will be rigged with a static line as described in paragraph 6 of the PWS as to allow military static line airborne exit of the aircraft through either a side door or a rear ramp. For landing zone operations, the aircraft will be setup in-accordance-with mission requirements established in the pre-mission "close-on" coordination briefing with a designated Government representative from the using customer. The estimated time to complete this operation is seven hours. <br />1.5.5.1 Practice Airborne Infiltration Operations (PAIO). PAIO operations shall incorporate aircraft that have a minimum of 16 seats installed (approved side fold-up seats), rigged for Static Line para-operations, with an allowable cabin load capable for transporting fourteen (14) combat equipped jumpers per mission/flight iteration. PAIO missions can have as many as 150-200 total jumpers. The contractor can expect to carry on average between 10 and 15 lifts in a four to five hour period. For planning purposes, each of these missions will require the aircraft to fly a minimum of 30 minutes between the time instructor/jump master personnel can unfasten their seat belt and begin on-board jump preparations and the time the aircraft is in position for the first jumper to exit the aircraft. The aircraft must be able to complete a minimum of two complete lifts and jumps prior to requiring a refueling. The time between multiple drops at one site can be between 10 to 40 minutes. This operation is normally conducted during nighttime. Pilots flying this operation shall brief the flight routes to personnel that will be jumping. The estimated time to complete this operation is seven hours. 1.5.5.2. Robin Sage Airborne Infiltration Operations (RSAIO). Every effort will be made to utilize military aircraft for the RSAIO mission; however, in the event that military aircraft are not available, the contractor shall provide Air Support Services, to include, providing aircraft fully capable of supporting RSAIO requirements.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  
In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 172273 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-28. This is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 561790 Swimming pool cleaning and maintenance services and the size standard as set by the SBA is $7 million. The period of performance will begin at date of award. This Solicitation is compromised of: I. STATEMENT OF WORK II. FORMAT AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL III. EVALUATION FACTORS IV. CONTRACT CLAUSES V. SITE VISIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR OFFERORS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I. STATEMENT OF WORK The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is for the inspection and repair of the training tank liner, associated fixtures, and any other structural deficiencies in the training tank located in Laurel, Maryland 20708. General The training tank was built in approximately 1988 and is made as an aluminum structure not concrete. It was retrofitted at a later date (approximately 1993) with a pool liner attached to felt and the aluminum surface. The training tank is an Olympic size swimming pool but shorter in dimension by approximately one foot. The contractor shall inspect and repair any deficiencies in the liner of the training tank located in the Wilson Building. This work shall include all labor and materials associated with this project. The Wilson Building training tank is one of the essential training venues at the James J. Rowley Training Center concerning physical fitness and water safety. The training tank (pool) is a major component of the Secret Service physical fitness protocol and is used 365 days a year for training. Therefore, draining of the tank only occurs to rectify maintenance issues. The training tank currently has a leak from an unknown origin or source, causing the liner to pull away from the aluminum structure. This issue has allowed water to bubble between the pool liner and the felt that adheres to the aluminum structure. Due to the present issue, the training tank (pool) has been drained, thus no training can occur until this problem is resolved. It should be noted there is a crawl space around the entire perimeter of the training tank (pool). It is possible that corrosion could be found on the aluminum structure during the inspection. Although this repair is not covered under this contract, it should be brought to the attention of the COTR immediately. Statement of Work The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment, materials and labor for the inspection and repair of the training tank. The contractor shall conduct a complete physical inspection of the structure, crawl spaces, light fixtures, compression flanges/jets, skimmer, tank liner, and felt. The contractor shall remove the water which is currently trapped between the aluminum tank structure and the pool liner/felt. The contractor shall dry out the felt liner to prevent corrosion. Upon completion of inspection, the contractor shall perform the necessary repairs to bring the training tank back into full operation. The contractor shall install two main drain grates in compliance with the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act which shall meet or exceed industry standards in the training tank. Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR) shall approve all material selections prior to installation. Other consideration: All work to be performed by experienced trained personnel employed by a material manufacturer that has been engaged in the formulation and manufacture of reinforced PVC membranes for use in commercial pools for greater than 10 years. House Keeping Contractor shall remove all trash and debris, haul it to an appropriate dumpster, or designated trash site on a daily basis. All areas of work shall be broom swept and kept in an orderly state on a daily basis. Contractor Deliverables All deliveries are the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility. The contractor shall coordinate the deliveries with the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative prior to the delivery, specifying the date and time. The contractor shall be responsible for off and on loading equipment and materials. Upon contract award, the contractor shall submit a safety and health plan (accident prevention plan) for this project, specifically addressing their confined space plan. The inspection and maintenance operations in the crawl spaces around the pool shall be addressed from the standpoint of: atmosphere testing, communication, rescue operations, identification of the competent person, personal protective equipment (PPE), lighting, rescue equipment, etc. In addition, the contractor shall submit MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for all materials being used as part of this project. Special Provisions Contractor personnel proposed to work under this contract shall be US citizens and non-felons. They shall be subject to and successfully pass a police background investigation prior to being admitted to the James J. Rowley Training Center. Upon contract award, the contractor shall be provided with U S Secret Service contractor personnel access forms. Within five (5) days of contract award, the contractor shall submit these completed contractor personnel access forms to the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ II.

Q1. In order for me to be able to decide whether or not I should attend the Industry Day, it would be very helpful if you or someone could tell me if there is a possibility of replacing the current air dynamometer with a hydraulic dyno (water brake) as the solicitation isn't detailed on this point.

A1. The synopsis/solicitation contains a Statement of Objectives, with the intent of obtaining recommended best solutions from vendors.  The possibility of replacing the current air dynamometer with a hydraulic one depends on the proposed solutions received.

The purpose of this amendment 1 is to:
(1) Extend the deadline for receipt of proposals which was Wednesday, January 28 at noon EST to Tuesday, February 3 at noon EST; and
(2) Provide the following questions and answers.

Q: Does the current line fit into a bead lock around the top of the pool as I suspect? (Beaded Liner)

A: No.

Q: The felt on the face of the aluminum sides, what size pieces are these and how are they attached to the wall currently?
A: Unknown.

Q: How were the aluminum side walls installed and what is currently supporting them?
A: There is a support structure around the entire pool including the crawl space.

Q: Who is responsible for filling the pool after the liner is installed. (This must be done at the same time of the installation at a rapid rate because the liner is vacuum fit to mold exactly to the pool surface.)
A: Secret Service in coordination with a contractor will fill the pool.

Q: Are there any recessed steps?
A: Yes.

Q: How many lights are in the pool?
A: 15.

Q: How much area around the pool do we have to work?
A: 10 feet on the sides, 15 feet on the ends.

Q: Is there plenty of power supply surrounding the pool area for electrical equipment?

Q: What is the proposed start date for this project?
A: Immediately after award. Award is anticipated as no later than February 6.

Q: Do you have pictures of the pool in its current condition from the outside, a picture of the bead holding the liner, pictures of the back side of the aluminum from the crawl space?
A: A site visit has been offered. Secret Service will not publicly release pictures.

Q: What happens if there are excess cost because of issues not able to be identified until the old material has been removed or the preliminary inspection has been completed?
A: The contract will contain language such as:
After award of this firm fixed price contract, the contractor shall submit recommendations for any proposed changes that may fall outside of the original scope of the Statement of Work. The contractor shall submit these recommendations with their new proposal in contractor format to the Government which define the contractor’s need for change, scope of change, schedule impact, and associated costs to replace the pool liner due to technical obsolescence, etc. The contractor may implement changes to the SOW in future, bilateral modifications, which do not negatively affect the pool’s form, fit, function, or cause degradation to the system as defined by this SOW.

Q: Will we finalize the quote after the inspection prior to work beginning?
A: Your quote should fulfill the existing Statement of Work. If there is unanticipated additional work, or an unanticipated savings to the Government, the Contractor and the Government will re-negotiate the firm fixed price awarded

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 5 is to answer questions. The deadline for submission of proposals remains as 5 PM on Monday February 9.
<p>Question: Will the customer consider a sprayed on elastomeric monolithic lining as an acceptable alternative to repairing the failing liner? Pool liners fail; this alternative is significantly more robust and will not fail.<br />Answer: Secret Service will consider it provided the following information is given by the vendor: Pool they have applied it to that has an aluminum substrate, contact name and number at that pool, how long has it been installed, the length of the warranty for this material and how can the coating be repaired when damaged. Note that for any proposal received, all of the required elements stated must be discussed; see the entire solicitation.</p>
<p>Question: Also, on the recessed stairs could you tell me if the liner is on top of the stairs, i.e. each step has liner on them or if the stairs are composite or fiberglass that the liner only is attached around the outside edge? <br />Answer: The recessed steps are part of the Training Tank aluminum wall. They are totally covered with liner</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 6 is to post questions and answers. Proposals are still due at 5 PM on Monday, February 9.

Question: Has there been a structural evaluation of the pool's foundation and the building in the last 18 months?
Answer: No.

Question: Is there heavy equipment loaded into the tank for training purposes?
Answer: No

Question: Will this procurement include the cost of the full replacement of the felt and pool liner if necessary?
Answer: Another version of this question has already been answered. The vendor is to submit its proposal explaining how they will meet the Statement of Work. That proposal is for a firm fixed price contract; see below for further information.

Question: Will this procurement also include the repair of the tank's structure and or foundation if needed?
Answer: Another version of this question has already been answered. Please carefully and completely read this entire solicitation and its amendments. This requirement is for a firm fixed price contract. After award of this contract, if necessary, the contractor shall submit recommendations for any proposed changes that may fall out side of the original scope of the Statement of Work. The contractor shall submit their recommendations with their new proposal in a format to the Government which define the contractor's need for change, scope of change, schedule impact and associated cost to replace the pool liner due to technical obsolence, etc. The contractor may implement changes to the SOW in the future with permission, but these bilateral modifications must not negatively affect the pool's form, fit, function or cause degradation to the system as defined by this SOW.

Question: Is a bid bond required to be submitted with our proposal for the above referenced project?
Answer: No bid bond is required.

Question: What caused the problem?
Answer: A bubble or other problem developed in the tank liner which made us drain the training tank.

Question: Did the tank lose water?
Answer: There was water between the liner and the pool.

Question: What is the floor of the tank made of?
Answer: The entire training tank is made of aluminum.

Question: Is there a ripple behind the pool?
Answer: No, the bubble is visible within the tank; it appears that the liner has stretched within the pool.

Question: Why are we here for a site visit today?
Answer: The training tank liner has moved away from the wall. After we drained the tank, the liner moved back against the wall. There is still residual water against the floor.

Question: What type of proposal do you want?
Answer: The proposal is to answer the Statement of Work, provide solutions to our problem of having an unusable training tank. If something in the SOW does not make sense, then the vendor is to propose something that does. This is a best value procurement; Secret Service wants the training tank fixed and that fix to be warranted so that it will not occur again. We want the leak problem addressed in the problem, along with the vendor's solution, so this problem does not re-occur. We need a lasting solution

Question: Has the pool been patched before? What type of patching? By whom?
Answer: The pool has been patched before. We do not know the type of patching. Vendor information is confidential, as previously discussed.

Question: Is the facility under local jurisdiction?
Answer: This Secret Service facility is Federal.

Question: Has there been corrosion of the aluminum?
Answer: No.

Question: If we win the award, what are the work hours?
Answer: This is a 24-hour facility. Standard working hours are from 6 AM to 4:30 PM Monday through Friday. However, if the vendor proposes working different hours, extended hours or on weekends, as long as the vendor properly compensates their employees, all schedules will be considered.

Question: Does the Davis-Bacon Act apply?
Answer: No, this is not construction. The Service Contract Act will apply.

Question: How old is the liner?
Answer: Fifteen years.

Question: Does the pool auto-fill?
Answer: When operating, the pool is auto-fill.

Question: Is it theoretically possible that there is a leak on the other side of the pool, away from the part with the bubble?
Answer: Theoretically, it is possible but we do not think so.

Question: Could the pool be leaking into the ground? Or is there a concrete barrier?
Answer: There is no concrete barrier; the pool could be leaking or percolating into the ground.

Question: Did you perform a pressure test of the system?
Answer: Secret Service plugged the jets and opened one pump, and the tank held a steady pressure for 10 to 15 minutes. 

Question: Have any cracks been located?
Answer: No.

Question: Would you consider a deadline extension?
Answer: This RFP has been posted since January 22 and we are eager to have this awarded. We will consider any requests for an extension, please include any reason why, what the additional time will provide you, and how long of an extension you need.

Question: Did the water run out?
Answer: There is water still under the liner.

Question: Do you need the drains changed?
Answer: Please review the Statement of Work as that is covered.

Question: Has the pool been leaking underneath?
Answer: We believe it has not.

Question: Is the outside, the bottom, of the pool accessible?
Answer: No.

Question: How do I access the drains?
Answer: From within the training tank.

Question: How did the liner leak occur?
Answer: It was a slow growing leak. The liner appears to be 18 inches off the wall.

Question: Could this problem be a plumbing leak? Do the pipes leak?
Answer: Unknown. Secret Service is seeking pool experts to solve this problem with a five year warranty.

Question: How do I access the shallow end of the pool?
Answer: There is a crawl space.

Question: How long ago was the water drained out?
Answer: About a month ago.

Question: When was the pool patched?
Answer: About three years ago.

Question: When do you empty the pool?
Answer: Only when it is to be repaired.

Question: Was this liner welded in place?
Answer: Yes.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment/modification is to respond to contractors' questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Calendar Functionality/User Interface
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. RFI Statement: CPC shall be a web part versus a standalone software application with web interface<br />Question: The phrase "web part" might be a typo. We understand that you want a data base system behind a web site which will be accessed by COTS web browsers without the need to install software on client computers. Please correct our understanding if required.<br />Answer: CPC shall be a SharePoint Web Part.<br />2. RFI Statement: CPC shall be compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007, Internet Explorer 2007, SharePoint Server 2003 and Microsoft Share Point Server 2007<br />Question: Please define how you want the CPC to be compatible with MS/Office and SharePoint Server.<br />Answer: CPC shall be initially compatible with Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2003 and maintain compatibility after migration to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007.<br />3. RFI Statement: Events shall be displayed and color-coded as shown in attachment 1<br />Question: Is the color coding to correspond to event types listed in your item 4?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes<br />4. RFI Statement: CPC shall have a comment field with a maximum of 1000 characters<br />Question: We expect that there are numerous other fields that will be needed. For example a title, date, start time, end time, item control information (such as creator ID, creation date, time, edit history). Later you reference a priority field that is needed.<br />Later still you reference directorates implying that each event will or may have a directorate field. In 10 you reference the need for a hyperlink field. For each of these fields, we need to know your requirements more fully, for example, if there are more fields, how many of each field will be needed (for example, how many hyperlinks per record), if the fields are numeric or alpha, if you have preferences for color coding, or other limitations you need. Typically records should have a version number field so that system updates can respect old event record formats and handle them appropriately.<br />Answer: Our intention is to find out what is available COTS with minimal customization.<br />5. RFI Statements:<br />Users shall be able to access and modify the calendar simultaneously<br />CPC shall allow only certain users to have read-only access<br />CPC shall allow select users the ability to add, modify and delete data</p>
<p>Question: We expect that this would be addressed with a user name and password access control system. Is this your intention?<br />Answer: Our intention is to use SharePoint/Active Directory permissions.<br />6. RFI Statement: CPC shall be able to hyperlink documents to calendar entries</p>
<p>Question: Is it correct that the documents the hyperlinks point to will be stored outside of the CPC (for example, external web sites or documents stored on your systems in other locations)? Should the CPC do any verification of the entered links?<br />Answer: Yes, the documents will be stored in SharePoint Document Libraries or on Hard Drives. Link verification is not a requirement.<br />7. RFI Statement: CPC shall have a monthly and weekly calendar view<br />Question: It would be to your benefit to provide sketches of the different views (or screens) that you need. While we're capable of creating these ourselves you'll likely find additional critical requirements by taking a few hours to produce sample screen formats.<br />This should include the Briefing Displays you discuss later.<br />Answer: Again, our intention is to see what is available COTS.<br />8. RFI Statement: CPC shall ensure all events are archived in a database for future retrieval<br />Question: Do you have a particular archive database in mind, or are you saying that the entered calendar events will reside in the CPC's own data base? Do you want a management function to off-load records from the database in an archive format (for example a CSV file), and the comparable ability to load archived records back into the system for later use?<br />Answer: We envision a SQL database that resides on a back end SQL Server.<br />9. RFI Statement: CPC shall allow users to search the events database and create custom reports<br />Question: You should list the kinds of searches you'd like to be able to do. For example, do you want to search by one or multiple fields? Any particular fields or all defined fields? Do you want to construct Boolean searches (AND, OR, NOT type operators)?<br />Answer: This will be spelled out more in the PWS. Again, once we know what is available COTS, we'll be able to determine any needed customizations.<br />Briefing Displays</p>
<p>10. RFI Statement: CPC shall allow briefing calendars with font size large enough to be viewed from a distance of twelve feet<br />Question: On what display device should this requirement be supported? For example, an LCD projector at 1024x768 resolution projected on an 8' x 10' screen will appear much bigger than displaying a record on a 15" LCD monitor for viewing at twelve feet.<br />Answer: Briefings will be projected from a 1024x768 LCD Projector onto a 6' x 8' screen.<br />11. RFI Statement: CPC shall allow events to be displayed in priority order by color code<br />Question: Does this requirement mean that the color codes relate to the priority field?<br />Answer: Events shall be grouped and displayed by their color. For example, absences will be red in color and displayed before conferences which are blue in color.<br />Custom Reports</p>
<p>12. RFI Statement: CPC shall have the ability to customize reports so that the x-axis be labeled with the days of the month and the Y axis be labeled with different directorates (minimum35)<br />Question: You use the plural term "reports" here and in this section. Do you have a list of reports that you require?<br />Answer: We require one custom report at delivery plus the ability to create additional ad hoc reports as needed.<br />13. RFI Statement: CPC shall have the ability to customize reports so that the x-axis be labeled with the days of the month and the Y axis be labeled with different directorates (minimum35)<br />Question: Is this the only customization you require? Or are your customization requirements more general?<br />Answer: This is the one custom report we require at delivery. Other customization will be based on what is or is not available COTS to meet our stated requirements.<br />General</p>
<p>14. RFI Statement: N/A<br />Question: Finally, is a particular commercial, off the shelf product that you are attempting to procure here or are you looking for the development of a custom system?<br />Answer: At this time, we are investigating possible COTS solutions which meet our requirements or will meet the requirements with minimal customization.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>---NOTICE--Closing date changed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 6, 2009, 3:00 pm</span> local time.&nbsp; </strong><strong>An amendment furnishing additional details is to follow shortly.&nbsp;------------</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for a five (5) year, Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Occupational Healthcare and Medical Services at NIOSH Morgantown, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, West Virginia.</p>
<p>
<p>Physicals at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are provided to the Health Hazard Evaluation Field Team members, Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Officers, Safety Office personnel and Facilities Maintenance personnel. All other employees have the opportunity to participate in the medical monitoring program. Those employees who elect to participate in the program are given physicals based on their age. NIOSH has a requirement for an estimated 135 Physical Examinations (i.e., physicals) per year and additional add hoc testing, add hoc vaccinations, and supplemental occupational health services.</p>
<p>NIOSH has employees that are part of the CDC Emergency Response Team as well as the PHS Commissioned Corps Readiness Team. These teams are involved in incident management activities to include the prevention of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major emergencies. Depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, additional NIOSH employees not currently on the team may be called to respond to an emergency. This would require immediate medical services which would include a responder readiness (general fit for duty) medical clearance and may also include immunizations and/or respiratory medical clearance. It is essential that the contractor administering the medical surveillance program for the NIOSH-Morgantown facility be located nearby to the facility (within approximately 20 miles) or be able to provide services in that vicinity within eight (8) hours of request for services.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award, firm fixed priced contract with a period of performance of five years.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about February 05, 2009 and proposals will be due on or about 3:00 p.m. February 20, 2009. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOps internet site.</p>

The NIH Clinical Center serves as the nation’s premier research hospital for conducting clinical research to improve the health of humankind.  The Clinical Center also serves as the national resource for clinical research by fostering dynamic interactions with outside partners; developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient, and ethical conduct of clinical research; training clinical researchers; and leaving the clinical research response to the nation’s emerging public health needs.

The Clinical Center Complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the hospital of the NIH consisting of 242 inpatient beds, 90 day hospital stations, outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center) that covers 661,600 sq. ft. and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (Hatfield Center) that covers 870,000 sq. ft.  The Magnuson Center is fifty years old and had a substantial addition completed in 1981 which is called the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  The ACRF is a fourteen-floor structure which houses clinics and research laboratories on twelve floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and PET, surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.   

The Hatfield Center opened in 2005 and houses the inpatient units, day hospitals, additional clinics, admissions, pharmacy, social work, rehabilitation medicine departments, staff use areas, support areas and research laboratories.  The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium at the core of the building that connects four separate sectors that house occupants.  Patients are housed on levels 1, 3, 5 and 7 on the southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest sectors of the facility.  Levels 2, 4, and 6 are interstitial mechanical space except for small clusters of offices on the east and west elevator lobbies and atrium portions of the facility.  Research laboratories are located on levels B3, B2, 1, 3 and 5.  The laboratories lead to the southeast and southwest patient care units through distally placed elevator lobbies.

The purpose is to provide consistent and reliable Patient Care Unit Clerk (PCUC) staffing for various patient care units and patient care support areas within the NIH Clinical Center.   Twenty-eight (28) positions have been designated to be filled by contract staff on an ongoing basis.

Patients that are seen at the NIH Clinical Center may be anxious, fearful, sick, have physical deformities, etc.   In addition, many of the patients and families are not from the local area and this sometimes creates additional anxiety.   It is extremely important that the contract personnel maintain a consistent high level of customer service and convey understanding, responsiveness, care and compassion. 

The duties listed below are a general list of the requirements for this contract.  The patient care unit clerk will only be performing the duties for the specific area assigned. Not all duties below apply to all areas.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by HUD in one geographic area, the state of Arkansas.

The primary objective is to perform closings on HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.

The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closings within the allotted timeframes unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractor’s control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with three one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation is now available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.

Washington, DC

The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (PBS), DC Service Center, 301 7th Street, SW, Suite 2670, Washington, DC, 20407.

This is a re-advertisement of a previously issued advertisement under the same project number 6DC0172.  Changes to the proposed firm term of the lease have been incorporated into this advertisement. 

The UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT is seeking expressions of interest to lease approximately 303,480 rentable square feet of office and related space in the CEA of Washington, DC.

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a property located in Washington, DC, under a lease that is soon to expire.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 303,480 rentable square feet of office and related space, including 17 secured onsite parking spaces.  The delineated area for this requirement is the CEA of Washington, DC.

The lease term requirement is ten (10) years with cancellation rights after the eighth (8th) lease year.  The building must be within 2,640 walkable linear feet (1/2 mile) of a metro rail and amenities.  

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing leased space or to relocate.  The government is interested in considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements.  

The building must be located outside of any 100-year floodplain.  Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current Federal, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, and OSHA.

The Government is using a tenant broker to represent them in lease negotiations for this transaction.  In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.

Please send expressions of interest for evaluation purposes to the Government’s Broker:

Email:  bill.craig@am.jll.com

1. Building name and address.
2. Building ownership information.
3. Space available, it’s location within the building and its condition (shell or built-out).
4. Date of space availability.
5. Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
6. Amount of parking available on-site and its cost – indicate whether the rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking. 
7. List of building services and amenities provided, if any.

The Government’s decision regarding whether or not to solicit offers will be based, in part, on complete information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that your response to this ad fails to provide the required information the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government’s requirements.

<CONTACT>Paul Vicinanzo, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-712-5147, Fax 202-216-3051, Email PVicinanzo@usaid.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: 

The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a solicitation (Request for Proposals) for warehouse and logistics services under an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The purpose of this RFP is to obtain warehouse services for USAID Title II Food Aid Pre-position program commodities.  Such commodities will consist of packaged agricultural products to be used to respond to humanitarian emergencies worldwide, with an emphasis on the Horn of Africa.  This RFP will seek proposals for warehouse services at one or more locations within each of the five regions specified below.  Contractor will be required to provide warehouse space at the offered warehouse locations upon request by USAID.  However, contractor need not maintain open warehouse space when not required by the USAID food aid program.  Contractor will be required to have warehouse space available in any/all proposed warehouse locations at the request of USAID with 30-day notice.  It is anticipated that two locations will be maintained throughout the duration of the contract, although USAID may require greater or fewer warehouse locations be opened as program requirements dictate.  USAID anticipates one warehouse location in the United States Gulf Coast region; and one near the Horn of Africa with preference for Djibouti.  Other proposed warehouse locations should be based on historical data of Food for Peace responses to emergency food aid requirements, which will be included in the RFP.  Warehouses will be maintained on behalf of USAID for a required period of time.  At the end of the required time period, USAID will request that the warehouse(s) services cease at that location.

Regions:
Horn of Africa: Supporting areas from Algeria to Somalia
Central and Southern Africa: Supporting areas from Kenya to South Africa
South East Asia: Supporting areas from Afghanistan to Japan
West Africa: Supporting areas from Northern Mauritania to Angola
United States Gulf Area: Supporting areas from Central America to the Caribbean

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The USAID authorized geographic code for this activity is 935.

The RFP is expected to be published o/a March 6, 2009, and will be distributed through this website. Any amendments to this pre-solicitation will also be issued and posted only on this website.  Questions or concerns should be directed to Mr. Paul Vicinanzo at (202) 712-5147 or pvicinanzo@usaid.gov .

Issuance of this notice does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay for any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of comments, suggestions, or a proposal.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to defer issuance of a RFP solicitation or not to issue a RFP if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>Description: 
This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisitions and Procurement Office (WHS/A&PO), on behalf of the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA).  Note that this is not a request for quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   This RFI seeks industry comments to assist the Government in (1) Locating potential sources with the ability to satisfy its requirement (2) provide contract number and point of contact for current or past contract for a similar product.  The critical element of this RFI is product availability.  Small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business under NAICS code (541720) with a size standard of $7.1 are encouraged to respond. 

Background: The Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) provides the stewardship of technology security policy and programs for the Department of Defense (DOD).  DTSA’s technology security mission is to develop and implement policies on international transfers of defense-related goods, services, and technologies to ensue such transfers are consistent with U.S national security interests.  Technology security policy development and implementation requires DTSA analysts to conduct extensive research and evaluation of data from numerous and diverse sources. This electronic database is required in support of open-source research for export license applications and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cases.


Requirement.
DTSA reps require access to a database capable of identifying proliferation, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and arms controls activities. The database should be able to provide accurate information, provide a history of cumulative open source data on nuclear, biological, and missile-related sites that identify entities and projects involved in nefarious and prohibited activities.


Provided below are specific requirements for an electronic database that DTSA is searching for in order to meet it’s mission:

1.  Electronic ability to research current continually updated background on entities involved in weapons of mass destruction and proliferation activities from multiple countries including China, Iran and North Korea.  
2. Single source search capability for background information on foreign countries and entities. 
3. Ability to search on several different data fields. 
4. Ability to search on phone numbers.  
5. The software/database must allow for link analysis; must bring together all known associates and subsidiaries, along with their company profiles and/or core business descriptions. 
6. Provide a search capability to pinpoint and define all Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) categories applicable to the Technology Directorate.
7. DTSA requires 5-10 user accounts with concurrent online access.
8. Ability to print and save data from the database in useable format.
9. Rights to use information, for no additional charge for any use the Government deems necessary.

Responses should not exceed 5 pages and should specifically include (a) identification of the product proposed (b) Description of ability to meet the requirements listed above, (c) description literature that will allow the Government a range of vision for the database. 

RFI Guidelines: 
Please note that this synopsis is for INFORMATION and PLANNING purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI. The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to enhance the success of any future procurement to meet this requirement.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which WHS releases and disseminates the information for review. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.

<DESC>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA - SFO 07-014 -OFFICE SPACE NEEDED - U.S. GOVERNMENT will seek to satisfy NEW AND / OR SUCCEEDING LEASE REQUIREMENTS through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program during the month of OCTOBER - OFFER SUBMISSION PERIOD OPEN OCTOBER 1, 2008 THROUGH OCTOBER 7, 2008.  You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD), and 07-016 (VA)) in order to be considered for lease award.  REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the "Register to offer space" link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.
