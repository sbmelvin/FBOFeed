<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to Toray Membrane America a requirement to pilot test their Toray TML 2540 and TMG 2540 spiral wound polyamide thin film composite membranes.  The government investigated and obtained specifications for all commercially available spiral wound brackish water cellulose acetate and polyamide membranes; as the government's facility is only capable of utilizing spiral wound membranes due to the configuration and equipment installed in the facility.  The facility is treating brackish ground water and therefore requires membranes that are manufactured for this purpose.  There are two types chemistry used in the fabrication of brackish water reverse osmosis membranes: cellulose acetate and polyamide; both chemistries are being evaluated in the pilot test. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government believes that only one source can provide the products that will satisfy the agency's requirements.  A Justification supporting a request to enter into an acquisition which precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Every manufacturer of commercially available membranes that could potentially fulfill the requirements for this application was contacted by the government.  Selection for pilot testing criteria was as follows: (1) capability to produce large quantities of non-standard size membranes; (2) membranes ability to produce water that meets the product water requirements; and (3) ability of satisfy the following government facility's criteria. Criteria for Selecting Membranes for Pilot Testing Criteria Description	                                                Numerical Criteria 1. Similar water fluxes in stages 1 and 2.	Ratio of fluxes in stages 1 and 2 within the range of 0.75 to1.33. 2. Acceptable water flux through                           Water flux of stage 2 tail element is greater than 3.5 gfd.     stage 2 tail element.	 3. Acceptable RO product salinity.	                RO product TDS is less than 500 mg/L. 4. RO product salinity of stage 2 tail                       RO product TDS of stage 2 tail element is less than 2000 mg/L      element is somewhat less than the      RO TDS (2300 to 2700 mg/L) 5. Acceptable feed pressure	                                Less than 400 psi. Firms believing they can provide a similar required product must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements including the above criteria. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Cangene Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only responsible source and 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
A contract was awarded, to Cangene Corporation, in January 2003, as a result of a competitive procurement for the production of botulinum antitoxin.  To date the contractor has developed Assays and conducted the necessary Pilot Runs (4).  As a direct result of the Sept. 1, 2001 tragedy and the increase in threat of bioterrorist activities against the United States (U.S.), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventon (CDC) has a need to contract for additional botulinum antitoxin in addition to the botulinum antitoxin that will be produced under the contract described above.  The DHHS and CDC has a need to contract with an experienced firm that possesses the capability and capacity for the production, licensure, and delivery of up to 200,000 doses of Despeciated Heptavalent Botulinum Immune Globulin (BIG) for use as a Heptavalent investigational product under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and to develop a strategy to license the product that is produced.  The contractor will also be responsible for monitoring the potency of the BIG product for an extended period of time.
At the time of award, the prospective contractor must possess the necessary capability and capacity required for cGMP production and licensure and all FDA validation production requirements. The FDA has now determined that both sets of plasma (the January 2003 Cangene contract and the resulting contract for an additional 200,000 doses as described above) can go under one license.

<CONTACT>Rachael  Raposa, 978-318-8249
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing a invitation for Bid for theTown Pond Restoration, Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Town Pond is located in Portsmouth, Rhode Island adjacent to Mount Hope Bay.  The modern historical condition of the Town Pond are a was tidally influenced open water prior to a Corps navigation improvement project placing dredged material in the area in the early 1950s.  At that time, tidal exchange to the interior marsh was effectively halted. The Town Pond Restoration Project calls  for a combination of fifty-percent salt marsh-fifty percent open water/intertidal habitats with on-site disposal of excavated material.  This was selected as the best overall plan for habitat restoration, aesthetic acceptability and affordability.  An est imated 126,000 cubic yards of existing dredged material would be excavated to promote restored tidal exchange to Town Pond.  Over time, the interior marsh will be transformed from a lower value brackish habitat to a high value salt pond and salt marsh habi tat.  The excavation and regrading of the area to reach the new profile will require the establishment of an effective plan for control and diversion of water.  There will be some vegetation removal in the staging and access areas (approximately 1 to 2 acr es of upland vegetation and asphalt at the southeastern end of the site off Anthony Road) on the Roger Williams College property.  The size of disturbance of the staging area, access roads and temporary haul roads will be limited to the minimum necessary f or construction access and a line of erosion control devices will be established along the perimeter.  Temporary haul roads will be removed following their use and these and other areas will be allowed to revegetate following construction.  Areas with seve re slopes or disturbed soils with a high potential to affect water quality will be replanted to limit erosion.  A small area of salt marsh (approximately 80 square feet) will be destroyed to deepen and realign the entrance channel inlet.  Salt marsh plants  will be removed by others prior to construction and planted along the new channel alignment to reestablish a salt marsh cordgrass fringe resulting in no net change in wetland area. Approximately 18 acres of phragmites, which is above the elevation of tida l influence, will be removed to restore salt marsh and estuarine habitat.  Once elevations are established that are flooded by frequent tides estuarine habitats and vegetation communities will establish. There are two concrete structures that will be built  as part of the project.   A 45-foot long, 42-inch diameter culvert with concrete headwalls will replace a smaller old culvert that will be removed and a concrete weir approximately 38 feet long will be built to regulate a permanent pool where the entrance  channel meets the interior marsh.  The plan requires some phragmites wetland filling to construct a water control berm along the west side of the site to prevent flooding of FounderÃ¢Â€Â™s Brook by salt water.  The water control berm would fill approximat ely 3.2 acres of wetland and the public access area would fill approximately 0.35 acre of wetland.  The berm would be seeded with coastal grass and shrubs would be planted at occasional intervals along the top.  Some excavated material would be used to con struct a 6,750 square foot parking area with an entrance off of Anthony Road.  Restoration plan has on-site disposal of excavated material in phragmites wetlands.  The plan would require 7 acres of wetland fill.  The disposal area will be seeded with coast al grasses (e.g. switchgrass) after construction is complete to create a coastal grass community. During the construction phase, there will be provisions to allow continued maintenance access to the existing electric transmission lines that run through the  project area.  THIS SOLICITATION IS UNRESTRICTED.  Solicitation shall be made available via the Internet on or about 8/13/03.  No paper copies of the solicitat ion or amendments will be available. The firms interested must register on the Internet to receive the solicitation.

<DESC>In 2001, the Secretary of Energy designated the Office of Worker Advocacy (OWA) in the Office of Environment, Safety and Health to establish and administer Subtitle D of the Energy Employeeâ€™s Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP) Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-398).  The Act directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to assist current and former DOE contractor employees covered by the Act with a qualifying occupationally related illness in filing state workersâ€™ compensation claims.  The Act also directed DOE to establish expert Physician Panels to review claims and to determine whether the applicantâ€™s illness arose out of and in the course of employment by a DOE contractor and through exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility.  The Physician Panelâ€™s operations were established in the DOE rule â€œGuidelines for Physician Panel Determinations on Worker Requests for Assistance in Filing for State Workersâ€™ Compensation Benefitsâ€ (10 CFR Part 852, August 14, 2002), as amended. In December 2001, OWA and the Department of the Navyâ€™s Space and Naval Warfare Information Technology Center (SITC) SITC entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  The purpose of the MOA was to establish an agreement between the agencies to obtain support to the DOE EEOICP from SITC.  In accordance with the authorities provided for in the Economy Act, DOE issued an Interagency Agreement (IA) to SITC in support of the MOA.  In support of its obligations under the IA, SITC made available its existing support contractor, SEA. In April 2004, DOE initiated action to compete and award its own contract for the services being provided by SITC and its support contractor SEA.  In July 2004, DOE issued a competitive solicitation (Request for Quotation (RFQ) DE-RQ01-04EH04007) to acquire program management and operational support for EEOICP case processing, physician panel operations and support, and records management.  The competition is being conducted under the GSAâ€™s Multiple Awards Schedules program.  The target date for selection and award of a contractor is on or before September 30, 2004.  The DOE is currently in the process of evaluating proposals it received under the RFQ. In the event that the new contract is not awarded prior to September 30, 2004, or if a short transition period is required beyond September 30, 2004, DOE intends to award a sole-source bridge contract to SEA, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This bridge contract will continue the support to the EEOICP that is currently being provided by SEA under IA Number DE-AI01-02EH02006 with SITC.  It is anticipated that the bridge contract will include a three-month base period and three (3) three-month option periods, and would be effective October 1, 2004.  Under the bridge contract, the contractor will continue to provide OWA with case processing services in support of their administration of Subtitle D of the EEOICP Act.   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTATION OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   Any inquiries regarding this procurement may be posted to DOEâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS).   Any proposal(s) to accomplish the work required under the bridge contract must be submitted via IIPS by September 24, 2004.

<DESC>R-Implementing Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis of L2C Deployment- 
U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Irving Leveson using simplified acquisition procedures for consulting services to conduct the study: GPS Modernization: A Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis of L2C Deployment and Reflecting L5 deployment.  NOAA has a requirement, as identified in Program Guidance memoranda, to immediately implement this program. The effort will be carried out under the Office of the Chief Economist. The effort will incorporate scenarios for deployment of satellites and signals and for strength and speed of demand for GPS, L2C and applications as a function of technical characteristics and capabilities of L1, L2, L2C, L5, developments in technology; substitution effects against dual frequency coded L1 C/A & L2C use vs. L1/L2 codeless/semi-codeless use and for L2C use vs. L1 C/A single frequency use, market segment characteristics, and market penetration paths; assessment of competition and reinforcement between RNSS systems as a function of technical compatibility and market strategy, and between RNSS and ground-based systems,; benefit valuation and cost measurement, scenario-based analysis of  risks and benefit trade-offs among civilian and military uses with alternative L2C deployments, controlling for deployment of GPS IIRMs and M-Code UE; roles of GPS in a GNSS; and strategic quantitative and qualitative analysis of policy alternatives as a function of scenarios and risks. 

The contractor will be responsible for developing the substance of the analysis and preparing reports and presentations.

<DESC>Subject:  Federal Business Opportunity Announcement

The United States Marine Corps intends to award a sole source, ninety day, bridge contract in support of the “Water Survival and Egress” training program to American Systems Corporation of Chantilly, VA.  The effort is currently being performed by American Systems Corporation.  The estimated value of the bridge contract is $1,500,000.00.  The bridge contract will provide sufficient time for the Marine Corps to award a competitive contract for like support.  The period of performance for the bridge contract will commence 01 October 2004.

Program Description:

The United States Marine Corps currently has a “Water Survival and Egress” training program in place at the Marine Corps Base Japan (Okinawa), Marine Corps Base Hawaii (Kaenohe Bay), Camp Pendleton, CA and Camp Lejeune, NC.  The focus of the training curricula is to train passengers aboard water-borne craft (including helicopters, light armored vehicles, amphibious vehicles and the MV-22 aircraft) to successfully egress a ditched craft, employ the use of emergency air and deploy flotation devices necessary to rescue.  There are Modular Amphibious Egress Trainers in operation in all sites, except Camp Lejeune, which will be operational in FY06.  

Requirement:

The prospective contractor will provide the necessary staff and management for the four sites listed in order to deliver instruction or the full “16-hour” curriculum leading to certification for egressing the trainer.  This training is in operation at C. Pendleton, Hawaii and Okinawa for up to 3,000 students at each site per academic year (48 weeks) or up to 6,000 at Camp Lejeune (8-hour curricula) during FY-05 (Emergency Breathing Device and Shallow Water Egressing, only).  The perspective contractor will provide 72-hour maintenance response in Hawaii and Okinawa for the MAET and 48-hour response in Camp Pendleton and Camp Lejeune (when brought on line in FY06).  The prospective contractor shall perform an “Annual” maintenance on the MAET and its associated equipment (gantry and hoist) in the three primary sites and at all four sites (including Camp Lejeune) from FY06 and thereafter.

The training staff will have sufficient “certified” staff necessary to operate both the egress portion and SWET and emergency bottle familiarization courses simultaneously.  Certification shall include qualification as either a hospital corpsman or state/nationally certified emergency medical technician.  A typical staff shall include a Supervisor/ Instructor, a Primary Instructor, a Device Operator, an IP/HABD (emergency breathing device) Instructor and a Medical Provider.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to enter a sole-source procurement from Laser Techniques Company 14508 NE 20th St., Bellevue, WA 98007 for acquiring a laser gun bore mapping system.  This equipment will be used to support the Vacuum Arc Vapor Deposition (VAVD) project.  The VAVD program is an OSD-sponsored effort to investigate the suitability of a specialized plating technique for restoring worn-out mortar tubes to serviceable condition.  In order to accurately measure the p! lating added to the mortar tubes, the interior surface of the tubes must be measured and mapped in great detail both before and after the plating process.  Data gathered by the methods currently available, such as bore scope photography and mechanical star gauges do not provide the fidelity and resolution of the interior bore surface required for this program.

<DESC>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of one firm-fixed price construction contract. The 100% Plans and Specifications Request For Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement. This project is to provide Repairs to Electrical Distribution for Naval Station, Ingleside, TX.  The work involves removal of existing overhead static/neutral conductor from the south overhead circuit, and provide new static/neutral conductor; removal of existing phase and static/neutral conductors from the existing north overhead circuit and provide new phase and static/neutral conductors; removal of existing battery house in switchyard and provide new battery house; removal of existing capacitor bank and provide a new capacitor bank; removal of existing enclosure from pad mounted switch and provide a new stainless steel enclosure; removal of existing corroded pad mounted transformers and provide new pad mounted transformers; removal of existing 15 kv switchgear on wharf and provide new pad mounted switches; provide new foundation and pads for existing pad mounted transformers that are listing; removal of existing feeder to building 303 and provide a new feeder and modify interior wiring; and incidental site work.   The station will remain in operation during the work and outages shall be held to a minimum. The station will remain in operation during construction, which will require extensive coordination with station personnel.  The Contractor will be required to complete work quickly, often during nights and weekends, shifting construction work location from one area to another to accommodate station operations.  The Contractor will be required to leave major systems in operation at the end of every workday. The work also includes reconnection to existing electrical utilities, testing, and incidental related work. 
This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. The Government will award to the offeror whose technical proposal and total evaluated price provides the best value to the Government using a tradeoff process, price and technical factors considered.  Price and technical are of equal weight.  This solicitation will result in a firm-fixed price contract with an estimated construction cost between $1,600,000 and $2,000,000.  Close construction coordination and management by the construction contractor of all work will be essential in order to fulfill the work restrictions and schedule requirements for this project.   Proposers will be evaluated on Technical Factors as follows: Factor A--Past Performance; Factor B—Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Factor C—Technical Qualifications; and Factor D – Technical Approach.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; to award to the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal or the lowest priced proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, offerors are requested to propose their most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of the proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise their proposal.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for services to improvements in 3-D, Unsteady Turbine and Pump Flow Prediction Capabilities. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Trustees of Boston University as a sole source procurement to implement year 2 and year 3 (option) from the basic contract awarded to Sondak Consulting via purchase order number H-36375D.  Year 2 -  Two Equation Turbulence Model The Contractor shall implement a two-equation turbulence model into Phantom to complement the existing algebraic turbulence model.  The Contractor shall validate the model with an accepted suite of benchmark cases agreed upon with MSFC.  The implementation of the model and the results of the benchmark cases shall be documented in quarterly and final reports. Application of Phantom to Secondary Flow Paths The Contractor shall develop and implement flow field initialization routines for secondary flow paths and cavities. The Contractor shall apply Phantom to two secondary flow paths and cavities representative of those found in rocket engine turbines and pumps.	MSFC shall provide the Contractor with the geometries and boundary conditions.  The Contractor shall post-process the results, and provide them to MSFC in an agreed upon format in quarterly and final reports.	 Framework for Cavitation and Two-Phase Flow Models The Contractor shall develop the framework needed to support cavitation and two-phased flow models.  The Contractor shall implement this framework into Phantom.  The details of this framework and its implementation shall be reported in quarterly and final reports.   Year 2 Simulations The Contractor shall run the following verification cases with the improved code.  Geometries and flow conditions will be provided by MSFC in an agreed upon format.  1) 3D flows in turbine and pump secondary flow paths; 2) 3D flows in a turbine and pump cavities; 3) 3D flow simulations for turbulence model validation.  The Contractor shall document the results in an agreed upon format in the quarterly and final reports. Year 3 Implementation for a Cavitation Model A cavitation model is currently being developed by CRAFT-Tech, Inc., as part of a Phase II SBIR.  The Contractor shall implement this cavitation model into Phantom.  The Contractor shall validate the model with an accepted suite of benchmark cases agreed upon with MSFC.  The implementation of the model and the results of the benchmark cases shall be documented in quarterly and final reports. Year 2 Simulations The Contractor shall run the following verification cases with the improved code.  Geometries and flow conditions will be provided by MSFC in an agreed upon format: Two 3D geometries for validation of the cavitation.  The Contractor shall document the results in an agreed upon format in the quarterly and final reports. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) Dr. Douglas Sondak who currently is employeed by the Trustees of Boston University and is the co-author of the CFD code CORSAIR, which is to be restructured in this project.  Because of Dr. Sondak's familiarity and experience with CORSAIR, he is deemed the only contractor suitable for performing the services required.  CORSAIR is the only code of its type that meets MSFC requirements for rocket turbine unsteady predictions, and is the code that MSFC currently uses and maintains. 2) Dr. Sondak implemented the General Equation Set, which we want in 3D code CORSAIR under this project, into the 2D CFD code WILDCAT under contract to MSFC.  A switch in contractors would adversely impact the continuity of the effor and raise serious questions as to the compatibility between required enhancements and the currently available code. 3) Dr. Sondak currently works through Boston University rather than through Sondak Consulting. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Allison K. Sandt, Eagle Systems & Services via fax or email, 256-544-6062 or allison.k.sandt@msfc.nasa.gov not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on September 25, 2004.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Jami Rodgers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4781
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) intends to award a Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The  RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-24. The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial  Items and FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition. The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible small business whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to  the Government, cost and other factors considered. BACKGROUND. EPA's RPD Innovation Team is dedicated to investigating emerging trends, both scientific and cultural, and technologies that may potentially  impact the field of radiation protection. RPD has investigated  radiation-related challenges  to governance and new approaches to provide solutions to those challenges. Included among these was radioactive sources that have fallen out of regulatory control and the application of industrial ecology approaches as a tool to enhance the management of these materials in the environment and  commerce; and exploration of emerging genomic tools and their potential to provide a better understanding the long term implications of low level radiation on human health. These projects included seminars open to a broad range of participants from public as well as private sectors, joint efforts  with academic and non profit institutions and the application of industrial ecology principles, and visits to organizations outside the DC area to interview leading experts in the topics being explored. The results have provided insights and ideas into approaches to better understand and manage  long term radiation challenges facing the government and public sectors, particularly through dialogues occurring during the seminars.  Additionally, implementation of industrial ecology approaches to the management of lost radioactive sources has begun. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Purchase Order  is to provide written analysis (10-20 pages)  of efforts to date and long term direction for all efforts conducted by RPD on industrial ecology and genomics, and the further investigation of the potential implications these tools may have on the future of radiation  protection through two  speaker/forum events. Additionally, two other areas of emerging trends in the field of radiation, as well as other environmental mediums, and emerging technologies that may directly or indirectly impact radiation and the protection of human health and the environment shall be investigated through  speaker forum events to be identified. The speaker/forum events shall be approximately two hours in duration, open to both the public and private sectors, and are to be held in Washington, DC. Therefore, the ideal candidate for this requirement will be within 30 minutes commute from Washington, DC.  Information on previous industrial ecology and genomics will be provided by EPA. TASK 1: Identification of Speakers and Target Audience and Logistics. The Contractor shall provide technical assistance to EPA in identifying four seminar/forum events.  EPA will submit ideas of topics and speakers, as  well as potential audiences to the Contractor.  The Contractor may provide input and ideas for potential seminar events to EPA, for the final approval by EPA COR. There are no specific dates for seminar events, with the exception of the final seminar, which shall occur no later than September 15,  2005.  All relevant information pertaining to each seminar event will be verified between EPA Simplified Acquisition Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Contractor one month prior to each date. TASK 2A: Arrangement of Speakers and Dates. Speaking dates and relevant information  pertaining to speakers background and topics should be arranged and verified between EPA and contractor one month prior to actual date.  This will include verification of room where seminar is to be held. TASK 2B: Production and Distribution of Invitations. The Contractor shall produce invitations  to the seminar, describing the topic and speakers' background.  The Contractor shall submit the invitations to EPA two weeks prior to actual seminar date.  EPA is responsible for determining the list of invitees and distribution of invitations of each seminar. TASK 3:  Summary Reports of Industrial  Ecology and Genomics Projects. The Contractor shall produce summary reports detailing the industrial ecology and genomic projects conducted by RPD. These reports shall include the following: (a) History of project, including the focus defined and why it was initially considered; (b) time line line  of activities and corresponding mile stones related to each and the evolution to the current status, including lessons learned from each phase, if applicable; and (c) future directions of projects.  Information on previous industrial ecology and genomics efforts will be provided by EPA. TASK 3A:   Submission of Draft. The Contractor submit two draft reports to the EPA COR  by August 1, 2005.  EPA will review the reports and submit any comments or changes to the Contractor no later than September 1, 2005. TASK 3B: Submission of Final Report. The Contractor shall submit a final report to the  EPA COR by September 25, 2005. EVALUATION FACTORS. The Government intends to make award to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the Request for Quote (RFQ) and is most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.

DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:
(Mrs.) Sang Rubo, Vice General Manager, Zhejiang Beilun Power Generation Company, Ltd, Ningobo City, Zhejiang Province, People’s Republic of China, Phone: 86-574-8689-2174, Fax: 86-574-8688-9396.  
The Zhejiang Energy Group Company invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an Environmental Emissions Control project to assess the technical and economic aspects of NOx reduction at the Beilun Power Plant, and to prepare a set of technical specifications to be used in soliciting bids from international suppliers for appropriate modifications to the five coal-fired boilers at the power plant.  The Study shall determine the most cost effective technology for bringing the plant into compliance with Chinese statutes governing NOx emissions, and evaluate technical options that might be effective in achieving further emissions reductions, which could be applied to other plants in the Zhejiang Energy Group Company (ZEGC) system.  It should also identify ways to improve the project's chances for implementation, and emphasize the advantages that proven U.S. technologies could provide for the project.

Zhejiang Energy Group Company requested a grant from USTDA to assist in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions at its Beilun Power Plant. The Zhejiang Provincial Beilun Power Plant, a subsidiary of ZEGC, is the largest coal-fired power plant currently operating in China. It is located in the coastal city of Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. Ningbo has one of the most rapidly developing economies in the southern part of the Yangtze Delta, and the plant is a key part of the regions infrastructure. The Beilun Power Plant (BPP) consists of five-600MW generation units that have been purchased on the international market. Their ages range from four to twelve years.  Due to the high nitrogen content of coal fuel, and the high thermal intensity in the boiler furnaces, the BPP’s NOX emissions are relatively high.

Recently enacted environmental laws governing emissions from existing power plants will result in heavy fines for the plant’s owners, and possibly restrict the building of new power plants in the region, unless substantial reductions can be made in the plant’s NOX emissions. ZEGC has decided to make modifications to the plant to reduce the emissions, but has found that advanced technology needed to accomplish this goal is not available within China. ZEGC would prefer to make use of US technology because all of the boilers at Beilun are based on design practices developed in the US, and US equipment suppliers are actively pursuing NOX reduction business in China.

NOX emissions from power plants have been linked to respiratory illnesses, photo-chemical smog, and “acid rain”, which results in crop losses, diminished water quality and damage to buildings (particularly older buildings, which may have significant historical relevance). The elimination of 30 to 50% of the NOX emissions from one of China’s largest power plants is a major benefit for the Ningbo region. In addition to the immediate benefits in the Ningbo region, the successful demonstration of effective NOX reduction at Beilun will lead to similar projects at other coal-fired power stations elsewhere in China. Given that China is on its way to becoming the world’s foremost producer of electricity from coal, the broader implications of a successful demonstration at Beilun are momentous.

U.S. exports for the Beilun project could run between $9 –10 million. There is also a good possibility that similar NOX reduction technology will be needed for ZECG’s other power stations, which amount to 4210 MW of additional capacity.  The cost of bringing all of those units into compliance with the new NOX emissions regulations could easily run between 1 ½ and 2 times what will be needed for Beilun, or around $30 million.  

ZEGC is strongly committed to going ahead with a cost-effective scheme for reducing its NOX emissions. They stand to loose about $5 million a year in fines if they can’t bring the plant into compliance with national guidelines in the next few years. They are also concerned that they may be constrained from building additional power plants in their service territory if the levels of NOX in the ambient air increase much beyond current levels. This could be a serious deterrent to their growth as a power company. 

In addition to being motivated to move forward with the project, they are in sound financial condition. They expect to be able cover nearly 60% of the cost of the project from operating returns received over the three-year period that will be needed to complete the project. Considering ZEGC’s good record of financial management, and the relatively low debt to equity financing plan for the project, it is unlikely that they will have trouble coming up with the needed funds.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $304,830 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., October 30, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM, is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors for the development of conceptual designs, and a systems and component technology assessment for those conceptual designs, for a wide-field of view, multi-access space-based laser communications capability.  This effort will be in support of the MAWFEA (Multi-Access Wide Field of View Enhancement Activity) program at the Space Vehicles Directorate.  The overarching goal of this activity is to develop an all-electronic, MEMS, Holographic Optical Element, or hybrid multi-access laser communication beam steering system with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 by 2008.  

This activity is being divided into a conceptual design development and technology assessment phase, and a second phase for technology and system development to a TRL of 6 and delivery of a full-scale brassboard by 2008.  This BAA is a call for proposals for the first phase of this activity, the goal of which is to develop conceptual designs and evaluate the technical feasibility and risk of these conceptual designs.  This purpose of this first phase is to define the path for a second phase of this activity which will consist of technology and system development efforts.  Teaming between component technology developers and systems developers is encouraged.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this activity.

As a minimum, phase one proposals shall outline a clear path to enable future wide-field of view multi-access laser communications, greatly enhancing the performance of planned future space-based laser communication systems and enable these future space systems to meet performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, affordability and availability goals, while significantly reducing risk are of particular interest.  The proposal(s) submitted in reference to this BAA shall be for the first phase of this effort.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM will host a Briefing for Industry on March 4, 2004 where more detailed information and requirements will be presented.  Parts of this meeting will be held at a SECRET/NOFORN level.

<DESC>1.  Introduction:    Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES).  The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense’s Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and Warfighting domains, as well as interfaces with the national Intelligence Community (IC) domain.  
 
As the enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely.  This new environment must (1) support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible; (2) alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission; (3) provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commander’s information management policy; (4) ensure information assurance (IA)/security; and (5) support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for the exchange between the Core Enterprise Services (CESs) and the Community of Interest (CoI) capabilities.  Transport is not an inherent component of NCES; however, the CESs are dependent upon adequate bandwidth and availability of the GIG infrastructure to support the domains and CoIs.  

The specifications listed below are used to support this architecture:
		
SOAP	Version 1.1
WSDL	 Version 1.1
UDDI	Version 2.0
WS-Interoperability	Basic Profile 1.0a
XACML Version 1.1
SAML	 Version 1.1
XML-DSIG   W3C Recommendation 2002-02-12
XKMS	 Not yet supported
WS-Security	1.0 – SOAP Message Security
1.0	– X.509 Token Profile 
Draft  04 – SAML Token Profile

2. Security Core Enterprise Services (CESs)
The Security CESs, consist of a number of functional service groups, each of which may include one or more service interfaces that perform specific tasks.  

2.1 Policy Services

This service group provides policy-based authorization and access control for Web Services and system resources. 

2.1.1	Policy Decision Service 
2.1.2	Policy Retrieval Service 
2.1.3	Policy Administration Service
2.1.4	Policy Subscription Service 

2.2 Credential Management Services

This group of services provides access to the underlying DoD PKI infrastructure.  The group is envisioned to offer a subset of XKMS functionality, starting with the X-KISS spec and potentially moving into X-KRSS as well. 

2.2.1	Certificate Validation Service 
2.2.2	Certificate Registration Service
2.2.3	Certificate Retrieval Service

2.3 Attribute Services

In order to support policy-based decisions, various attributes are needed. This includes those of the principals, the system resources, and the application environment.  This service group provides standard access mechanisms for such attributes, and defines how attribute queries are returned as SAML attribute assertions.  The request-response mechanism is also based on the standard SAML Protocol. 

2.3.1	Principal Attribute Service  

2.4 Trust Domain Federation Services

The Trust Domain Federation Services is responsible for managing a trust domain’s trust relationships with other domains.  Its interfaces may include registering and deregistering other domains as trusted parties, and inquiring about established trust relationships. 

2.5 Security Context Services

These services provide mechanisms for sharing security contexts across multiple Web Services.  Such contexts are necessary in a dynamic SOA environment where indirect or brokered trust relationships abound.  For example, when service A invokes service B on an end-user’s behalf, a common security context can help establish a boundary for this unit of work so that, for instance, service A cannot forward the request to an unintended service C even if A possesses a valid user assertion.

In an enterprise service environment, security contexts are important in addressing service orchestrations and workflows.  They may also help improve efficiency especially in interactive scenarios. For example, results of certain authentication and authorization steps may be performed only once for a series of consumer-provider interactions within a common security context. 

Currently there are standards proposals under development such as WS-Trust, WS-SecureConversation, and WS-Coordination that address this topic.  Future service specifications will consider conformance to them once they become approved.

2.6 Auditing and Logging Services

Enterprise auditing is also an important requirement for the security architecture. Two pieces of functionality need to be provided:  recording the service level activities (logging), and identifying anomalies (such as access violations or attacks) from those records.  The logs include:

--Outbound message information (message ID, sending timestamp, host, target service, etc.)
--Inbound message information (message ID, receiving timestamp, etc.)
--Message signature verification (success / faults)
--Certificate validation and status checking results (success / faults)
--Policy decision results (permit / deny / indeterminate)
--Invocation status (resource, action, success / faults)
--Remote logging and auditing

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Wastewater Collection and Treatment, Potable Water, and Service Water Systems at Picatinny Arsenal, Morris County, New Jersey.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Picatinny Arsenal is located in New Jersey’s Morris County, approximately 40 miles west of New York City.  The installation has over 1,000 buildings, and covers nearly 6,500 acres. The Installation Management Agency is the proponent for all Installation infrastructure and support operations at Picatinny. Tenant organizations include the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Program Executive Office for Ammunition, Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Support, and the Program Executive Office for Soldier.

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
The WWTP has an estimated design capacity of 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD), is permitted to treat 0.50 MGD, and presently treats an average flow of 0.29 MGD. Lift Station No. 80A is located at the WWTP and lifts all sanitary waste into the plant for treatment. Wastewater receives primary treatment in two Imhoff tanks followed by secondary treatment using a fixed-film process where fixed nozzles distribute wastewater over rock media. Wastewater is then clarified in a 28-foot diameter secondary clarifier. Primary sludge and fixed-film humus (secondary clarifier sludge) is stored in the digestion compartment of the Imhoff tanks until it is stabilized. Stabilized sludge is then transported by service contract to a federally approved and permitted disposal site.
Treated effluent is pumped off government property for final treatment and disposal at the Rockaway Valley Regional Sewage Authority (RVRSA), a 12-MGD facility in Boonton, New Jersey, five miles away. A standby diesel generator supports the lift station and Picatinny pretreatment facility.

COLLECTION SYSTEM
The existing collection system is generally constructed of vitrified clay and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with manholes at approximately 350-foot intervals. System piping varies from 2-inch force mains to 18-inch gravity flow sewers. Most of the original system was installed in the 1930s and 1940s. The hilly topography of the Installation allows gravity flow of wastewater for short distances followed by lifting. Flows are generally in a southerly direction except for a small collection area that lies south of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) near the Main Gate. The wastewater collection system presently consists of approximately 137,230 feet of trunk sewers, mains, and force mains. The system includes 19 lift stations of many different designs ranging from ejector systems to simplex guide rail submersible pump designs, to dry well triplex systems.

Potable Water System Description
The potable water system, initially constructed in the 1920s, has a current water demand of approximately 500,000 gallons. The system may include, but is not limited to, wells, pump stations, treatment plant, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, pumps, and meters.  Although not connected to the Picatinny potable water system, the potable water treatment facility for the Advanced Warhead Development Facility (AWDF) at Building 642 is included in this privatization study solicitation, and the AWDF potable water treatment facility shall be included with the sale of the Picatinny potable water system, should such a determination be made as a result of the solicitation.

POTABLE WATER PRODUCTION, TREATMENT, AND STORAGE
Raw water is drawn from three main wells, No. 131, No. 410 (refurbished with limited capacity), and No. 302 (recently refurbished). Well water contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethylene (TCE), which are removed in the treatment process.
The water treatment plant (WTP), Building No. 1383, was constructed in the mid-1980s. The WTP is rated at 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and serves only Picatinny Arsenal. Water demand presently averages 500,000 gallons per day (GPD) regardless of season. The New Jersey Department of Environment Protection water permit, which expires 30 April 2008, allows a maximum draw of ground and surface water not to exceed 1,788 million gallons per year or 149 million gallons per month. There are no connections that would permit emergency access to the nearby municipal systems.
Well pumps transfer raw water to a primary surge tank at the treatment facility where three raw-water pumps pressurize three 8-foot diameter x 16-foot long greensand filters. Potassium permanganate and soda ash are introduced into the raw-water flow to begin the iron and manganese removal process. Filter media is regenerated using potassium permanganate solution and greens and media rinse and is backwashed into a 16-foot diameter x 18-foot high backwash storage tank. Filtered water then flows under pressure to an air-stripping tower where TCE is removed followed by chlorination. Fluoridation completes the treatment process. Backwash wastes and residuals are discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Finished water is then pumped through a detention tank (completing the disinfection process) into elevated storage tanks located throughout the distribution system. Two ground-level storage reservoirs (No. 1381 and No. 1382) located at the treatment complex are replenished from the distribution system. An adjacent structure, Facility No.1381-A, houses two fire protection pumps that draw water from the ground storage reservoirs and boost the flow in the potable water distribution system when needed. Standby power for the WTP is furnished by a 450 kW diesel generator set with sufficient capacity to operate treatment-related equipment as well as raw and treated water pumps. The WTP operation includes a small laboratory for analyzing water samples. A master meter at the WTP records gross plant output.
The WTP and distribution system is manned seven days per week, eight hours per day. Several critical elements of the water system are controlled from the WTP by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, utilizing remote terminal units (RTUs).
Three ground storage reservoirs, Tank Nos. 1381, 1382 (mentioned above), and 3214 plus three elevated storage tanks, Nos. 1300, 3141, and 3254 provide a total of approximately 1.5 million gallons of potable water storage. In addition raw water is stored in Tank 1091, a 100,000 gallon elevated tank. Water is pumped to Tank 1091 and is used to supply the water plant, as well as providing water to a series of fire hydrants north of the tank.

POTABLE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY FOR ADVANCED WARHEAD DEVELOPMENT FACILITY (AWDF)
The potable water treatment facility at the AWDF, located in Building 642, is similar to the operation at the Water Treatment Plant at Building 1383. The AWDF treatment facility includes an air stripper with blower, three chemical mixers, and chlorine solution and potassium permanganate for alkalinity feed. The treatment facility also has a green sand filter for iron and manganese removal; monitor equipment for flow, turbidity, pH and cl2; a storage tank; a pressure tank; and, a carbon filter.

POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Due to significant changes in topography, three distinct pressure zones exist within the distribution system: a low-pressure zone (Lower Area), a medium pressure zone (Navy Hill Area), and a high-pressure zone (1300 and 1400 areas). Two pump stations are used in the distribution network: Structure No. 3013, which maintains the water level in Tank 3214 and Structure 1061, an in-line pumping system. A standby generator set, capable of operating a single 100 gallons per minute (gpm) transfer pump, supports Structure No. 3013.
The distribution system is constructed of approximately 217,000 linear feet of water mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The system includes main valves, pressure reducing stations, valve vaults, post indicator valves, monitoring and warning systems, and fire hydrants. The majority of the system was installed prior to 1950 and consists of unlined cast iron. During the late 1990s through the present, projects have been undertaken to replace a significant amount of older pipe. The most recent project,   when completed in the next 12 months, will have installed 33,600 linear feet of ductile iron pipe. No service laterals are included in these additions. The new pipe runs parallel to existing pipe and is connected to this pipe at frequent intervals.  Once laterals to the new lines are completed, the old lines could then be retired. 
The number and location of hydrants are adequate for fire fighting. System valve locations are adequate for isolating sections of the distribution system for repairs.

Service Water System Description
Picatinny employs a service water system that is totally separate from the potable system. The system supplies water for industrial processes, boiler make-up, non-contact cooling, fire suppression, building sprinklers, deluge systems, and flush water for numerous restrooms. The system also provides irrigation for an 18-hole golf course; however, the golf course sub-system is maintained by golf course personnel and is excluded from privatization. Service water is neither treated nor chlorinated since chlorine residuals would be incompatible with some industrial applications.

WATER PRODUCTION AND STORAGE
Raw service water is pumped from two lakes on the Installation. Each lake supplies a separate area of the distribution system resulting in two distinct service water storage and distribution systems. The two systems are not interconnected.
Lake Picatinny, with a volume of 560 acre-feet and a surface area of 100 acres, supplies approximately 95 percent of the service water for the Installation. Three centrifugal pumps located in the Power House (steam generating plant, Building 506) pull lake water through coarse intake screens and fill a cluster of ground storage tanks (623, a, b, c, d, and e). The water is then distributed into the service water system, replenishing ground storage Tanks 75, 75a, 639, as needed. Water levels are monitored visually in the Tank 623 cluster with no telemetry or water level sensors currently in use. Raw service water is not metered at the Power House; however, pump run time records are maintained by Power House personnel, which are then translated in estimates of the volume of water delivered to the system. Estimated pumped volumes average 450,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. Pressures in the lower areas of the average 80 pounds per square inch (psi).
Lake Denmark, with a volume of 1,015 acre-feet and a surface area of 280 acres, provides service water for the 1500 and 3500-3800 areas. Two (2) raw water pumps located in Building 1219 pull water through a coarse screen intake and lift it into Tank 1500 for distribution. Estimated flow, based on pump run times, averages 25,000 to 30,000 gallons per day. The water level in Tank 1500 is monitored remotely at the Water Treatment Plant.

SERVICE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
The service water system consists of approximately 138,000 feet of mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The service water system generally serves those buildings with numbers smaller than 100, 100-900, 1500, 3500, and the 3800 group (approximately 110 buildings). The majority of the system was constructed in the 1940s and has been extended to accommodate additional buildings. Since the water is not treated, there are frequent problems associated with leaking valves that do not seat, water odor, etc. Spent service water, not used for non-contact cooling, is discharged to the sanitary wastewater collection system. A large percentage of the one-pass cooling water is discharged directly to the environment at eight EPA New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES)-permitted outfalls.
Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Interested sources shall contact Montrez Nicholson at (703) 767-9406 to be added to our bidders mailing list.  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance on the Internet at http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246.  The solicitation will be available on or after September 30, 2004.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) located in Baltimore, MD has a requirement for a Financial Institution/Bank contractor to provide banking services to implement and maintain a Third Party Payment System (TPPS) that will allow SSA to issue selected payments using payment instruments.  Payment instruments mean drafts, checks or other similar negotiable instruments will be provided by the Government Printing Office.  The contractor shall service up to 6,000 SSA cashiers in approximately 1,500 SSA offices worldwide.  SSA expects to issue in fiscal year 2004 approximately 390,000 payments equaling an estimated $138,000,000.  The SSA TPPS shall require 1 master account and 15 subsidiary accounts.  The contractor shall provide for an additional 5 subsidiary accounts for future expansion if required.  Each subsidiary account shall have 1-350 subaccounts.  SSA will reimburse the contractor daily on a “payments instruments paid” basis for the amounts on the accounts on the payment instruments with funds made available to the contractor by same day electronic payment or by electronic funds transfer. This requirement will be procured utilizing procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this requirement is 522320.  The size standard is $6.0 million. SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract for this effort.  The period of performance shall be for one year (12 months in duration), with four one-year options, if exercised. This is an unrestricted requirement and proposals from all responsible sources shall be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal will be issued on or about July 7, 2004.  The RFP will be issued under solicitation SSA-RFP-04-1046.  The solicitation and any related documents for this procurement will be made available to interested parties through electronic media for downloading via the internet at Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>By way of this notice and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source contract to the UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS at Urbana-Champaign, IL for the development of a habita t profile for Asian Carp in the Illinois River System and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.  The Contract will require the contractor to define the habitat of the Carp in the Illinois River System both above and below the barrier and through GIS pinpoint th e most likely area that the Carp would habitat.  Under a previously Sole Source acquisition to University of Illinois, the organization was responsible for monitoring and evaluating at the Electric Fish Barrier to Prevent the Dispersal of Aquatic Nuisance Fishes to include the Asian Carp.  The University was a principle in the design of the assessment program and performed the assessment and evaluation of the barrier.  They are uniquely familiar with the operation of the barrier and how to assess the operat ion.  In addition, their affiliation with the Illinois Natural History Survey, makes them experts on the Illinois waterway.  The long history of working on the Illinois waterway means they understand the navigational patterns and procedures and have traine d personnel on staff to navigate the waterway while conducting sampling for the project.   Therefore, we consider this acquisition to be available from one source (University of Illinois).  The contract projected performance period is approximately 12 mont hs.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed price.  This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals; therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued.  Award is anticipated on or about 27 September 2004.  The Point of Contact for th is contractual action is Linda Zamarocy, Contract Specialist at Telephone No. (312) 846-5374 or e-mail to Linda.L.Zamarocy@usace.army.mil.

During the Stage I evaluation, only information on the A/E Design Firm and the Lead Designer(s) is required. Change the Stage I evaluation criteria #2 to read:

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):     The Lead
Designer shall each submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three per project) and a written description (maximum of one per page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer(s). Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

All other information in the original announcement remains the same. The due date and time for proposals remains unchanged. Proposals are due no later than October 4, 2004 by 2:00 P.M. (Central Time).

<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), is pleased to announce the release of the Air Force’s Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field, Florida. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time 14 October 2004, at the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle.  The Air Force intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field project.  The Air Force, with the technical assistance of Jones Lang LaSalle, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the project.  In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  The Air Force, with the technical assistance of Jones Lang LaSalle, will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force Selection Authority.  The Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,155 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,155 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,739 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the SO.  The Government may, consistent with the limitations set forth in the RFP, subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.jllpsc.com/.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles and Materials and Manufacturing Directorates are requesting information and follow-up discussions to support research and development of rapid response imaging spectrometer sensor payloads suitable for integration on a government provided spacecraft bus and interface to government furnished data storage and processing system as part of a rapid development experiment.  The total hyperspectral sensor subsystem should include: telescope; optics; spectrometer including the Focal Plane Array; control and read out electronics; pre-delivery characterization; documentation; and integration support at a government facility.  The completed sensor payload will include a plan for delivery of the flight hardware sensor subsystem to support tactical satellite system concepts with objective development time to launch from 12 to 18 months. 

A classified document has been created that outlines the performance goals of a desired sensor payload. AFRL would like industry response to this document in terms of the areas of highest risk or design trades to meet the overall proposed program objectives. 

AFRL is considering funding development in this specific technology area and is attempting to gauge industry interest and capability.

<DESC>It is the intent of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to identify possible sources and obtain information regarding the possible commercial off the shelf availability of a vessel which can meet the performance requirements stated in Attachment A of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement.  LEAD SHIP:  The attached statement of work applies to the Production and Deployment of the Long Range Interceptor (LRI) Lead Ship. This work includes design engineering and analysis, fabrication and construction work to adapt a commercially available small boat to the current Integrated Deepwater System requirements and the LRI’s parent asset interface requirements (Parent assets for the LRI are the National Security Cutter (NSC) and the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC)).  Modification of an existing commercial product precludes the necessity for the Contractor to complete LRI Concept Design and Preliminary and Contract Design Phases prior to LRI production and deployment.  This RFI is required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the USCG’s Long Range Interceptor program.  This request for information is not a RFP, nor is a RFP available.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals (RFP).  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for meeting the performance requirements identified herein, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal RFP may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a Statement of Interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length, printed on one side only, and double-spaced) on or before October 5, 2004.  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria:  (1) capability and experience in designing and constructing similar vessels; (2) financial capacity to provide similar a vessel on a firm fixed-price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basis; (3) a statement showing an understanding of an obligation to provide up to 40 vessels on a firm fixed-price, IDIQ basis; and (4) a specific written acknowledgement of an understanding of the performance requirements listed in this RFI.  The Government does not intend to issue a conveyance document on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  There will be no site visits.  Statements of Interest must be submitted to Daniel J. Hartinger, Contracting Officer, United States Coast Guard, Systems Integrator Program Office, 1530 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 400, Arlington, Virginia  22209.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO High Gain Antenna (HGA).	The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work for SDO Project High Gain Antenna (464-COMM-LEGL-0053), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification High Gain Antenna (464-COMM-SPEC-0092), and Exhibit 3 – SDO Project Ka-Band High Gain Antenna Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS). This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Specification (Exhibit 2), and DILS (Exhibit 3). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW.  Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment that either describe how a potential offeror’s high gain antenna could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.  2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing high gain antennas.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO High Gain Antenna that will be furnished at this time.

<SUBJECT>T -- Producing an Index of Patents of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and Authority File, 1790-1976
<DESC>Request for Information for Producing
Index of Patents of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and Authority File, 1790-1976.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is issuing this Request for Information for the purpose of conducting market research. The USPTO has a requirement for an electronic fielded, searchable index, or indexes, which will capture the bibliographic data for U.S. patent grants from 1790 through 1976.  This requirement should utilize best practices for use as a web based search file, as a standalone optical disc product, and /or as a printed publication or publications. In fulfilling this requirement, it is expected that an economic model can be developed to eliminate any cost to the USPTO or to the Government.  

Some of the source data for this requirement is available in printed volumes, which are in fragile condition, with crumbling paper, which will eventually result in the loss of data.

This requirement would be a meld of information in the following and other sources:

I.  The annual printed indexes and selected lists form the most recently titled, Index of Patents, Part I, List of Patentees, Issued from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and Part II, Index to Subjects of Inventions, years from 1872 through 1976, variable paging, including entries for about 4,155,000 patent documents.

II.  Early U.S. Patent Data in the United States Serial Set, Dave Morrison, Documents and Microforms Division, Marriott Library, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT   84112; dave.morrison@library.utah.edu

III.  Index of Patents Issued from the United States Patent Office from 1790 to 1873, Inclusive, volumes I, II, and III, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1874, 1951 pages, including entries listing the invention, name of inventor, residence of inventor, date, and number for about 132,000 patent documents.

IV.  A list of Patents Granted by the United States from April 10, 1790, to December 31, 1836, with an Appendix, Containing Reports on the Condition of the Patent Office in 1823, 1830, and 1831, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1872, 805 pages, including entries listing the invention, name of inventor, residence of inventor, and date for about 10,000 patent documents.

V.  Name and Date Patents, July 31, 1790 – July 2, 1836, Patent Office Historical Collection, Reproduced by Patent and Trademark Depository Library Program, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, August 19, 1999, 198 pages, including entries for about 10,000 patent documents.

VI.  Name/ Date Patent Index, typed ledger of X-numbered patents with hand written notations, about 305 pages, including entries for about 9,902 patent documents.

VII.  Early Unnumbered United States Patents 1790 – 1836; Index and Guide to the Microfilm Edition, Research Publications, Inc., Woodbridge, CT, 1980, 693 pages, including entries for about 9,957 patent documents.

It is anticipated that the part of this requirement resulting from source number I above would be fairly straightforward.

For sources numbered II through VI above, the requirement would include all variations of spelling, names, places, and dates; and respectively refer to the patent document number within the identified source.  

Source number VII above was a commercially available, copyrighted product, which is available in the USPTO and in Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries.  The name and date patents are indexed alphabetically by class, subject, patentee name, and chronologically.  Each entry refers to a reel number of an accompanying microfilm image of the name and date patent document.

It should be understood and stated in any response to this Request For Information that any resulting IT product shall contain the following features and rights in data provisions:

A.  All deliverables, where applicable, shall be in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1998;

B.  The USPTO shall have unlimited rights in data as defined in FAR §52.227-14;

C.  In addition, the USPTO will require a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use the electronic file(s) produced;

D.  The USPTO shall have the right to disseminate the file(s) to USPTO international exchange partners without limitations on the use of the data;

E.  The USPTO shall retain the right to use the file(s) in any derivative products produced by the USPTO or its contractors;

[For example, this data may serve as the first step in creating an electronic text version of U.S. patent documents from 1790 through 1967.];

F.  The USPTO shall retain the right to make any Internet based search tool freely available to the public through its Web homepage;

G.  The USPTO shall retain the right to freely distribute any optical disc product(s) or printed document product(s); and,

H.  An acceptable quality assurance plan and schedule shall be developed and maintained with regularly scheduled reports on meeting goals.

It is desirable that:

1.  A browse feature be utilized to find variant spellings of names, place names, and words; and to the extent possible, an authority file, or files, be developed and utilized;  

[These discrepancies (typos) and variant patent document numbers have been caused, in part, by the restoration of patent grant documents necessitated by a disastrous fire in the U.S. Patent Office on December 15, 1836.]

2.  Variant numbering for the same document listed in different sources be accommodated; and to the extent possible, an authority file be developed and utilized;  

[For tracking and data processing purposes, over the years, the name and date patents have been assigned “X” numbers.  There may be discrepancies in the X-numbers assigned to name and date patents listed in various sources.]

3.  An errata, discrepancy, exception report, or reports, be developed and maintained; and when possible and approved, corrections should be made;

4.  Any electronic product should facilitate electronic document retrieval, viewing, and printing;

5.  Source number VII above be included in this requirement, having resolved any and all copyright issues; and that,

6.  This requirement be developed at no cost to the USPTO or the Government. 

It is suggested that any offeror:

a.  Provide information on the marketability of products; and,

b.  Provide cost models to achieve the requirement at no cost to the Government.

Note that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>99--SIX-MONTH EXTENSION OF FACILITIES OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES
<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), on a sole source basis to LB&B Associates, Inc, for an extension to the period of performance not to exceed six (6) months to the existing Facilities Operations and Maintenance Services Contract NAS5-00046 at GSFC located in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The period of performance extension is to commence on December 1, 2004.  Under the current contract, LB&B Associates (LB&B) provides the following facilities operations and maintenance services:	the planning and directing of the Center's overall facilities and maintenance program to provide a physical plant congruent with the needs of its research, development, and operational programs, overall operation and maintenance of all buildings and structures and the equipment contained therein that supports the Center's infrastructure, including mission critical assets, along with engineering planning services, and construction quality control services.  A break in critical services presenting performed by LB&B could seriously jeopardize GSFC property and missions.  LB&B possesses the cumulative knowledge and work experience that will enable the GSFC mission to continue without a break in service on the current contract.  Having to award a new contract and phase-in a new contractor for a short period of time until the follow-on contract is competed and awarded would be extremely disruptive to the Center's facilities management operations, and could severely impact critical mission operations in Buildings 3/13/14/32.	A new contractor's failure to respond quickly and effectively due to an emergency situation could be disastrous to GSFC's mission critical assets.	The existing technical and professional workforce of LB&B is uniquely qualified to maintain uninterrupted service to the Center because of their knowledge of mission critical systems, plant operations, and the overall layout of the buildings and equipment on Center.  NASA deems other contractors unable to master the learning curve necessary to meet the Government's minimum requirement prior to the expiration of the current contract.  Attaining the necessary expertise by other contractors would require unacceptable delays.  This procurement is authorized under (FAR) 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) only one responsible source.  However, any interested sources may contact Carolyn Schmidt, Contract Specialist, in writing at the address referenced above.  All written responses are due by the date referenced under General Information/Response Date, or 15 days from the publication date of this synopsis, whichever is latest.  Written responses may be E-mailed or faxed. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Internet Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:    http:/genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote/html   . Interested firms have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact and their qualifications/capabilities.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency is seeking a dialogue with industry to discuss innovative and environmentally sound methods of transferring some or all of its ownership of a stockpile of Decontamination Solution Number 2 (DS2) to industry for  reuse/reprocessing.  The DS2 stockpile is stored at a Hazardous Material Enclave located at the former Seneca Army Depot in Romulus, New York.  DS2 is composed of 70% Diethylenetriamine, 28% Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether, and 2% NaOH.  Approximately 1. 7 million gallons of DS2 are in storage and are contained in 4 DOT shippable configurations (total packaged gross weight of 22 million pounds).  The material is approximately 16 years old and is being offered to industry because the Army is now employing a lternate decontaminating solutions.  The Government would like to transfer the DS2 to industry as quickly as possible.  The actual amount to be transferred and its schedule for removal from the Enclave site could be negotiable.  This is a market survey and  not a contracting action.  Interested parties should contact Charles A. Comaty, 410-436-3750, e-mail: charles.comaty@apg.army.mil

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-MAPLE for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract/s without discussions.  Therefore, offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.....

Using a computer, the contractor will complete the following steps:  load the images into a computer, by some color variation mark the roofing images to clearly identify damaged sections for future repair needs, and observe and selectively remove false anomalies based on features of the underlying visual image to generate an accurate, high-quality thermographic image survey of at least 4256 x 3600 pixels with a size of at least 6 inches x 8 inches.  The contractor will then compile this information into a detailed printed report with pictures on glossy photographic stock, a CD containing the thermographic survey images in PDF format, and all resulting data analyzing the damage found. The resulting report and data should provide clear images of the selected roofs with roofing structure and leak damage clearly defined by means of a final roofing image and supporting data, detailing areas which have sustained leaks, and subsequently have moisture remaining in the ceiling insulation.  The contractor should then provide us with (3) copies of the report detailing the results of the survey along with (3) copies of a CD with high resolution survey images which can be manipulated to provide a clear measurement of roof damage down to the inch and used in the future as a maintenance tool. The total flat roofing area is equal to 1,120,075 square feet.

Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.

The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.
