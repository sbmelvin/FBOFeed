NASA/GRC has a requirement to procure a SMART80 CHAMBER CONVERSION:   The NASA Glenn Research Center intends to procure the ETS-Lindgren SMART80 Chamber System for the EMI Laboratory at GRC. Under this procurement, the existing 32¡¦x24¡¦x16¡¦ test chamber will be enhanced with hardware and software to allow mode-stirred and mode-tuned testing, according to the RS103 test method, described in MIL-STD-461E. ETS-Lindgren will provide all hardware and software necessary to enable the mode-stirred test to MIL-STD-461E requirements, including all paddles, installation, hardware, software, system checkout and verification testing.  ETS-Lindgren will also perform electrical connections necessary to enable the system to operate.  The GRC EMI Lab is proposing to have ETS-Lindgren perform this task by installing their SMART80 System.  There is also a short timeframe for accomplishing the task and making it operational in time to put it to use in the fall, which would be the required time-frame for the FCF Rack level EMI testing. Technical Rationale: ETS-Lindgren has a long history of work with reverberation chambers, including constructing facilities for NASA-LaRC and the Naval Surface Warfare Center.  The SMART80 uses a patent-pending design of the field stirrer paddle.  The SMARTImm software provides full calibration of the reverberation chamber, creating the necessary performance indicators and reference files which allow the performance of the chamber to be verified in a matter of minutes. 1.

<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to award a sole source procurement to Southwest Fisheries Science Center to provide analysis of the food habits of Pacific Albatros and cephalopod distribution. The basis of the work will be as follows: To conduct a two-part study on the diets of North Pacific albatrosses; a current analysis based on samples collected over the next three nesting seasons, as well as an analysis of historical data based on samples collected and preserved by the USFWS during 1978-81. This latter sample contains all of the unidentified beaks from the Harrison et al. (1983) study. The study will be for three years to incorporate potential interannual variation.  For the current analysis, personnel of the USFWS have already been instructed to collect LAAL and BFAL cough pellets on French Frigate Shoals, Midway Island, Pearl and Hermes Reef, and Kilauea Point during the 2004 nesting season (Beth Flint pers. comm.). Pellets will be collected only when the donor species can be positively identified; each pellet will be individually wrapped in a plastic bag with a data tag indicating date, location and species. We have requested no more than 30 pellets per species per location per year. For STAL samples,  Short-tailed Albatross Recovery Team (START) members will collect samples from nesting islands during surveys at the end of the nesting season, when chicks are ready to depart the island or have already left. At the end of the nesting season (July) pellets will be shipped to Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, CA for preliminary sorting; each pellet requires 3-4 h to remove and clean all prey hard parts (comprised almost entirely of squid beaks). Cleaned hard parts will then be shipped to William Walker in Seattle where the prey will be identified, measured, tabulated and (in most cases) the size of the intact prey calculated from published conversion equations. This process requires another 3 h of processing time per pellet, assuming each pellet contains on average 36 cephalopod beaks (as was the case in Pitman et al., in review). For the historical analysis,  hard parts from a total of 127 pellets (68 BFAL and 59 LAAL) from 4 separate localities: Laysan Island (91), French Frigate Shoals (15), Kure Atoll (15) and Midway Island (6). These will be analyzed as described above. In order to investigate interannual and geographic variation in prey preferences, we propose to collect samples over three years (2004, 2005 and 2006) and from as many different nesting colonies as possible. All results will be summarized in annual reports that will be completed within 6 months of receiving the final shipment of samples from USFWS each year. This notice of intent is not a request for comptetitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made August 6, 2004, following the publication of this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the Institute of Marine Research to provide digital photographs of fish and cephalopods of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The requirement is to support US scientific participation in a research project that seeks to scientifically explore the ecosystems of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The work will involve the identification of captured fish and cephalopod fauna and subsequent capture, transmission and release of digital images of encountered species.   Norway has taken the lead in the MAR-ECO project through the Institute of Marine Research (IMR).  They are conducting the primary field phase of the project with the Norwegian research vessel G.O. SARS in summer of 2004.  Scientists from multiple countries will be participating on the G.O. SARS cruise.  Digital images of captured fish and cephalopods will be collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on 3 sites: the seamount region north of the Azores, the Gibbs Fracture Zone between Iceland and the Azores, and the Reykjanes Ridge, south of Iceland.  Capture methods will involve traps, longlines, trammel nets, midwater and bottom trawls.  In addition, underwater camera systems will be employed in an effort to provide significant advancement toward the knowledge of fish and cephalopod diversity on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The MAR-ECO project effort will be unique in:  a) its use of modern equipment, including a new, state of the art research vessel  b) its expertise through participation by specialists from 16 countries c) it's vast coverage of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which spans from the Azores to Iceland.  As a result, there are no other current projects that will be able to contribute the level of knowledge of fish and cephalopod diversity as that proposed by the Institute of Marine Research.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by August 5, 2004.    Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>NOTE:  In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law.  Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works.  Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry.  They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andulucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price construction contract for Construction of Cargo Marshalling Area Addition.  Contract magnitude is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, jeffrey.powell@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.

<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory is seeking companies interested in a R&D collaboration to sponsor the application of the technology described below to biological molecules.  The ideal candidate will be involved in the mass spectrometry industry as a manufacturer of products or services and have a focus on the life science industry.  The successful company must fund a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (see http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/ibdnew/mechanisms/cradas.htm) in order to gain access to the technology.  Companies can expect rights to intellectual property developed under a collaboration.  Companies interested in pursuing this opportunity should submit a letter of interest to the contact identified below.

Use of a special solid form of silica as a substrate for matrix-free MALDI mass spectrometry 

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has made the characterization of molecules and proteins by mass spectrometry a routine method.  However, the matrix used to help ionize the samples introduces background ions that make characterization difficult, especially for small molecules.  The current invention describes the use of a matrix material that is not ionized with the samples.  This new matrix material has significantly improved MALDI-MS for small molecules, is easy to make and is more durable than existing substrates.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) plans to procure on a sole source basis a Mosquito nano-liquid handling robot for crystallization instrument with Molecular Dimensions, Inc, PO Box 1001, 	Apopka, Florida 32704.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Cell Biology, Macromolecular Crystallography Unit studies structure and function of macromolecular assemblies, especially those related to cancer development, treatment, and prevention, primarily using X-ray crystallographic methodology and requiring a facility for protein crystal growth, for X-ray diffraction experiment and for data collection. X-ray crystallography is the most dominant method in elucidating macromolecular structures at atomic resolution and plays an essential role in our understanding of biological function of proteins at molecular resolution. In order to obtain structural information of a target protein by X-ray diffraction, protein crystals must be obtained.  Our project focuses on the crystallization and structure determination of integral membrane proteins involved in cellular multi-drug resistance (MDR).  In order to expedite the process of structural determination of proteins, or membrane proteins in particular, the robotic approach has been widely used among many structural genomics centers, and the crystallization community is shifting to using 96-well microtitre plates in a sitting drop format to increase throughput.  We would like to purchase a liquid handling robot for setting up 96-well crystallization plates, either in sitting drop or in hanging drop, or in micro-batch format.  The benefits of having a crystallization robot would greatly increase our efficiency in searching large number of crystallization conditions, providing much improved consistency and accuracy with less protein sample (< 0.1  l), and decreasing the time needed to grown highly ordered membrane protein crystals and thus increasing our competitiveness in the field.  Molecular Dimensions, Inc designs and manufactures equipment and reagents, and package these products specifically for protein crystallization experiments.  Mosquito is an exciting new technology for liquid handling that combines the performance of fixed tip dispensers with the convenience of disposable pipettes. Using positive displacement pipetting, Mosquito can dispense volumes from 50 n1 to 1200 nl precisely and reliably, over a wide range of fluid viscosities, and even handle suspensions of beads or cells. Because each micropipette is disposable, Mosquito offers guaranteed, zero cross-contamination of samples and removes the need for time-consuming and expensive solvent wash cycles. Mosquito technology combines the liquid transfer capability of a positive displacement, fixed head pipettor with the convenience and zero cross-contamination of disposable tips. The mosquito has a single reel of standard mosquito tape carrying 36,000 tips, a plate capacity for the crystallography deck containing 2 SBS-format plate positions and a single column position, a pippet pitch of 4.5mm for 384 and 1536 well plates or 9mm for 96 well plates with tip reach of 13 mm.  Molecular Dimension, Inc., is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 6, 2004.  If you have questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40114-NG.

<SUBJECT>D -- Retirement Systems Modernization Defined-Benefit Technology Solution
<SOLNBR>OPM-SOL-04-0000051
<RESPDATE>091004
<ARCHDATE>09252004
<CONTACT>George Leininger, Contract Specialist, Phone 202/606-1598, Fax 202/606-1464, Email george.leininger2@OPM.GOV
<DESC>This is a synopsis issued for a proposed acquisition to be solicited under Full and Open Competition procedures. The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Defined-Benefits Technology Solution for its Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) initiative. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal and price quotation. 

The resulting performance-based contract will enable us to license the use of an existing, proven technology solution from an experienced provider of defined-benefits retirement services. The system will be hosted, maintained, and enhanced by the offeror, reducing the risk we face with a large information technology implementation to modernize OPM’s retirement systems.

The desired solution will provide functionality and processing, and allow us to operate the system with our existing staff resources. We expect to license one or more of a number of already existing proprietary applications that have been designed specifically for defined benefits administration. 

We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a teaming effort. The chosen offeror or offerors will provide software and services that will support our administration of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). The total set of capabilities to be provided will be determined based upon the offeror’s submissions and will weigh the costs, benefits, and risks, including the required degree of customization of the proposed offeror’s solutions. 

The offeror’s solution should support:
1.	claims processing:
2.	annuity payroll processing and recordkeeping; 
3.	member recordkeeping; and
4.	proactive communications to members and annuitants. 

It should also include case tracking capabilities to support reconsideration requests, court order processing, and overpayment collections. The solution should also provide self-service capabilities, such as address changes and tax withholding changes, for annuitants, and provide information to enable our customer service representatives to provide customer service to program participants.

We wish to purchase the services described in the draft solicitation under terms and conditions similar to those that typically apply to similar purchases in the private sector. However, we have unique Federal Government constraints and we must ensure that the services we purchase meet the Federal retirement system’s unique characteristics. We therefore invite interested offerors to review our draft solicitation and provide meaningful comments.

To enhance our final solicitation request, please provide answers to the following questions:

1.	 Please review the draft solicitation, particularly the constraints, which we provide in Attachment 3. Please discuss in detail any constraints or conditions that you view as potentially problematic or have the potential to disproportionately increase the price of the services we are requesting. Provide an explanation of why a particular constraint or condition presents a challenge and suggest an alternative recommendation you think presents less of a challenge and still meets our desired outcome.

2.	We wish to secure the benefits of competition, both in terms of pricing and delivery quality, over the life of any contract that may arise from this competition. Therefore, we are contemplating and will consider making a single award (a teaming effort) or multiple awards, in which more than one vendor will receive an award and the population of retirement accounts may be divided among those vendors. Over the life of the contract, we may choose to redistribute retirement accounts among vendors based on price or service quality.

Please comment on our proposed approach and identify any implications and describe the risks and rewards associated with such an approach.

3.	We wish to allow vendors flexibility in defining the structure of their offers, while still maintaining comparability among offers.

Please review the pricing instructions in the draft solicitation (Section B), and comment on whether our form and structure provides you sufficient flexibility to define the elements of a solution in a meaningful way that will be manageable over the life of the contract. Also, please also provide a preliminary outline of the components of your solution by completing the first four columns of Attachment 1, Contract Worksheet, and the first three columns of Attachment 2, Performance Requirements Summary Template. 

4.	Also provide any additional comments on the draft solicitation that you think we should consider to ensure a healthy competition among prospective offerors and provide prospective offerors with the necessary information to effectively develop a response to this solicitation. 

5.	We would like to restrict the size of the proposal packages we receive to ensure an efficient evaluation. 

Please comment on whether the number of pages allowed in Section L is sufficient to enable a complete response to the solicitation. 

6.	The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). The corresponding Small Business Administration size standard for this NAICS code is $21.0 million in average annual receipts. In these terms, is your company a large or a small business?

While it is not mandatory that offerors provide responses to these questions, we are interested in industry comment on this draft solicitation and encourage you to submit comments and question. We will consider your comments and questions when finalizing the solicitation. However, we will not disclose any questions and comments that are submitted, except as required by FAR 15.201(f).

Please send your comments and questions on this draft solicitation to George Leininger, Contract Specialist, either in hardcopy or email, our preferred method.  We listed the Contracting Office and email addresses above in this synopsis.  Your response to this request is due no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, August 6, 2004.

We provided technical data and background information relevant to the RFP in Section J of the draft. 

Place of Performance:    	United States
Duration of the contract period:    	Various, maximum of ten years if all option periods are executed
Delivery Schedule:	To be determined by the offeror

We anticipate issuing the final solicitation on or about August 23, 2004. Proposals will be due on or about September 10, 2004. An additional opportunity for questions will be offered. Our award decision will be based on a best-value determination: All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. Demonstrations of software solutions may be required. Anticipated contract award date is December 16, 2004.

The offeror shall comply with the following general considerations in high containment:  (1) areas and spaces where animals will be processed before, during and after scan procedures shall operate under the guidelines of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 4th Edition (BMBL), CDC/NIH; all standard practices and special practices as outlined in the BMBL for ABSL-4 suit laboratories and for ABSL-4 vertebrate animal holding shall be practiced as standard operating procedures; (2) primary containment, as outlined in the BMBL, will be adopted where possible for limiting aerosol generation of infectious agent and preventing cross-contamination with other experiments.  As such, animals will wherever feasible, be kept in primary containment devices, including during imaging procedures; (3) separation of containment and non-containment zones shall be by a containment barrier; the barrier shall be constructed such that it can meet air tightness criteria (pressure decay test) and withstand chemical corrosiveness testing common for all containment spaces in this project as contained in the BMBL guidelines.  Construction of the containment barrier shall be by the General contractors unless the required equipment forms part of the containment barrier; those parts of the equipment forming the barrier and exposed to the contaminated side shall perform to the same standards as the rest of the barrier; (4) install all feasible equipment parts in non-containment space, separated from the containment zone and orient equipment so that regular and long-term maintenance can be performed without entering the containment zone and (5) maintenance and calibration that can not be performed outside the containment zone shall be performed either once annually (post fumigation of space) or shall be performed in compliance with the standard and special practices as described in the BMBL for BSL-4 suit laboratory space.  To minimize the footprint within the containment area, locate all support equipment and support space in the service floor directly above the magnet or gantry as feasible.  The offeror must comply to the following specific high containment design issues:  (1) containment barrier -  (a) isolate of bore/gantry space; (i) separate the animal (patient) zone from the equipment magnet bore space or gantry and develop with the project design team separation containment by means of a sealed tube extension of the containment barrier; modify equipment (removal of cladding, etc.) to provide enough space inside tube for group 2 non-human primate that is inside isolation device; (ii) assist project design team in designing animal isolator and provide information with respect assist is integration of RF coils within isolator design; (iii) develop calibrated movement system (table mechanics) within containment “tube.” and (iv) visual access of the animal patient is required by the person at remote controls (may be via CCTV); (b) cable routing across containment barrier – (i) assist the project design team in designing all cable penetrations across the containment barrier; (ii) wiring and cable penetrations across the containment barrier must be constructed to meet containment barrier performance criteria; typically, cable shielding will be stripped to expose conductor; solid conductors, not multi-stranded, are preferred and may be required; conductors are encased in epoxy or other material resistant to chemical typically used in containment environments to provide a gas-tight penetration and (iii) provide redundant cabling for future applications.  Unless cables can be changed out, provide 100% redundancy of all conductors; (2) controls and interfaces:  (a) separation of animal procedure and control space; (i) equipment controls and data capture will be separated from animal patient procedure room.  Controls will be operated form outside containment.  Separate animal handler will process animal patient in the equipment.  (ii) animal handler may need to work with, modify the animal patient’s physical and metabolic condition before, during and after a scan procedure, including administration of additional.   Assist the design team to work through these procedures and confirm the ability to safely and efficiently do same (this is not anticipated to require equipment modification at this time); (b) equipment Controls and Operation: (i) customize equipment controls where practical to operate outside the containment zone; (ii) where controls and user interface are required in the containment zone, ensure that the operation is manageable in a BSL-4 suit laboratory environment; (iii) controls, including electronics and switches that are installed in the BSL-4 suit environment must be able to withstand fumigation decontamination processes or must be able to be easily disconnected and stored when the general space undergoes decontamination; (c) communication between control space and animal handler; (3) Decontamination; (a) Fumigation; (i) investigate compatibility with current fumigation methods for decontamination, including paraformaldehyde, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  Assist the design team in integrating decontamination strategies with equipment; (ii) modify equipment to promote complete surface fumigation decontamination.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NIH Stem Cell Unit (SCU), plans to procure a RX-650 portable x-ray system from Faxitron X-Ray Corporation, 225 Larkin Drive, Suite 1, Wheeling, Il  60090. The SCU is dedicated to characterizing and comparing the available federally approved human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. The primary aim is to establish standards for all aspects of the culture process as well as quality control and monitoring. Currently, all hESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).  This particular x-ray machine will allow us to X-ray irradiate MEFs quickly and routinely with less variation or other side effects which are potential hazards of chemical inactivation. The required instrument shall have a shelfed chamber on which tubes of cells would be placed. The individual researcher must have control over the dosage of irradiation from 5500 to 8,000 rads.  This machine must be able to deliver 8,000 rads for a period shorter than fifteen (15) minutes to minimize the length of time cells are outside of culture conditions during irradiation.  In addition, the instrument must be compact and portable as it will be used by a number of laboratories.  These are some of the features required by the program that are believed to be unique to the Faxitron X-Ray Corporation RX-650:  1) >500 Rad/min so that a dosage of 8000 rads can be delivered in less than 15 min.;  2) the machine is “self-cooling” so that no external source of coolant is needed;  3) the radiation dosage can be very finely adjusted by changing the dosimetry at 1kVp increments;  4) a motor driven turntable, which provides a means of improving uniformity of the absorbed radiation dose;  5) the machine’s relatively small size allows easy placement in the Lab and easy transportation.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 3, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NIACS 334517, Size Standard 500.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: RESTRICTED TO HAWAII AND GUAM 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII AND GUAM. (No solicitation will be available. This is an announcement that is open indefinitely.) The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from Hawaii and Guam 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program. (If you are currently a Hawaii or Guam-Based BOA Holder, no further action is required on your part.) BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the Hawaii and Guam BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls only). The NAICS Sectors covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sectors 236 (formerly 233), 237 (formerly 234), and 238 (formerly 235)for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military and government installations on the Islands of Hawaii, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. freely-associated island-nations of the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.

<DESC>This is the SECOND amended Pre-Solicitation Notice.  (The first amended Pre-Solicitation Notice was published in FedBizOpps on June 25, 2004.  And the initial Pre-Solicitation Notice was published in FedBizOpps on June 10, 2004).  This SECOND amended Pre-Solicitation Notice is being issued for the purpose of modifying the educational requirements previously published for two of the project's labor categories.  The modified educational requirements are as follows:  (a) A Principal Engineer should have an advanced engineering degree, but must have a bachelors degree in engineering at a minimum preferably in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or physics; and (b) A Senior Engineer must have a technical degee preferably in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or physics.  The previously-published educational requirements for the Junior Staff remain un-changed.  The previously-published work experience requirements for all labor categories remain un-changed.  This sentence concludes the Second Amended Pre-Solicitation Notice.


SYNOPSIS
Engineering Support for the ITS Program

Scope

THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.   A non-profit organization is one which is not organized primarily for profit but which is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest, and which uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, and/or expand it operations.  The contract resulting from this procurement will provide the engineering support to the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  The ITS program is a research and development activity budgeted at approximately $100 million annually, and it encompasses the entire range of technologies currently known as ITS.

The incumbent contractor currently providing this support is the Mitretek Corporation, under Contract No. DTFH61-00-C-00001.  Mitretek is eligible to compete under the new procurement here synopsized.  

Special Requirements

The contractor will have access to a variety of sensitive material as a result of the support activities.  Typically the contactor will be involved in the following types of program activities:

1	Technical support in the development of Statements of Work and specifications for projects.
2	Evaluation of proposals submitted to execute the projects.
3	Development of program plans for areas of ITS research.
4	Monitoring of contractors’ performance in the execution of projects.
5	Technical evaluation of contractors’ work products resulting from these projects.
6	Technical analyses that are required to develop a project plan prior to the issuance of a solicitation for the project.
7	Provision of technical advice on the state of the art in certain technologies.

Because of the crucial need for impartiality as well as the APPEARANCE of impartiality in the performance of such work, each PRIME offeror (and the resulting PRIME contractor) must be a non-profit organization.  Profit-oriented INDIVIDUALS operating as INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS, may, however, be proposed by any offeror and may be used by the contractor.  The contractor must agree to NOT compete for ANY commercial ITS work, whether it be for a private or public entity seeking that work, during the Period of Performance of this contract and for one year thereafter.


Personnel Requirements

It is anticipated that this procurement will require approximately 80,000 AGGREGATE staffing hours of effort annually.  The personnel should be fundamentally systems engineers with a working knowledge of ITS systems.  The technical experience and background of the personnel will encompass at least the following disciplines:

	Traffic Engineering
	Modeling and system analysis
	Traffic Signal control Systems
	ITS Architecture
Public Transit Systems
Public Safety Systems
Collision Avoidance technologies
Evaluation of Project Effectiveness
Commercial Vehicle systems (CVISN)
ITS Standards and Standards Development Procedures
Communications Technologies
Traveler Information Systems
Transportation Safety Technologies

It is anticipated that AT LEAST one principal engineer with at least 10 years of experience will be required in each of the above disciplines.  It is estimated that the contract will include a total of about 15 or 16 different individuals occupying the position of principal engineer.  Since this work is aimed at assisting the ITS JPO in formulating the ITS program, the task requires that at least half of the technical staff (i.e., persons employed below the level of principal engineer) be senior people with more than five years of experience in at least one (and preferably in several) of the above disciplines.

The personnel categories required are as follows:

Principal Engineers -----------------------  30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
A principal engineer will have an advanced degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or physics and at least ten years of experience.  The principal engineer will be expected to be capable of leading a group of engineers in the development of program plans and recommending technical options to the JPO staff.


Senior Engineers  ----------------------30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
          A senior engineer will have a degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or civil engineering.  However, a civil engineer must have prior experience in the implementation of ITS technologies.  Senior personnel are expected to be able to coordinate projects and provide seasoned judgment for the JPO staff.

Junior Staff  -------------------------------15,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
	Junior staff members are expected to be degreed engineers who can perform analyses, research, and the evaluation of technical products. 

It is expected that administrative support will comprise about 6% of the total labor on these tasks, since administrative support of the JPO staff is not the objective of this procurement.  Accordingly:

Administrative Support-------------5,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.

All estimated numbers of aggregate hours as shown above are expressed as actual ON-THE-JOB hours.  The DUE DATE for the FHWA’s receipt of proposals, as shown above, is only an ESTIMATED due date.  The ACTUAL due date for receipt of proposals will be shown hereafter in the SOLICITATION (RFP) No. DTFH61-04-R-00029, that will be published in this same FedBizOpps web site.  Prospective offerors are strongly advised to MONITOR this FedBizzOpps web site on a regular basis in order to look for any AMENDMENTS to this Synopsis, that might be published hereafter.

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather th

Mr. Ellison may be contacted at 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095, or EMAIL  ellison_db@crane.navy.mil .  an a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that  provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as identified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem drawings.  7.

ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 35:  There is no specific requirement for run time; however, a best value determination, with run time being a factor, will be made prior to contract award.  No run time data is available for current prod ucts. QUESTION NO. 36:  The request is for improved performance/reflectivity on green and black targets. What is the current effective range and what is the desired practical range the user desires to have?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 36:  See Performance Specification (Para.  3.3.2.3.3.1) QUESTION NO. 37:  What is the weight and size of the system that is currently being used?  What are the size weight targets?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 37:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.3.3.7) The current system measures 2.84 in x 2.54 in x 1.52 in and weighs 3 oz with batteries.  No specific targets have been set.  The system should be packaged as small as possible to not sacrifice performance. QUESTION NO. 38:  What patterns is being used?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 38:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification.  Patterns are not required for the visible laser, but w ill be considered, if offered. QUESTION NO. 39:  How many more are needed?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 39:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification. QUESTION NO. 40:  What pulse cycles are being used what other cycles would be needed? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 40:  Not applicable.  This is an ITPIAL specification.  Pulse capability is not required for the visible laser, but will be considered, if offered. QUESTION NO. 41:  What ruggedization improvements in particular are you asking for?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 41:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.4) QUESTION NO. 42:  What are the make and models of the systems that are currently being used? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 42:  Insight Technologies, Inc., Carbine Visible Laser, AN/PEQ-5, NSN: 5860-01-439-5409 QUESTION NO. 43:  What are the shortcomings that you want improved? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 43: See P erformance Specification, it describes the objective system.  QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPP’s.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPP’s are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an “all in one package” more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed “all-in-one” solution must meet all of the KPP’s for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APP’s are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the “double tap” feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A “double tap” feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength spec

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification. STATEMENT OF WORK CHANGES: 1) Paragraph 3.2.4 Operator’s Manual:  Paragraph title renamed and simplified to reference MIL-PRF-63016B(TM), which is consistent with the Performance Specificat

ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for, technology assessment, program management and engineering services support for Increment 1 development of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) system to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent non-profit organization, of Johnstown, PA. The period of performance will be for two years. The proposed contract will provide for both term form and completion form delivery orders and will contain Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions that prohibit the contractor from participating in production of the DJC2 Increment 2 and beyond systems. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. CTC, as an independent non-profit corporation, has established itself as DOD’s indepe ndent third-party technology verification center. This unique competence has been used on numerous occasions by the DOD to ensure accurate and independently verified decisions are being made to transfer the optimum technology to DOD installations.  This competence has also been used to certify the performance of materials and equipment for addition to the DOD buyers list.  Additionally, CTC has been intimately involved in the design, development and deployment of the DJC2 prototype.  The DJC2 delivery schedule is compressed and critical.  It is imperative that CTC’s experience with the DJC2 prototype be leveraged to prevent program duplication and unacceptable delay.   Additionally,  CTC operates four major Defense Centers of Excellence:  the National Center for Excellence in Metalworking Technology (NCEMT); the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE); the  National Applied Software Engineering Center (NASEC); and the Systems Of Systems Engineering Center of Excellence (SoSECE).  These centers maintain essential capabilities in materials and processing, environmental engineering, electronic commerce, information management, software engineering, Systems of Systems Engineering, laboratory operations and techniques, and structured training for technicians, professionals, and others. This provides DJC2 with access to capabilities directly applicable to technology transition.  CTC provides a means for applying critical advanced environmental, manufacturing, information, and software technologies to the solution of technical problems that directly face DJC2 during Increment 1. CTC has developed state-of-the-art technology and services in virtual reality, 3-D scientific visualization and collaborative engineering to provide cost-effecti ve solutions that support the decision-making process that are of direct interest to the DJC2 development phase. These technological services have been applied to a variety of domains including battlefield visualization and simulations, process and product design, real-time network monitoring, mission familiarization and architectural design.  NAICS Code is 541330.  Contract Specialist: John Miller, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 (904) 235-5399, FAX (904) 234-4251.   Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are required  we would like to have the information by 15 Aug 04 to incorporate into the POE.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.   For more information on PRV--Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/PRV/PRV.asp

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. James R. Milligan, AFRL/IFTB, telephone: (315) 330-3013, email:    James.Milligan@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development of a Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) fuselet production environment. Specifically, this effort will develop a fuselet production environment as specified in the Fuselet Definition Document provided at the following URL: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/jbi/documents/fuselet_definition.doc.  However, this solicitation seeks only to implement the necessary subset of those fuselet capabilities described in the Fuselet Definition Document to meet the following objectives.  The fuselet production environment will:  (1)  Interoperate with an AFRL supplied implementation of the JBI (Java-based).  (2)  Be JBI Common Application Programmer Interface (CAPI) compliant, and produce fuselets that are CAPI compliant.    Java bindings to the CAPI can be found at http://www.infospherics.org/. (3) Provide a fuselet authoring capability that allows the production of fuselets from a library of components.  (4) Support the creation of these logic components (primitives) themselves.  (5) Produce a portable definition (e.g., XML) of a fuselet that is machine independent and machine readable for the purposes of compilation.  Fuselets will be self-describing.  (6)    Provide a compilation capability to generate stand-alone clients (fuselets) based on their self-description.    By "stand-alone", we mean that the fuselets generated will not be required to run directly on the JBI Platform, as described in the Fuselet Definition Document.    Only rudimentary capabilities for a fuselet server and runtime management environment that do not require JBI Platform resources are anticipated to be developed as a part of this effort.
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Rome Research Site/IFTB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-08-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 07. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY05, FY06, and FY07 should be submitted by 1 Oct 2004, 1 Oct 2005, and 1 Oct 2006 respectively.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.    Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value -Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.

<CONTACT>TANGEE BROOKIE PURCHASING AGENT 3032369322     tbrookie@usgs.gov;
<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O. Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail:  tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Kansas District, has a requirement for an online automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) workstation compatible with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) analysis.  The system must be capable of unattended concentration, manipulation, and injection of samples, which include trace-level herbicides and insecticides from water.  The following specifications must be met:  1.  Must have on-line capabilities, which allow fully automated extraction of samples using 10um C-18 and other phase packing materials.  These capabilities allow for effective extraction of target compounds while eliminating several procedural steps, producing improved precision and preventing operator error.  2.  The system must be a closed system, leading to reduction of material and solvent cost, and reduction of emission and/or disposal of solvents, which may be hazardous.  In addition, total sample extracts are analyzed, allowing for lower limits of detection.  3.  The system must have the capability to use up to 15 solvents for conducting and elution of cartridges and for delivery of the sample to the analytical instrument.  This is necessary for methods development for pesticides.  4.  Must have a chilled autosampler, flexible and precise injection procedures, dual needles and a multiple port valve (at least six ports) for multiple washes with different solvents.  Must be able to hold 10 ml sample vials.  5.  The software and hardware must be compatible with Agilent and Waters Corp. laboratory instruments.  6.  The software must work over a Windows NT or 2003 network.  7.  Must have an automated SPE cartridge unit with at least three switching valves and have the capability to hold up to 96 cartridges.  Must work with the Prospekt style cartridges.  8.  Must have a high pressure mixing unit and at least two solvent selection manifolds.  9.  Must be able to extract 10 ml of sample in one injection and hold a 10 ml sample for processing without contaminating solvent rinse and mobile phase lines.  10.  Must be able to store multiple solvent bottles.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers this to be a sole source requirement from Spark Holland, Inc., 666 Plainsboro Rd., Plainsboro NJ, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), Office of the Chief Information Officer is seeking sources able to provide independent contractor consultant services to support activities related to the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) new headquarters building.  DOT is seeking independent consultant support services for telecommunications and network infrastructure design and design review activities.  The DOT is in the process of planning relocation from its current headquarters in Washington, DC, at 400 Seventh Street, SW, to a new facility located at the Southeast Federal Center.  The new facility will have two connected towers supporting approximately 20,000 voice ports and approximately 15,000 data ports servicing and estimated 5,600 occupants.  As a part of its planning and design efforts, DOT requires experienced telecommunications and network infrastructure design and design review expertise to supplement its current staff capabilities.  The work performed will be primarily within the Washington DC metropolitan area, but may be performed at other locations within the United States.  Work will be performed primarily at the Contractor’s site, although site visits to the Government’s location for information and meetings will be necessary.  The qualified, independent consulting firm will research and prepare a strategic and tactical IT telecommunications and network alternatives and plans, including but not limited to design configurations, cost estimates, and implementation management test and evaluation plans.  The effort is composed of several independent phases, performed sequentially and/or in parallel, that evolve into cohesive, integrated IT telecommunications and network design and tactical solution consistent with the DOT’s new headquarters building IT infrastructure and operational environmental requirements.  Phases may consist of semi-independent sub parts, depending up on an acceptable approach.  The consultant would be responsible for all aspects of developing, documenting, reviewing, evaluating, and presenting Phase I consistent with its requirements.  The consultant would work with Government and other contractor personnel to accomplish Phase I tasks.  The consultant would coordinate all activities with the Government’s point of contact for the applicable work.  Each Phase will typically include discovery, requirements development, cost estimates, alternatives and analysis, plan preparation, briefings and documentation.  The results of each Phase, or major sub-part if applicable, will be reviewed by the Government for approval and incorporation into its new headquarters building IT infrastructure and operational environment.  Phase I, Integration Strategy, involves development and presentation of a strategic approach and tactical alternatives to completing the remaining Phases.  Based on the Government’s review and acceptance of Phase I, the Government may or may not exercise an option to execute other Phases.  It should also be noted that the specific requirements and deliverables associated with Phase II, Telecommunications Technology Alternatives, Phase III, Network Infrastructure Configuration Alternatives, and Phase IV, Interfaces and Components, may change to some extent based on the outcome of Phase I work.  The Government may add, delete, modify, amend or otherwise adjust Phases II through IV requirements, deliverables and/or tasking to meet its evolving needs.
Only small business sources interested in this requirement should send relevant background information establishing technical ability and a description of their independence as a consultant, work performed as such, and methods to assure such independence and any commercial literature such as description of the services offered, and any other necessary information that demonstrates the above requirements can be met.  Information should be submitted (two copies are requested) by 4:00 PM EST, August 3, 2004, to the Department of Transportation, OST Acquisition Services, 400 7th Street, SW, Room 5106, Washington, DC 20590, to the attention of Deborah Rincon.  Sources are cautioned that only uniformed carriers (US Postal Service, FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc) are allowed access to the building.  DOT will NOT accept email submissions and employees of DOT will NOT be responsible for retrieving submissions at the door.  Sources must indicate whether they are 8a, HUBZONE certified, or a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned small business under NAICS 54151.  The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  RESTRICTED TO 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII.  The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program.  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Office.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to a chosen few contractors for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer.  The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.  The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).

The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated.  Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation.

Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.  ORDERS:  Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.  Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.  LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Provide 8(a) Certification.  (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) solicited by the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) Computing Services (CS) for Report Distribution Services Software (RDS).  DISA CS is in the process of building a Statement of Work (SOW) to competitively acquire a report distribution tool.  To complete the internal process, we must build a business case to justify the purchase.  Accomplishment of this requires information from you as the vendor.

NOTE:  This is not a portion of the Statement of Work and will not be utilized for product evaluation.  The requested information is simply to assist us with obtaining tailored industry knowledge of report distribution products as well as with obtaining a ballpark budget estimate for your product(s).

DISA CS has a requirement to provide software for the capture, archival, distribution, viewing, and management of documents throughout the enterprise.  DISA CS expects the product(s) to provide superior performance, regardless of the application, platform, or the destination device requirements.  This product shall provide a complete solution for z/OS report output and have the potential to also handle documents from distributed environments.  The scope of this initiative is to establish and implement an enterprise wide, z/OS-centric reporting solution.

DISA CS is dedicated to providing a Standard Operating Environment (SOE).  The SOE is the accredited family of common computer hardware, executive software and policy/procedures that form the total operating environment. The primary objective of the SOE is to provide the most efficient processing environment to DISA CS customers at the least possible cost. A mature SOE capable of hosting and interfacing legacy applications and open system DII Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant systems will better support application interoperability and technology infusion.

In order to accomplish report distribution today, DISA CS manages, operates, and in some cases has developed, software applications across a wide range of computing environments including mainframe, client/server and web. These applications have evolved independently over time and do not adhere to a consistent architecture.   This inconsistency adversely impacts the cost of operations and maintenance, the ability for end-users to receive timely and accurate information, and the ability of the technical staff to accommodate changes, issues, or requests.

The objective of the Report Distribution Services (RDS) project is to create a single integrated solution that is accessible worldwide, shares consistent data and processes, and distributes accurate and easily retrievable reports for all DISA CS customers.  As a result, the enterprise will achieve cost savings, boost employee productivity, and derive workflow benefits from tighter integration between the document advances of hardcopy devices and business process software workflows.  Any candidate solutions shall include a total life cycle management program that capitalizes on available commercial support and an available service delivery environment that will best meet our requirements given a total life cycle management approach from design to decommissioning.

This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.

<RESPDATE>060102
<CONTACT>Donald Ellison, Contracting Officer, 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.

Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

<DESC>Subject:  KC-135 Toilet Assembly Kit Sources Sought & ROM.  

Description:  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.  A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  A REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  Due to the increased age, unsanitary design and limited capabilities of the current toilet on-board the KC-135 aircraft, the USAF is investigating alternatives currently on the market.  USAF is searching for a cheap, proven design that is already certified airworthy by the DoD or FAA.  The toilet should, at a minimum, meet the following requirements:

1.   Increased capacity versus the current 4.5 gallon system..
2.   Fit in to a floor space of 40 inches by 48 inches.
3.   Allow servicing through use of ground servicing “suck-trucks”.  It is acceptable to   plumb this connection inside the fuselage instead of adding an external port.
4.   Be self-cleaning after every use.
5.   Be able to be cleaned, sanitized and disinfected with commercially available chemicals.
 7.  Combustible materials must meet requirements of FAR 25.853 and 25.1359.  
 8.  Be corrosion resistant. 
 9.  The toilet must meet all standards in MIL-STD-810F Change 3, including certification for use in explosive atmospheres.
10.  Use either AC or DC power for the toilet assembly.  AC power shall be obtained from the aircraft’s AC power bus; DC power shall be obtained from the aircraft’s switched DC power bus.

This request for information and an associated ROM for the effort shall not be deemed to commit the Government to contract for the subject effort.  Your response to the above, as well as any additional information or opinions you choose to furnish, will be greatly appreciated and will be considered as OC-ALC formulates and executes its strategy for this initiative.  POC:  OC-ALC/LCM, Attn: Shirley Harper, Tinker AFB OK 73145, phone (405) 736-5749, e-mail Shirley.Harper@tinker.af.mil, not later than 18 Aug 2004.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will not receive a response.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is currently preparing research and development program plans for the detection and identification of nuclear and radioactive materials in support of DoD efforts in countering terrorism, counter-proliferation, and nonproliferation. The goal of these program plans is to improve detection and identification capabilities for uranium, plutonium and other nuclear and radioactive materials of interest that do not rely on ionizing radiation signatures.  DTRA is interested in technologies that will provide signatures relatively unique to radioactive material or radiation fields.  Passive and active radiation detection systems are not the subject of this request for information because the US Government has extensive efforts in that area.  In particular, DTRA is interested in possible methods to detect such materials at a distance of over a kilometer in both shielded and unshielded configurations in kilogram-scale quantities.  Methods that might be of interest include, but are not limited to, optical, laser, radar, mass, or acoustic techniques either alone or in combination with each other or with some information systems technology.  All technologies that are not primarily based on passive or active nuclear radiation detection signatures for detection and identification may be submitted in response.  Neither near term deployment or extensive testing is a prerequisite for consideration under this request for information, although both would be desirable.  Techniques can be ground, air, sea, or satellite based.  Each concept should provide some analysis or experimental results indicating some possibility of standoff detection of nuclear materials at least by reference.  An operational deployment concept indicating how the concept would be realized, including distance and quantity would greatly assist evaluation.  Any and all organizations (commercial, academic, non-profit, etc.) conducting research and development in such material detection and identification areas are encouraged to respond to this synopsis. Responses shall be no longer than five pages, size 12 font, and shall be in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word format. Documents shall be provided in electronic form to the technical point of contact at DTRA, Attn:  TDND/CPT Steven Frederiksen, via e-mail: Steven.Frederiksen@dtra.mil no later than 30 August 2004.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by DTRA. DTRA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is contemplating issuing a request for proposals for the attached statement of work.  Before an RFP is released, USAMRAA would like to gain insight from industry regarding this SOW.  Wh ile we would appreciate all comments regarding this SOW, we are particularly interested in the feasibility of the SOW and your estimate of the cost for this acquisition (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives.   Statement of Work.  For many years the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and its predecessors declined extramural sources of funds for military relevant research.  The Command believed that competing for outside funding wou ld be a major distraction that would dilute the energy and resources of military scientists, distract the researchers from their highly focused military missions, and would primarily benefit the outside source rather than USAMRMC.  This was the prevailing belief until the advent of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-502; 15 USC 3710a), which encouraged the USAMRMC to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA's) with outside academic and business organizations.  It s oon became apparent that important basic and supportive research that had been put off for lack of financial support was now affordable, and the working relationships were highly synergistic.  Large clinical trials that were previously considered too expen sive to conduct or had to be put off for years were now easily done because of the availability of outside funds and resources.  CRADAs were established and the research conducted without any erosion of the Command's missions and, in the main, benefited th e Government's research and technology programs.  Ultimately, the benefits of cooperative research have accrued to the American soldier.  In light of these successes, it is now evident that a Sponsored Research Program similar to those of universities and non-governmental organizations would be in the best interest of the Command and a beneficial way to augment the performance of military medical research.  In order to implement such a program, the USAMRMC proposes to hire a contractor to set-up and maintai n a Sponsored Research Support Program on a trial basis of two years for its largest laboratory, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, (WRAIR), located in Silver Spring, MD.  This two-year period will be the proof of concept for potentially expanding  this opportunity, in a new award, for providing this service to all of the USAMRMC laboratories and research areas. The Awardee, shall, as a Contractor and not as agent of the Government, provide the following services and materials.  a.  Conduct analysis of potential sources of grant funding to finance forecasted and existing research projects of the WRAIR, to include its subordinate units; USAMRU-E (U.S. Army Medical Research Unit - Europe, Heidelberg, Germany), AFRIMS (Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand), USAMRU-K (U.S. Army Medical Research Unit - Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya), USAMRD (U. S. Army Medical Research Detachment, Brooks City Base, San Antonio, TX), USADRD (Chicago, IL).  b.  Provide the staff necessary to: (1) prepare and submit proposals for grant funding that supports the WRAIR researcher and research objectives, (2) assist th e WRAIR Researcher, as requested, in writing grant proposals, and (3) provide grant management and administrative support to the Principal Investigator (PI), as necessary.  1.  Grant Opportunities Analysis  a.  Within 90 calendar days after contract award,  the Awardee shall, as a contractor and not as an agent of the Government, compl ete a draft analysis to identify potential funding opportunities offered by other federal agencies, foundations, industry, and other non-USAMRMC sources which align with WRAIR research missions.  b.  Within 30 calendar days after the submitting the draft a nalysis, the Government will review and provide changes to the draft analysis.  Within 14 calendar days after receiving Government's changes to the analysis, the Awardee shall publish the analysis in final form.  The Awardee shall then provide updates to t he plan every 90 days thereafter and incorporate any Government Changes to the plan.  The Awardee shall provide the draft plan, final plan, and updates to the COR, in a Microsoft Word compatible format, via CD, Diskette, or e-mail.   2. Marketing and Promo ting The Awardee shall market and promote the WRAIR research capabilities with granting agencies, institutions, industries, and foundations using the information provided in the Analysis and capitalizing on windows of opportunity as they arise.  The market ing and promotion can be through displays at conferences, printed promotional materials, cold calling and meetings with granting officials of granting agencies, industry, institutions, and foundations.  All material used by the Awardee shall be reviewed an d critiqued by the USAMRMC Public Affairs, Legal Office, Contacting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Representative within 14 days of submission.  3. Support to the WRAIR Principal Researcher  a. The Awardee shall maintain regular contact with WRAIR t hrough the Associate Director, Research Marketing, Policy and Development and WRAIR Researchers.  The Awardee shall establish and maintain systems, which will assist in matching granting agencies, industries, institutions and foundations with WRAIR's resea rch objectives.  b.  The Awardee will provide assistance to the PI for grant proposal strategy planning, grant proposal preparation, and grant administration.

If any subcontractors are to be used, they must all be specified in your response.  Please respond by email only to Viann Colebank, Procurement Technician at viann.colebank@usace.army.mil. Questions should go to David Ebner, Contract Specialist at 503-808-4611.  This query ends on 03 AUG 2004. 1.  GENERAL DESCIPTION The US Army Corps of Engineers (COE) operates several hydropower dams in the Pacific Northwest.  We are looking for contractors who can provide engineering and testing services involving hydropower unit performance modeling for main generating units owned by the Seattle, Walla Walla and Portland District COE.  The work may include the development of proper machine models and parameters for generators, governors and excitation systems suitable for system studies and the field verification testing of the mode ls. 2.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION The Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) issued guidance in its March 21, 1997 letter entitled, Testing of Synchronous Unit Reactive Limits and Dynamic Testing/Model Validation, whereby it requires member utilities to field verify models and model pa rameters for use in WSCC system studies.  The COE has complied with the requirements of WSCC in this area.  However, as new equipment is purchased and installed to replace older equipment, such as governor, excitation systems and power system stabilizers, applicable models to this replacement equipment need to be developed, verified and submitted to WSCC. 3.  WORK REQUIRED	 Scope:  Provide program management, engineering and testing services for tuning and model validation testing on an as required basis.   Program Management Ã¢Â€Â“ Provide necessary specialized personnel or test services, schedule activities as needed to meet deadlines agreed between COE and Contractor.  Coordinate with project staffs for necessary test outages and project support of tests.  HDC will provide technical oversight and will be the point of contact for problems that cannot be resolved with project staffs. Tuning and Model Validation Testing   Prepare detailed field test procedures for tuning and model validation testing of replacement governors, excitation systems and power system stabilizers (PSS).  Test procedures shall provide a detailed step-by-step procedure of all required connections, op erations and measurements to be taken.  These test procedures are for use by Contractor and COE personnel during performance of the tests.   In addition, prepare and submit at least two weeks in advance of all tests a high level schedule, which lists each of the tests to be performed, the operating condition of the unit and the anticipated duration of each test. Provide testing personnel and equipment needed to field test the replacement governors, excitation systems and power system stabilizers.  Field tests shall be performed and settings recommendations shall be made to tune the automatic voltage regulator and PSS.  Model simulation shall be provided to help determine the recommended settings. Tests shall include verification of limiters.  COE will provide powerhouse operators for the tests and electricians to perform modifications to unit controls if needed for  the tests. Contractor may be requested to tune and field test equipment that has been previously given full model validation testing.

<SUBJECT>A -- NIH Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Repository
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities, for a multiple-year contract.  Under contract N01-AI-85355, the NIH Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Repository, ATCC is providing a central source of quality controlled malaria-related reagents and information to the United States and the international malaria research community. The current contract is scheduled to expire on September 29, 2005.  A Market Search was conducted on May 5, 2004 (posted in the FedBizOpps) for potential sources.  Only the incumbent responded.  The proposed contract will permit ATCC to continue providing ongoing support for the immediate needs of the malaria research community.  DMID has determined that ATCC is the only source to satisfy agency requirements to avoid unacceptable delays in providing this support.   There is significant research and development associated with this requirement that involves highly specialized experience and requires handling of material that is potentially infectious/biohazardous in nature. Additional expertise is required to ensure experience and compliance with all U.S. and foreign regulations and requirements for the handling and shipping of biological materials.  ATCC is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance under the current contract.  If this contract were awarded to another contractor, the consequences would mean an interruption and/or inconsistency in the ability to provide these resources to the scientific community.  Therefore, no other service will satisfy the Agency requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Statement of Work for – Assessment of DOC Compliance Program


The Department of Commerce has a requirement to provide the Agreements Compliance unit is seeking proposals for issuing a questionnaire, hosting focus groups, and/or conducting interviews to gather strategic feedback from core and target customers.  These surveys will provide reactions to MAC’s publicly available tools, informational outreach efforts, customer service regarding compliance casework, and new initiatives for exporters.

Background

In 2003, the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey covering all ITA program units.  ITA’s Market Access and Compliance (MAC) program survey report identified gaps between a high level of customer awareness yet low customer use of fair trade and market access services.  Findings also indicate that a substantial customer base is unaware of the specific services that the DOC Compliance Program offers.

In response to the survey findings, MAC is proposing to conduct a survey and/or focus groups to assess, in more specific terms and greater detail, what is MAC’s Trade Compliance Center’s (TCC’s) customers expectations.  This will enable the TCC to answer: “What Do Customers Want from the DOC’s Compliance Program?”   Information about the TCC can be found on its website at www.export.gov/tcc. 


Work Description

The Department of Commerce’s (DOC) International Trade Administration (ITA) has made great strides in monitoring ITA’s customer satisfaction and advancing a strategic approach to delivering value to its customers.  

The purpose of this Work is to obtain customer and potential customer views regarding the DOC Compliance Program to determine:
 
&#61553;	If the TCC offers the right set of services to assist U.S. exporters to overcome foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	If MAC is aware of exporter needs
&#61553;	If the right MAC programs are in place to meet identified needs
&#61553;	If MAC services are properly promoted to maximize efficiency and effectiveness
	
	In order to continue to monitor customer satisfaction and improve the customer experience, this work requires the following deliverables:
	
 

•	Design and administer a MAC survey based on the TCC-relevant recommendations identified during the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey
•	Development of an interview guide and conduct focus groups and/or interviews to obtain additional information regarding the survey findings and address the desired outcomes
•	Analysis and recommendations based on survey and focus group questions that address the following key issues
	
	The primary scope and outcomes from this work include the following:
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what ‘customers’ expect of Commerce compliance services and how expectations match ability of the TCC to deliver those services 
&#61553;	Recommendations on how to improve customer awareness and use of products and services (what tools & how are they used)
 

&#61553;	Identification of opportunities to increase Market Access and Compliance case intake
 

&#61553;	Identification of which monitoring and outreach tools work best and which could be improved or added (best distribution/communication channels)
&#61553;	Identification of data for areas of client demand where product or services are needed but do not exist
 

&#61553;	Analysis of customer perceptions about resolving foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what prevents potential customers from using Commerce Compliance Program services
 

&#61553;	Assessment of how well the Liaison subprogram is delivering value
 

	
	Alternatives 
	
	Market Access and Compliance is considering the two options below and requests a proposal outlining the approach, activities, and timing for executing a survey and/or focus group that will target the following customer segments:
	
 

a.	 Active customers: Existing TCC customers who will be able to comment on the effectiveness of MAC’s current programs, identify repeat business opportunities, and suggest potential improvements
b.	 Prospective customers: Exporters who are aware of the TCC, but currently do not seek assistance and will be able to provide insight regarding what would motivate them to use the TCC’s programs
c.	 Untapped customers: Exporters who are unaware of the TCC’s products and services and will be able to provide insight regarding how the TCC can best increase its customer base through awareness and promotional efforts 
	
	Option 1.  Conduct a Customer Survey and Focus Groups to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall provide an outline of the specific tasks involved in administering a survey and series of focus groups/interviews, including questionnaire development, design, approval, and execution.  The purpose of the survey will be to obtain cross-TCC specific information on the customer’s needs, experience with the TCC, and overall satisfaction.  The focus groups will then use the survey findings to gain a deeper understanding of issues identified.
 

	
	Option 2.  Conduct Focus Groups Only to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall clearly outline the specific tasks involved in administering a series of interactive customer focus groups, including the internal MAC preparation meetings, focus group questions, related facilitation materials.  The purpose of the focus groups will be to gain a better understanding of the issues identified in the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey.  The focus groups will also target the above-listed customer segments.  
	
	Each option shall conclude with a summary and more detailed report of the data and analysis (specify presentation medium), which will outline the primary recommendations for improving the TCC’s compliance program.
	
	Deliverables
	
 

1)	Survey (only for option 1)
2)	Focus Group Questions/Protocol
3)	Focus Group Facilitation Materials

High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive, will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION REPOSTS THE ENTIRE SYNOPSIS DUE TO A POSTING ERROR ON THE INITIAL. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires the services of a financial management and regulatory compliance monitoring organization for the administration of its employee childcare subsidy program. The performance period will be from 10/1/2004 to 9/30/2005 as the base period with four 12-month option periods. The contractor will reimburse incurred costs from an advanced allocation of agency funds which cover the reimbursement cost and associated administrative fee. The contractor will also be responsible for ensuring full compliance with the statutory and Office of Personnel Management regulatory requirements of the program which are listed in their entirety at: http://www.opm.gov/wrkfam/html/cldguide.asp. All proposals must include past performance references supporting the continuous administration of this specific program. The performance data must also show the capability to administer programs similar to the CDC program as follows:The contractor shall perform the following tasks: Perform all required administrative tasks associated with the tuition subsidy program, which shall include the tasks reflected. Submit quarterly invoices which shall reflect the estimated total amount which will be required to fund the CDC/ATSDR child care tuition subsidy program to pay for the services of licensed child care providers who have provided child care services to approved employees. Invoices shall be submitted quarterly to receive advance payment prior to services being provided.Upon receipt of funding, disburse payments to licensed child care providers who have provided services as required.  Insure that those child care providers who will receive Federal funding as the result of the tuition subsidy program are licensed and/or regulated by State and/or local authorities. The contractor shall: Require child care providers to submit a copy of their most current license and/or statement of compliance from their State and/or local authorities. Insure that licensed child care providers understand that if, for whatever reason, the provider is no longer licensed and/or regulated by the State and/or local authorities, the provider shall immediately notify the contractor and shall also notify the Federal employee, whose child is enrolled in the child care program, of this fact. In such cases the child care provider will no longer be permitted to receive the tuition funds. Upon receiving a request from an individual (parent/guardian of a child) who is an employee of CDC/ATSDR, provide child care tuition subsidy application(s). Upon receiving the completed tuition subsidy application, determine eligibility and, if eligible for subsidy, determine the amount of subsidy allowed based on the tuition subsidy model attached. Provide written notification to the applicant and the child care provider of the amount of tuition subsidy and the effective date on which the subsidy will begin. Upon receiving monthly invoices from the child care providers for child care services provided under the tuition subsidy program, verify that services were received (certification by agency employee should be on invoice), and provide payment to the child care provider within thirty calendar days after the invoice and verification that the services were received. The contractor shall ensure that the child care provider submits a written invoice, on a monthly basis and that the child care provider and the agency employee certify, on the invoice, that the care was provided (as reflected on the invoice). Tuition subsidy awards shall be quoted as weekly amounts and the invoices must be prepared using full week amounts unless services end during a particular week. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  Monthly Reports: The contractor shall prepare a monthly report on the status of the agency's tuition subsidy program and provide to the Project Officer by the 15th of each month.  If the 15th falls on a weekend the report shall be due on the following Monday. The monthly report shall contain the following information: The amount of tuition subsidy disbursed during a given month; the total number of children enrolled under the tuition subsidy program; the total number of CDC/ATSDR employees qualifying/receiving the child care tuition subsidy; the total family income for each family receiving the subsidy; the amount of the tuition subsidy being provided to each recipient; State the grade level of the recipient (CDC/ATSDR employee); the number of total applicants for the month; the number of applications in process; the number of new tuition subsidy applications and the number of applicants who were ineligible; and the remaining balance of the agency's funds.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION: The contractor shall maintain and provide the following financial information to be used for employee tax purposes: the name of each employee receiving tuition subsidy during the month specified; the employee's social security number; the amount of tuition subsidy being paid to the employee's child care provider.  The monthly report and the financial information report shall be prepared in TXT formatting and may be provided to the Project Officer electronically as an e-mail attachment. CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION: The contractor shall maintain confidentiality of all information contained in the tuition subsidy applications, and shall ensure that the identities of the applicants is known only by the contractor, the child care provider, the agency Project Officer, and HHS Payroll. The agency anticipates that proposals will reflect a quarterly advance draw of funds but will discuss alternate financial administration approaches if deemed to be in the best interest of the government.  Non-profit organizations with the requisite capabilities are encouraged to propose.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. A written solicitation will not be issued.  Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.
