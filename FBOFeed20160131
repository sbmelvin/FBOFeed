<SUBJECT>Cerulean SM410-CV Smoking Instrument
<SOLNBR>2016-Q-64683
<RESPDATE>021516
<CONTACT>Genesika Carter, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882063, Email fkn7@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price equipment purchase contract to Cerulean Corporation 1470 East Parham Road Richmond, VA 23228. This contract will be for 90 days from time of award.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p>The Cerulean SM410- CV (Cigar) smoking instrument is the only currently commercially available smoking machine designed specifically for smoking cigars which have been used in CORESTA collaborative studies. Whereas competitive 10-port smoking machines are all designed for cigarettes and require conversion kits that are of yet unproven in CORESTA collaborative studies on cigars. The Cerulean SM410-CV has a bespoke software dedicated to smoking cigars that enables the smoking machine to automatically determine the puff volume based on the cigar diameters as per the CORESTA method#64. The Tobacco Volatiles Laboratory has this specific operational platform (Cerulean SM41O\SM450) used across different programs within the laboratory providing the robustness, sensitivity and repeatability needed for the analysis requirements. Changing to another platform can induce differences or bias in the data of ongoing projects impacting possible interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>No other vendor's produce 10 port cigar smoking instrument with the required specifications. In particular, TVB is an A2LA ISO Accredited Laboratory. With that status, smoking instrumentation purchased has to have a GxP Compliance Package. This package demonstrates that the manufacturer has meet the Design, Installation and Operational Qualifications designed to comply with ISO 3308 and with FDA 21 CFR part 11 requirements. The acquisition of instruments which many of our CDC Scientists are trained on with methods developed for is crucial or a key factor to meeting the time constraints for the deliverables of our CDC/FDA Cooperative agreement. Purchasing other smoking instrumentation not only would fail to meet the required specifications but would also require repeating method development activities due to other vendors not having the proper certification for the validity of their instruments.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Cerulean Corporation . Cerulean Corporation is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Genesika Carter via email to fkn7@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2016-Q-64649 in the subject line, no later than 12:00pm Eastern Time, February 15, 2016.</p>

available, it cannot be obtained economically, nor is it possible to draft
adequate specifications or any other adequate, economical description of the
material for a competitive solicitation. The subject item requires Government
source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or
the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support
acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must
submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair:

source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the

<CONTACT>Umetria Thomas, Contracting Officer, Phone 6506043001, Email umetria.y.thomas@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for delivery of a launch-ready spaceflight-qualified 6U CubeSat spacecraft bus and engineering services with options for up to four follow-on flight units. The Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator (PTD) project will demonstrate novel spacecraft technologies (hereafter referred to as the payload), in Low Earth Orbit. The CubeSat will be operated by NASA, in partnership with the spacecraft and technology payload vendors using either a NASA or vendor ground data system. The payload, launch and dispenser will be provided by NASA. Technical support for operations will be required.<br /><br />A NASA goal is to foster the development of the small spacecraft industry and NASA seeks a commercial spacecraft bus that will meet the Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator requirements. The proposed bus design should be mature and require little, or preferably no new development - thus allowing for low cost, rapid early delivery, and reasonably low technical risk. <br /><br />The involvement of NASA in operations will help ensure an adequate level of insight into the functional design of the spacecraft and allow NASA to fully assess its applicability to other missions.
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date of the RFP is February 11, 2016 with an anticipated offer due date of March 28, 2016. Submission dates and instructions will be included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: <br />http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. <br /><br />Prospective offerors may notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>
<p>At this time, the Government is also seeking comments/input from industry on the (1) Draft Statement of Work (see attachment) and (2) proposed subcontracting goals, along with any limitations to subcontracting. Request responses to this inquiry be sent via email only to Umetria.Y.Thomas@nasa.gov, no later than 1:00PM PST on 08 January 2016. Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat software applications. When responding, reference RFP NNA16574335R -PATHFINDER TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR.<br /><br />All contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone questions will not be accepted.<br /><br />Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC.</p>
