The services shall be for a) existing and future research animals/colonies, each with a widely varying colony health status (e.g. mice (congenic, transgenic, etc), rats, rabbits, guinea pigs & hamsters, etc); b) technical services (e.g. administration of special diets, antibody production (Monoclonal, Polclonal, etc), ascites production rederivation services, breeding and weaning services, administration of protocol related drugs and experimental substances, tail snipping, anesthesia support, specialized ocular exams, tissue harvesting, immunoassay, bleedings, inoculations, routine surgeries, euthanasia services, etc); c) quarantine facilities; and d) delivery services. Types/ Quantities of animals include 1) Rabbits (Conventional Housing)  - 3650 cage days/yr; 2) Rats (Conventional Housing) - 7300 cage days /yr.; 3) Rats  - (Microisolator Housing) - 18,250 cage days/yr.; 4) Mice (Conventional Housing) - 9125 cage days/yr; 5) Mice  - (Microisolator Housing) - 75,000 cage days/yr.; 6) Hamsters (Conventional Housing) - 100 cage days/yr; 7) Hamsters (Microisolator Housing) - 100 cage days/yr.; 8 ) Guinea Pigs (Conventional Housing) - 3650 cage days/yr.  Technical Services  estimated at 5200 hrs/yr; and Deliveries/Pick-up estimated at 300 ea/yr.  The performance period is for one year basic period begining o/a 1/1/03, with four one-year options.  Contractor shall be located within thirty (30) minutes for the NIH Campus,Bethesda, MD.  This time factor is required to reach the off-campus contract site from the NIH Bethesda campus.  A maximum transit time of 30 minutes is required to meet the majority of our institute's research/programmatic requirements.  This requirement is necessitated by the Government's need to move fragile embryos, tissues and other biological samples between the contract site and the NIH campus on a routine basis.  The majority of these samples are very susceptible to small environmental and physical changes, as some specimens begin degrading at time of collection.  In both of the above situations, the expeditious transport of the specimen between the contract site and laboratory is mandatory to insure positive and consistent experimental results.  Past experience has demonstrated that transport times in excess of thirty (30) minutes have not provided our research programs with the consistent results required for the Government's research programs.  In addition, in order to complete experiments, some investigators are required to make several trips between their laboratory and the contract site on the same day.  Transport times greator than 30 minutes will not allow these individuals to complete their required experimental manipulations within the required time period.  See numbered notes: 1.  Closing date 10AM local prevailing time on September 10, 2002.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 36; Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) for three (3) Indefinite Quantity Architectural and Engineering (A/E) Services contracts. The following describes the areas and types of work contemplated. All, part, or none of the work may be required at any location within the Southeast Region (Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida) Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 1. Construct Visitor Center -Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, near Savannah, Georgia  Construct a visitor center that will include exhibitry, site work, and exterior interpretive facilities. The proposed site is undeveloped, so utilities, roads, and parking lots will be required. The building will incorporate the unified approach to programming and design for Fish and Wildlife Service Visitor Facilities being developed by National Wildlife Refuge System, Fishery System and Engineering staffs.  Construction of an education/visitor center will allow increased opportunities for education, and recreation to visitors, schools, and organizations. The refuge has an estimated 130,000 visitors annually. The new visitor center will draw people into the refuge by informing them about the auto tour route and hiking trails in a friendly, environmental education facility. This increase in visibility of wildlife and habitat is estimated to double annual visitation, thereby increasing refuge program support. Composed of diverse habitat types ranging from bottomland hardwood forests to freshwater wetlands, the Refuge supports approximately 40,000 waterfowl, and shorebirds, wading birds, alligators, and deer. This new education/visitor center will help define the identity of the Refuge as a key component of the southern tier of the National Wildlife Refuge System, accessible to the public, and a protector of native wildlife species and their habitats.  Professional Services required may include:  Surveying, Geotechnical Engineering investigations and reports, Civil Engineering, Architectural Design, Structural Engineering, Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Engineering, Landscape Architectural Design, Exhibit Design, Value Engineering Study, Cost Estimating, assistance obtaining permits, preparation of construction contract documents (drawings and specifications) and other services as required or typical for building and site development projects. 2. ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge -Rehabilitate Bonny Hall Perimeter Dike, near Charleston, SC  Rehabilitate 12,000 feet of existing, eroded dike for the 450-acre Bonny Hall Impoundment #1 on the Combahee Unit. This impoundment is the largest on the Combahee River and is essential for foraging endangered wood storks, wintering waterfowl and many wading bird species. This outside/river dike has eroded over time due to age, wave action and severe weather. This project would build the dike to 3 feet above high water mark, with 14 feet tops, and 3 to 1 inside slopes. The restoration of this dike is critical to refuge management on the Combahee Unit.  Professional Services required may include Surveying, Geotechnical Engineering  investigations and reports, Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, Value Engineering  Study, Cost Estimating, assistance obtaining permits, preparation of construction contract documents (drawings and specifications) and other services as required or typical for site development projects of this type.  3.

Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge -Eufaula, Alabama, Construct Environmental Learning Center  Construct an environmental learning center and attached Refuge Administration facility that will include offices, environmental education classrooms, exhibitry, site work, and exterior interpretive facilities. The proposed site is undeveloped, so utilities, roads, and parking lots will be required. The building will incorporate the unified approach to programming and design for Fish and Wildlife Service Visitor Facilities being developed by National Wildlife Refuge System, Fishery System and Engineering staffs.  Construction of an environmental learning center will allow increased opportunities for education, and recreation to visitors, schools, and organizations. The site is located on Refuge land adjacent to U .S. Highway 431 overlooking Lake Eufaula. The Lake Eufaula area has been the No.1 outdoor recreation destination in Alabama for 3 consecutive years, attracting approximately 3.5 million visitors annually.

The results of this study will provide the basis for programmatic a nd other acquisition decisions on a number of chemical agent standoff detectors currently in the acquisition process. Testing could well depend on the technology used for detection.  This effort will consider the hardware and software technologies associat ed with current developmental detectors (M21 RSCAAL, JSLSCAD, Artemis, and MCAD).  It will indicate which findings, if any, are specific to these technologies and which, if any, are inherently applicable to problem of standoff chemical agent detection. It will use the JSLSCAD Derivation of Requirements document to provide the operational context and baseline for standoff chemical agent detection requirements.  It will consider both the uncertainties in meeting the requirement as a given and the uncertaintie s inherent in the way the requirement was derived. DTRA believes that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the only organization capable of accomplishing this effort as they are the only source with the resources to successfully provide the measure of expertise, independence, and objectivity and audie nce acceptance necessary to meet DTRA's program requirements.  The NAS frequently acts as an official, yet independent advisor to the federal government in matters of science and technology.  The NAS has the unique ability to assemble committees and boards  of the nation's most eminent scholars who are then able to render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national problems of high priority.  DTRA believes that other contractor's with expertise in this general area would have a potential business interest in providing or participating in acquisition activities construed to lead to a potential or perceived conflict of interest and place their objectivity at risk. See Note 22.  No solicitation exists for this proc urement.  DTRA will entertain any valid responses from industry.  Any questions concerning this contemplated contract award may be addressed to HQ, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, ATTN:  Mr. Edward B. Hale, Jr./ALO, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Fort Belvoir , VA  22060-6201, fax (703) 767-4691.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Iowa State University (ISU)  Department of Statistics & Statistical Laboratory Iowa State UniversityAmes, Iowa 50011-1210  has been identified as a sole source to conduct this research NTE $25,000.00 based on their past and current research advancements in the use of digital geospatial information (e.g., imagery, aerial photographs, maps) in computed-assisted survey data collection.  The proposed work builds upon original research conducted by Dr. Sarah M. Nusser, the ISU principal investigator, during her term at BLS as an ASA/NSF/BLS Research Fellow.  Dr. Nusser?s fellowship research focused on analyzing ways in which field staff perceive and use geospatial information in relation to the task it supports during establishment and household survey data collection.   This project follows up on the fellowship research in that it will investigate techniques for improving digital map navigation which will improve the cost-effectiveness and productivity of field operations.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to examine strategies for improving BLS Economic Assistants? (EAs) abilities to use digital maps and to explore whether training on techniques for improving map use has a long-term impact on the ability of EAs to use digital maps for navigation.  Specifically, an investigation is needed to determine whether map software features linking written and visual route information and GPS-based indicators of current location can be used to improve the abilities of EAs to work with maps.

Planning and navigation is a significant component of work conducted by field staff for any field survey.  BLS has recently made Streets & Trips software available to field staff so that they can plan routes for multiple destinations.  Understanding how to encourage effective and efficient use of geographic materials needed in planning and navigation will provide tools to improve the cost-effectiveness and productivity of field operations.  In addition, there are an increasing number of products that provide map-based services integrated with a global positioning system GPS, and GPS receivers are becoming as ubiquitous as a component of mobile computing devices.

Improving the ability of staff to use maps is important because a vast amount of time is spent by field staff in planning their routes and navigating to their data collection sites.  More effective map use translates to time and cost savings for the survey program, particularly for those who are less likely to use map-based thinking to develop routes and resolve problems that arise in navigation. In addition, GPS is rapidly becoming a cheap and commonplace peripheral on mobile devices of all kinds, and it is of interest to better understand how this tool can be harnessed for BLS field activities.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Dr. Paul P. Biemer, P.O. BOX 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709-2194. Research Triangle Institute, has been selected as a sole source contractor to continue the analysis of response error in the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEIS) NTE $12, 500.00.  For the past two years, Dr. Biemer has collaborated with BLS staff in developing estimation models for use in the CEIS and is the only person who has been identified with both the technical capabilities and a thorough knowledge of the CEIS to conduct this analysis.  Dr. Biemer has spent a number of years exploring response error using latent structure analysis, which has included analyses of the Current Population Survey and the Decennial Census.  Recently, Dr. Biemer completed a preliminary study of the nature and causes of underreporting.  BLS is interested in pursuing this avenue of research and believes Dr. Biemer is best positioned to carry out this work.

Description of Services Needed

Services are needed to continue analysis of the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEIS) and to expand on work completed in a FY01 project that focused on modeling the reporting error in the screening sections of the CEIS.  This work will focus on the use of MLCA models for estimating the value of underreported expenditures by item.  The total estimated cost of these services is $12,500.  The period of service begins upon issuance of a purchase order through August 30, 2003.


II.	Objectives

The objective of this work shall be to continue these investigations of MLCA and underreporting in the CEIS to further enhance our understanding of the error.  However, the major focus of this new phase of the work shall be to investigate the use of Markov models for estimating the value of underreported expenditures by item.  The objectives of this research are the following:

1.	Determine the feasibility of estimating the value of expenditures that are not reported as a result of screener error.

2.	Assess the face validity of the estimates of value so derived.

3.	Given the method is feasible, identify items that, according to the models, substantially underreport the total value of expenditures and the characteristics of individuals that contribute most to the underreporting error.

Services for Research and Consultation related to the Provision of Web-based Statistical Literacy Tools for BLS

Description 

Services are needed to continue ongoing research and design of web-based statistical literacy tools for BLS.  The total cost of these services is $25,000.    This project continues an ongoing research and design initiative at the BLS.    As BLS website usage continues to grow, so do the number of queries related to every-day activities of citizens.  These inquiries might include questions about how changes in the CPI affect retirement benefits, what geographical areas or industries are experiencing growth for job-related planning, etc.  Users with these types of questions are often less-regular users of the BLS website or statistical data more generally and may experience difficulties relating to website navigation (e.g., where is the information I need?), and in interpreting the information when found.

This project is intended to produce mock-ups of web-based statistical literacy tools to support several common inquiry types related to BLS Information. Statistical literacy is broadly defined to include not only aspects of statistical concepts (such as standard deviation) but also issues of quality of data and how it is determined, statistical website navigation, and understanding statistical terminology.  Previous work by this consultant and others (see bibliography, not yet there), has demonstrated that users often experience problems in these areas when accessing BLS data.

The final products of the project are 1) a detailed knowledge of users of particular BLS data and 2) mock-ups of web-based statistical literacy tools that might be incorporated in the BLS website.  These tools might include information maps that point users to information on the topic and subtopics, ontologies coordinated with the maps expressing information perspectives and semantics, textual descriptions of the scenario and relevant data, interactive tools that support user exploration of the underlying metadata, etc.  Particular tools will be dependent on the scenarios and user needs analysis.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), Aviation Applied Technology Directorate intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation for analysis and engineering recommendations to support the in-house development of a  preliminary design IR suppressor for the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.  The Army is conducting an in-house design, fabrication and testing program to develop a reactive engine exhaust infrared (IR) signature control system that will be demonstrated on an UH -60 Blackhawk helicopter. This reactive IR suppressor system will provide improved susceptibility reduction of the helicopter in combat situations while maximizing engine performance characteristics during routine operations. This effort involves airframe/ suppressor engineering analysis and integration support to the Armys reactive IR suppressor preliminary design program.  Sikorsky is the only known source to possess the unique qualifications for fulfilling the proposed contract requirement based on their  sole access to technical design data and specifications of the UH-60 Blackhawk.  Sikorsky is the prime manufacturer of the Blackhawk and is uniquely qualified to provide analysis of suppressor integration issues and aerodynamic assessment of impact to the  helicopter as a function of a suppressor design.  As such, Sikorsky has the superior knowledge and extensive experience in the development of the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to successfully fulfill the proposed contract requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received from all interested U.S. firms only will be reviewed by the Government and given due consideration as required by law.  A solicitation will not be issued.  Alpha contracting procedures will be used to negotiate a non-competitive contract with Sikorsky.  A cost-plus fixed fee contract, with an eighteen (18) month period of performance, is contemplated for this acquisition. Negotiation will be conducted using other than full and open competition p rocedures pursuant to authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1). The applicable North American Industrial classification System (NIACS) code is 336412.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See notes 22 and 26.

The scope of services under this proposed contract involves fan coil replacement for floors 2 through 30 of the building.  Since the building will remain fully occupied by various Federal tenants, it will be the responsibility of the contractor to phase and coordinate all work around these tenants and their normal operations.  The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $10.0 million to $20.0 million, with an anticipated project duration of approximately thirteen (13) months.  Funds are currently available for this acquisition.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Source Selection procedures and the Lowest-Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Proposal process.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is determined to be in its best interest to do so.  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 235110.  It is open to both large and small businesses.  The small business size standard for this work category is $11.5 million.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Millennium Engineering and Integration (MEI) Company, 2231 Crystal Drive, Suite 711, Arlington, Virginia 22202.  The proposed procurement is for nonpersonal services of a highly technical and specialized nature and it can be clearly established that only MEI can perform these services.  MEI has extensive knowledge related to; 1) integration and testing of SM-3 hardware, 2) identification and resolution of hardware, manufacturing, and testing problems, 3) data communications requirements, systems and architectures, 4) computer model design, coding, application and maintenance for link analysis, 5) telemetry test planning and analysis, 6) requirements analysis, requirements verification, and change assessment, and 7) program structure and planning.  MEI's extensive knowledg e is gained from direct, intense involvement in the SM-3 program since the inception (1994) and from the risk reduction Terrier Leap program (1991).  The amount of time required for any other company to gain the necessary knowledge would present an unacceptable delay to the program, which will directly impact the program's ability to sell-off each flight test round, certify and conduct each flight test mission, while incurring greater costs to the program.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Center for Cancer Research(CCR), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Flow Cytometry Unit(FCU) intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Beckman Instruments Incorporated, 8920 Route 108, Columbia, Maryland 21045, for the procurement of a Clinical Flow Cytometer.  The flow cytometer will allow the FCU to (1) provide flow cytometric immunophenotyping service in the diagnostic evaluation of Clinical Center patients for hematopoietic neoplasia; (2) instruct residents and fellows in interpretation of clinical flow cytometric immunophenotypic results; and, (3) plan and conduct research on human and animal diseases.  The flow cytometer will be used for immunophenotyping which is a sensitive technique for analysis of benign and malignant tumors.  It is unique in that it allows simultaneous analysis of multiple complex parameters so that cell size, granularity, viability (including presence of apoptotic cells), cell kinetics, apoptotic markers, DNA content and the presence of multiple intracellular and surface proteins can be determined for each cell in the sample studied.  The data produced is both quantitative and objective, thus reducing bias in diagnostic evaluation.  The high sensitivity of this technique, coupled with the ability to rapidly analyze multiple parameters in large numbers of cells, allows the detection of small sub-populations of neoplastic cells.  This results in minimal residual disease detection that, in some disease processes, surpasses molecular testing (sensitivities of one in ten to the third (1 in 10-3) routinely achieved and one in ten to the sixth (1 in 10-6) achieved with special techniques).  The Flow Cytometry Unit is required in the study and refinement of this technique and its application to diagnosis and measurement of prognostic markers in different systems.  To accomplish the above the Flow Cytometer shall have the following features/specificaitons: five (5) color capability using a single 488nm air-cooled laser and a simple co-linear dual laser setup in lieu of a spatially separated setup (avoiding calibration issues during long runs); a second 633nm HeNe laser for expanded fluorochrome flexibility; shall have Hamatsu far-red sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) for increased sensitivity in the red emission spectrum; shall have no less than twenty(20) bit digital signal processing for logarithmic data transformation providing absolute linearity and accuracy in drift-free signal amplification throughout the PMT dynamic range; shall have an automatic calibration Wizard for instrument set up for no less than five (5) color applications; shall have interchangeable optical filter blocks for increased flexibility in experimental design; shall have no less than a thirty-two(32) tube multi-carousel loader and onboard barricading for positive sample identification; and, shall have real time and listmode off line full inverted matrix compensation.  Shall include an NEC seventeen (17) inch, flat screen monitor and an H/P 2250 color printer.  Shall include a trade-in allowance.  Shall include a one (1) year on-site parts and labor warranty, one (1) week training at the Contractor's facility and on-site applications support during the first year, at no additiaonla cost to the Government.  Beckman Instruments, Inc., is the only known source to the Government that can provide the above requirements with the unique features specified.  However, if any intersted party believes it can meet the above requirments, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capabilty statements must be received in the contracting office no later August 15, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS Code: 334513, business size standard is 500.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insitute(NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch plans to contract with PNG Publications/Amercian Journal of Health Behavior, P.O. Box 4593, Morgantown, WV 36504 for publications services for a special issue of Amerian Journal of Health Behavior Entitled "Youth Tobacco Cessation, as well as provide 5,000 copies to the NCI.  The Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (YTCC) was formed in 1998 to address the knowledge gap concerning strategies that work best for assisting youth and youth adults to quit tobacco.  The YTCC members are representatives from major organizations that fund research, program, and policy initiatives related to controlling youth tobacco use.  In 2001, the YTCC conducted a systematic review of the published youth tobacco cessation literature in order to develop a guide for making decisions to help youth quit smoking.  In order to disseminate the findings and work of YTCC, a special issue on youth tobacco cessation in the American Journal of Health Behavior will include invited papers addressing background and need for YTCC, the best practices process, the findings of evidence review, and research gaps and needs.  The NCI is one of ten(10) organizations that comprise the YTCC.  The NCI, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Legacy Foundation, and the Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative, convened four workshops.  Through these workshops, the best practices model for youth tobacco cessation was presented and discussed; and the evidence review developed and completed.  NCI is interested in youth tobacco cessation because there is a need since tobacco control programs have typically focused on prevention on youth and cessation for adults.  The American Journal of Health Behavior is a copyrighted publication and the only journal known to the government that can provide the above services.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.

<DESC>This solicitation is issued with the simplified procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This solicitation no. NCI-RFQ-20055-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-07. 

The North American Industry Classification code is 541690, and the business size standard is 6 million dollars.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small business.

Background: The Clinical Pharmacology Scientific Core (CPSC), Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute (NCI) has, as its primary research interest, the use of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic methods to develop new anticancer and antiretroviral agents.  Within the CPSC, we are utilizing compartmental and non-compartmental methods to define the therapeutic range for these agents.  Moreover, several of our clinical trials have utilized adaptive control with feedback mechanisms.  Likewise, the CPSC collaborates with numerous intramural and extramural groups by providing pharmacokinetic and analytical support.  Because utilizing these techniques to optimize the development of new anticancer agents requires a team of individuals with specialized skills (i.e., pharmacokinetic modeling techniques, analytical techniques, pharmacodynamic techniques, etc.) success is dependent on a coordinated effort between the disciplines.

The CPSC requires the skills of a pharmacokineticist to participate in the analysis of metabolism and protein binding of CC-5013.  This will require microsome experiments as well as individual isozymes.  This will require a considerable amount of technical knowledge and expertise in assessing pharmacogenetic polymorphisms that may predispose one to increased toxicity or lack of efficacy.  As we are aware, thalidomide undergoes CYP450 2C19 metabolism which is deficient in 2-3% of the Caucasian population.  We are very concerned that CC-5013 will undergo the same degree of metabolism.  This expertise is not currently available elsewhere in the Clinical Center or the Institute.

Background information of CC-5013:  CC-5013 is an analogue of thalidomide which is under development for potential use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and myeloma (MM).  Thalidomide?s pleiotrophoc effects are mediated, at least in part, through its ability to down-regulate the pathogenic overproduction of a pro-inflammatory cytokine called Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF).  In vitro models of anti-TNF secretion have shown that CC-5013 has IC50s of ~100nM (25.9 ng/mL) and ~480nM (103.6 ng/mL) against TNF produced by LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and LPS-stimulated human whole blood respectively.  Thalidomide, by comparison, has a TNF IC 50 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ~194?M (50.2 ?L).  CC-5013 has been evaluated in a series of pre-clinical studies designed to evaluate safety and suitability for use in human volunteers. 

The vendor shall:  1) Develop a model to analyze the metabolism of CC5013; 2)   Validate the model;  3) Identify and characterize the metabolites of this compound that are formed; 4) Utilize ADAPT to NLS fit the data;  5) Organize the data in Excel spreadsheets;  6) Utilize IT2S to develop a population model;  7) Utilize good laboratory safety skills and handle all blood samples with universal precaution;  8) Utilize good laboratory techniques ;  9) Collect, tabulate and organization pharmacokinetic data;  10) Develop, organize, and maintain a patient demographic data base;  11) Quality Control data base for errors;  12) Provide support documents to validate the clinical data base;  13) Assess for drug interactions;  14) Determine whether CC-5013 is metabolized by the liver, and if so, which isozymes;  15) Determine whether there are potential drug interactions if metabolized by the liver.

Requirements:  The vendor must provide the end-user with the results e-mailed within forty-eight hours of receiving the samples.  The contractor will receive the samples from NCI via fedex on dry ice.  (This is important because these samples are for clinical trial analysis in pharmacokinetic dosing.  The vendor must be a Good Laboratory Practices standard laboratory since most of the data will be part of ultimate submissions of New Drug Applications to the FDA.

The technical portion of quotations will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  The technical portion of quotations shall be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria:  1) Previous experience in quantitating pharmacokinetic samples ( 40 %);  2) Capacity to do HPLC with diode array detection aw well as MS (40 %);  3) previous experience in generating QC?s under 10% (10%);  4) Ability to keep solid records and excellent documentation of results (10%); 

In addition to a price quotation, quoters shall provide a written technical quotation with sufficient descriptive literature, materials and other information to demonstrate that they can perform the foregoing requirements.  The technical quotation shall also provide curriculum vitae for all proposed staff documenting experience pertinent to this project. 
	 
Offers are due August 26 at 1:00 p.m. EDT.  Facsimile submission are not authorized.  Offers must be in writing and should be submitted as follows: (1) one original and two copies technical and cost quotations, signed by an individual authorized to bind the organization;  (2) completed Representations and Certifications ?

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-08.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purchase professional acquisition support service for the Center for Information Technology (CIT), NIH from Dennis E. Black, Ph.D., 3 Locust Drive, Thurmont, Maryland 21788.  The specific tasks will be included in the Request for Quote (RFQ).  The service will be for a Base Year with a two (2) year option.  Specifically, CIT requires the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of CIT's unique and complex IT contracted activities who can successfully accomplish the following tasks: (1) prepare draft documents to process acquisitions, (2) gather information and prepare reports on CIT's acquisition responsibilities, (3) conduct studies and analyses in monitoring CIT's contracted programs and projects, (4) review and edit intellectual property transactions to ensure compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and other Federal law, (5) provide instruction and training to CIT program staff in reviewing terms and conditions under license agreements for software and other information products, and (6) perform other acquisition and related business support tasks as required by the Project Officer.

CIT has determined that Dr. Black possesses the unique combination of knowledge, skills, and understanding of CIT's unique and complex IT contracted activities that are necessary to accomplish the specified tasks.  He has provided specialized IT acquisition expertise during the past 24 years to various NIH I/Cs, including CIT, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  He has a total of 31 years experience in Federal acquisitions, of which the past 21 years have been in positions of leadership, management, and supervision that have supported CIT's contracted IT requirements, including the IT systems that CIT develops, administers, and manages for NIH and HHS.  He served as the Contracting Officer on the NIH Computer Center's main-frame acquisitions during the 1970s-1980s.  He served as the Contracting Officer for the multiple-award, HHS-wide telecommunications contracts that served CIT and other components within the Department during the 1970s-1980s.  He served as the Contracting Officer who was responsible for the negotiation and award of a contract to Statistical Abstract Services (SAS) that licensed SAS statistical software capabilities to the entire NIH research community.  Since January 1996, he has served as the manager of an NIH service center that is responsible for providing specialized IT acquisition support to CIT.  Most recently, he has been involved in acquiring technical IT services for various components within CIT.  Since November 1999, he has served as the acquisitions manager responsible for the award and administration of a group of complex IT contracts that support the development of the NIH Business and Research Support System (NBRSS) whose software platform will be managed and operated on CIT's facility - the NIH Computer Center.  Since July 2001, he has served as the Contracting Officer on several complex IT requirements for HHS for which CIT is directly affected, including the HHS Unified Financial Management System and an acquisition mechanism that allows HHS to consolidate its purchases for Oracle software in order to maximize its buying power.  Both projects have a direct impact upon CIT. 

In addition, Dr. Black has participated at NIH and HHS in developing and implementing policy on acquiring highly complex Information Technology (IT) resources under licenses, including licenses for software, electronic journals, and other copyrighted intellectual property.  He has reviewed and edited license agreements for a wide variety of intellectual property transactions.  He has developed and presented training sessions to NIH program and acquisition staffs on reviewing license agreements for the acquisition of software and other intellectual property.  He has developed and implemented innovative approaches to obtain biomedical R&D to bring new flexibility in response to changing complexities in industry, academia, and government from new kinds of partnerships.  He has managed and supervised an acquisitions program involving the processing, award, and administration of a wide variety of acquisitions for highly complex biomedical R&D and non-R&D requirements, and supplies and services.  He has provided leadership in successfully accomplishing several agency re-invention initiatives to streamline the Federal acquisition process; e.g., designation as a "Re-invention Laboratory" and an "Acquisition Service Center".  He has employed a variety of cost-reimbursement and fixed-price acquisition instruments involving complex features such as broad agency announcements, incremental funding, fixed-price options, task-ordering, level-of-effort, and incentives.  He has conducted a number of management reviews and analyses of acquisition support services.  He has conducted reviews of inter and intra-agency agreements, and has processed and maintained registered copyrights and trademarks.

CIT has determined that based upon his previous experience and expertise, Dr. Black will not require orientation to CIT's contracted activities, and is the only source with the unique qualifications who can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NIH.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Allen Scientific Glass Inc., 1752 55th Street, Bolder, CO  80301 to provide a quantity of 500 air sampling flasks.  CMDL operates a global air sampling network to measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C, 18O/16O).  Whole air samples are collected in glass flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  Because these gases are long-lived and well-mixed in the atmosphere, the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small.  This requires that the measurements be extremely accurate and precise, on the order of 0.03% for CO2.  To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision, the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time periods ranging from a few weeks to 1.5 years.  Any changes in the materials or methods used in our measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time series.  Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretation of the data.  The flasks shall be 2.5 liters in size with Glass Expansion, Ltd. (GE) Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  It must be known or demonstrated that the flasks do not alter the trace gases of interest over the time periods specified.  The flasks must meet the following stability requirements over a 2 month storage period:  for CO2 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.07 ppm; CH4 the maximum allowed deviation is 2.0 ppb; CO the maximum allowed deviation is 1 ppb; H2 the maximum allowed deviation is 10 ppb; N2O the maximum allowed deviation is 0.4 ppb; SF6 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.06 ppt; 13C/12C the maximum allowed deviation is 0.01 per mil (parts per thousand); 180/160 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.05 per mil.  Due to the mandated expansion of NOAA's atmospheric carbon observing system, the time required for storing and testing any other flasks is not possible. The extensive tests, done over several months, (after receiving the flasks) to make sure they do not affect the gases of interest and are compatible with our existing 4500 flasks, would cause a gap in the collecting of the air samples.  Existing flasks have already been deployed to start new shipboard sampling programs, and initial delivery of 120 flasks to replenish stock is required by October 31, 2002.   Delivery of the balance of the order shall occur over the next 3 months.  
Because of these requirements, Allen Scientific Glass is uniquely qualified to supply these flasks.  Compatibility of their flasks with current stock is essential to maintain reliability of the measurements of the gases within the mandated time frame for this project and have been proven over time.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government=s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops\#REFERENCE  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be September 3, 2002.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to Pacific Video Products Advanced EO Systems of Orange, CA for Support, Enhancement and System Development of NASA/DFRC's Imaging Capabilities in support of the NITE Hawk Advanced Video Data Acquisition System (AVDAS) pod; Schlieren system; podlet-based systems; digital recording comuter systems, and support development of enhancements to the current imaging capabilities.  These services will be provided through a "call order" type arrangement.  This is a follow-on to an existing contract vehicle.   Objective:  The contractor shall be tasked by NASA to provide technical support and maintenance beyond the scope of maintenance tasks currently performed by NASA avionics maintenance personnel; improvements and enhancements to currently fielded system; development of new imaging capabilities.  Sufficient documentaqtion and inspection shall be provided to assure flight safety and proper function of all pod and camera components, and recording system components.  This may also include the purchase of various imaging hardware to support these efforts.  Sufficient documentation and inspection shall be provided to assure flight safety and proper function of all pod and camera components.  NASA anticipates that task assignments will occur through written direction (call order) from NASA.  However, large or complex task assignments will be detailed in written task assignments with specific deliverables as appropriate.   NASA/DFRC intends to procure this technical and engineering support from Pacific Video Products Advanced EO Systems (PVP) of Orange, CA under the authority of both FAR 6.302 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Justification is based upon PVP's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services.  PVP designed and engineered the existing imaging equipment.  Due to the highly specialized nature of this service and existing systems, PVP is the only source with prior experience that is vital to the successful satisfaction of the requirement.  Award to another contractor would be too costly and delay current and upcoming flight programs/schedules.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR PART 12. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 33431 and 500 employees, respectively. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the above effort in writing to the identified point of contact NLT 4:00PM (PST), 26 AUG 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice, only written communication will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Typically, pop-ups are curved walls. Are you looking for typical curved pop-up or a flat wall? Answer: NIST wants the flat wall. Question: You are asking for the graphics to be printed on the fabric. Do you mean that the graphic should attach to the fabric panels with Velcro? Or do you want the panels to be the graphic? Answer: NIST is looking specifically for an Expand Big Fabric display.  Graphics are printed on to one seamless piece of fabric. The fabric attaches to the exhibit frame with velcro and can stay attached during shipping and storage. Question: You are also asking that the graphic remains attached to the exhibit frame while it is packed. That is not something that can be done. These panels or graphics usually roll up and pack in the case, so you don't have an 8' graphic to ship around. Answer: NIST is not looking for the typical pop up display with 3 graphic (not fabric) panels that roll and fit into cases.

Box 4593, Morgantown, WV 36504 for publications services for a special issue of Amerian Journal of Health Behavior Entitled "Youth Tobacco Cessation, as well as provide 5,000 copies to the NCI.  The Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (YTCC) was formed in 1998 to address the knowledge gap concerning strategies that work best for assisting youth and youth adults to quit tobacco.  The YTCC members are representatives from major organizations that fund research, program, and policy initiatives related to controlling youth tobacco use.  In 2001, the YTCC conducted a systematic review of the published youth tobacco cessation literature in order to develop a guide for making decisions to help youth quit smoking.  In order to disseminate the findings and work of YTCC, a special issue on youth tobacco cessation in the American Journal of Health Behavior will include invited papers addressing background and need for YTCC, the best practices process, the findings of evidence review, and research gaps and needs.  The NCI is one of ten(10) organizations that comprise the YTCC.  The NCI, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Legacy Foundation, and the Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative, convened four workshops.  Through these workshops, the best practices model for youth tobacco cessation was presented and discussed; and the evidence review developed and completed.  NCI is interested in youth tobacco cessation because there is a need since tobacco control programs have typically focused on prevention on youth and cessation for adults.  The American Journal of Health Behavior is a copyrighted publication and the only journal known to the government that can provide the above services.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (Local Washington, D.C. time) on August 16, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects call will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 511199 and the business size standard is 500.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION CHANGES THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FROM 24 MONTHS BASE PERIOD WITH TWO 12 MONTHS OPTION PERIODS, TO 12 MONTHS BASE PERIOD WITH THREE 12 MONTHS OPTION PERIODS, IF EXERCISED.

Please read thoroughly - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) under FAR Part 15 to obtain contractor services (IPIA/DAPIA/SAA Monitoring and Inspection Contractor) to assist the Department in performing monitoring and enforcement of the Federally preemptive manufactured housing program.  This effort includes parallel and concurrent monitoring of the IPIAs, DAPIAs and the 37 participating State Administrative Agencies (SAAs), and issuing and accounting for certification labels and fees.  Through this solicitation, HUD seeks to identify a contractor with the qualifications, commitment, expertise, and experience to provide quality analyses and recommendations for various functions of the Department's manufactured housing regulatory program.

The IPIA monitoring tasks require performance observation of third-party inspection agencies (IPIAs) that perform in-plant inspections of each home under construction and review notification and correction plans.  The DAPIA monitoring tasks require the contractor to assist HUD in tasks required to evaluate the performance of design approval agencies and provide recommendations to HUD on related aspects of the program.  The SAA monitoring tasks are to assist HUD in monitoring and verifying that the 37 SAAs handling manufactured housing related consumer complaints for HUD are performing satisfactorily.

<DESC>This is a modification to an announcement posted in FedBizOps on July 25, 2002.  This is considered to be Amendment 1 to the synopsis/solicitation.  The following are the only items being modified from the previous announcement.  All other requirements remain unchanged.  OPTION REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor will be notified of the Government's intent to exercise the option for the additional maser at the time of delivery of the first maser.  It is the Government's intent to exercise that option within six months of notification.  LINE ITEMS: There are two firm-fixed price line items for this contract.  CLIN 0001 shall include all equipment, delivery, and on-site performance verification.  CLIN 0002 is the Optional Maser and also shall include all equipment, delivery and on-site performance verification.  ACCEPTANCE: Delivery and successful passing of the on-site verification test will constitute final acceptance.  Tests will include frequency stability and environmental sensitivities.  INFORMATION ON HOTPACK MODEL: Information can be obtained from Hotpack, 10940 Dutton Road, Philadelphia, PA 19154-3204/ 1-800-523-3608.  GENERAL CORRECTIONS: The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular through 2001-08.  Specifically, Clause 52.212-3 is updated to reflect most current revision of JULY 2002.  The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions. TECHNICAL EVALUATION REVISIONS: The following minimum specifications and requirements must be met.  Any offeror who does not meet these minimum specifications and requirements will not be considered for further evaluation:
Frequency stability; sigma y (tau = 1 second) (Allan deviation) less than or equal to 2e-13, sigma y (tau = 10 seconds) less than or equal to 5e-14, sigma y (tau = 100 seconds) less than or equal to 1e-14, sigma y (tau = 1000 seconds) less than or equal to 3e-15, sigma y (for tau greater than 1000 seconds and less than 10000 seconds) less than or equal to 3e-15;  long-term frequency stability less than or equal to 2e-16/day (after an extended period of operation); maser shall have cavity auto-tuning (cavity tuning is independent of any other maser); environmental sensitivities shall be (1) less than 1e-14/C for static temperature sensitivity, (2) less than 3e-14/gauss for magnetic field sensitivity, (3) less than 3e-15/kPa for barometric pressure sensitivity, (4) less than 1e-14 for switching to any power source; synthesizer frequency resolution equal to or better than 7e-17; synthesizer frequency control range equal to or larger than 7e-10; output frequencies (greater than 1 V rms into 50 ohms) of 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 100 MHz; operates from 110 VAC, AC power less than or equal to 150 VA, external DC voltage of 22 to 28 VDC, external DC power less than or equal to 100 W; built in battery backup; physical dimensions less than or equal to 107 cm high, 46 cm wide and 76 cm deep. The maser shall fit into, and meet all performance requirements in our existing environmental chambers (Hotpack model 417532). The maser shall have an overall Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5 years.  The maser shall be a standard commercial product with a long history of documented performance.  Offerors who meet the abover requirements will be evaluated based on the following criteria: (1) Past Performance (35 points).  Consideration will be given to the experience an offeror has in building high quality masers, customer satisfaction, maser service/repair, timeliness of performance, and cost control.  A minimum of three references are still required; (2) Reliability - Physics Package (25 points). Consideration will be given to how well the reliability of  the physics package (cavity, storage bulb, loss of vacuum, hydrogen disassociator, etc.) has been.  Consideration will also be given to mean time between failure;  (3) Reliability - Electronics (20 points).  Consideration will be given to how well the reliability of the electronic components of the maser have been and mean time between failure.  Proven reliability is more important than calculated reliability;  (4) Demonstrated Performance beyond minimum requirements (20 points).  Consideration will be given based on the extent to which actual product performance has been documented (not necessarily by the manufacturer), and the extent by which performance exceeds the guaranteed frequency stability specifications and environmental sensitivities.  The manufacturer/offeror should supply as much additional documentation as possible on the parameters such as, the typical values for fractional frequency static temperature sensitivity, dynamic temperature sensitivity, sensitivity to relative humidity, magnetic field sensitivity for a range of field values (i.e., for a 1 gauss change and a 0.1 gauss change), barometric pressure sensitivity, power source sensitivity, and overall Allan deviation from 1 second to 100 days (in a controlled environment); and (5) Price.  Past Performance (Criteria 1) when combined with Technical (Criteria 2-4) are more important than price.  Offerors are required to acknowledge receipt of this Amendment with their proposals.  The due date for proposal submission remains unchanged.

<DESC>This is the Performance Work Statement and Evaluation Criteria for RS-ACR-02-300, ENTITLED:  TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES AND POLICY SUPPORT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1. Background: The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) provides the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with independent reviews of, and advice on, the safety of proposed or existing reactor facilities and the adequacy of proposed safety standards.  The ACRS reviews the power reactor request for license renewal and power uprates; fuel cycle facility license applications; and the safety-related NRC regulation and guidance relating to these facilities.  On its own initiative, the ACRS may conduct reviews of specific generic matters or nuclear facility safety-related items.  The committee also advises the Commission on safety-related policy issues and performs other duties as the Commission may request. 

Upon request from the Department of Energy (DOE), the ACRS reviews and provides reports on U.S. naval reactor designs, and also advises DOE with regard to the hazards of DOE nuclear activities and facilities consistent with the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended.  Upon request, the ACRS is required to provide advice to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board in accordance with Public Law 100-456.  Pursuant to Public Law 95-209, the ACRS prepares a report to Congress annually describing the results of studies on NRC-sponsored reactor safety research.

In performing its activities, the ACRS evaluates such items as the suitability of proposed sites with respect to the effect the proposed plant may have on the public health and safety, and the effect of various features on the safety of the nuclear plants.  Among these features are engineered safety features; plant security provisions and safeguards for protecting special nuclear material; the competence of the design, construction, and operating organizations; the training and qualification of operating personnel; the quality assurance program; operating and emergency plans; and periodic test and inspection programs.  The ACRS advises the Commission on standard reactor design applications and industry initiatives directed at establishing design standards, as well as the test and analysis programs to support certification of those designs.  The ACRS also gives advice to the Commission with regard to the safety of operating facilities, prioritization and resolution of generic safety issues, and implementation of the requirements resulting from their resolution.  The ACRS provides advice and support to the Commission in developing risk-informed regulations.

The Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) was established by the Commission in June 1988 to provide the Commission with independent reviews of, and advice on, nuclear waste facilities, including application to such facilities of 10 CFR Parts 60 and 61 (disposal of high-level radioactive wastes in geologic repositories and land disposal of radioactive waste) and other applicable regulations and legislative mandates such as the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, as amended. The ACNW has recently, at the request of the
Commission, been advising on site decommissioning issues. The ACNW is, like the ACRS, subject to the NRC regulations set forth in 10 CFR Part 7. 

The primary focus of the ACNW's work is currently on waste disposal facilities. In performing its work, the ACNW reviews and reports on those areas of concern referred to it by the Commission and will undertake other studies and activities on its own initiative related to areas of regulatory activity identified by the Commission. 

Both the ACRS and ACNW have a history of recommending innovative and risk-based approaches to regulatory problems. A specific example of this is that the ACRS endorsed the development of an NRC quantitative safety goal policy and developed the first set of
quantitative safety goals for nuclear power plants (NUREG-0739). These safety goals were the basis for the later NRC work on the development of an NRC Safety Goal Policy. A second example is that the ACNW, in the period between 1990 and 1994, reviewed the EPA standards for deep geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste (40 CFR Part 191) and provided its recommendations on critical regulatory issues addressed in the standards. The
National Research Council has arrived at similar positions on many of these issues in its recent report on the technical basis for such standards. The National Research Council study was done in accordance with Section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Both advisory committees have a significant role in the review and resolution of key technical issues associated with regulation of nuclear power plants and the safe disposal of radioactive waste.

The operations of the ACRS and the ACNW are governed by the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The operational practices of both committees are designed to encourage the public, industry, Indian nations, State and local governments, and other Federal agencies to become involved in Committee activities. 

The ACRS/ACNW office is a Commission-level office. The ACRS and the ACNW report directly to the Commission and the members are appointed by the Commission. The functions of appointing, removing, and supervising the ACRS/ACNW staff are, under the Energy Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1980, the responsibility of the Chairman of the ACRS. 

The ACRS and ACNW membership (currently 11 ACRS members and 5 ACNW members)comprises individuals with a wide variety of engineering and scientific expertise. The membership currently includes individuals with expertise in geosciences, radioactive waste
treatment, environmental engineering, nuclear engineering, risk assessment, chemistry, facility operations management, severe accident phenomena, materials science and metallurgy, thermal hydraulic and heat transfer, and mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. Consultants are engaged to provide technical assistance on specific issues when required. ACRS members are appointed for four-year terms and normally serve no more than three terms. ACNW members are appointed for four-year terms and normally serve no more than two terms.

2. Objective: The contractor will provide timely, high quality professional engineering and scientific work to support activities of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACRS/ACNW).  Specific assignments will be made by the ACRS Chairman, the Executive Director ACRS/ACNW, or the Associate Director for Technical Support ACRS/ACNW.

3. Estimate of Effort: The contractor will provide services on a fixed priced fully loaded hourly basis.  It is estimated that the hours of 2,087 for a 12-month period will be provided by contractor personnel on a full time basis.

4.Options and Surge Periods: This performance work statement (PWS) includes in addition to a base 12 month period, two (2) separate 12 month option periods.  However, NRC reserves the right not to exercise any of the option periods.  Travel and the performance of work will sometimes be required outside of the normal NRC business hours.

5. Key Contractor Personnel: The proposed and assigned contractor's personnel under this contract shall be deemed as key contractor personnel and the contractor shall therefore obtain review and approval by the NRC Contracting Officer or the NRC Contracting Officer's Representative prior to assigning or substituting the proposed contractor key personnel.  In the event of temporary (in excess of 15 calendar days) absences (such as but not limited to contractor personnel's time off, illness and vacation leave) the contractor shall as requested by the NRC immediately provide as interim coverage a qualified substitute contractor employee for the period of time during the key contractor employee's absence.  Replacements of key contractor personnel are subject to the ACRS/ACNW Executive Director's approval.    

6. Government Furnished Equipment, Facilities and Service: The NRC will provide the contractor, at the site of ACRS/ACNW office, with government furnished space, work desk, office supplies and the information technology IT equipment (computer equipment, printers, fax machines, copier, telephone), IT services and IT access (e.g., Internet and E-mail) necessary to provide the required services.  The contractor is responsible for providing the equipment and services necessary for work not performed at an NRC office.

<DESC>NA SOURCES SOUGHT: The U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command is conducting a market survey of man-portable, flame/incendiary weapons for use in close combat in urban and complex (mountains, jungle, forest) terrain by dismounted soldiers.  While we  seek to determine what weapons are commercially available today, we are also interested in new or emerging technologies that could potentially increase the capabilities of existing flame/incendiary weapons, or could result in a novel weapon.  The technolo gies (current or future) can relate to new or different methods for payload delivery, the weapon's materiel composition, improvements in the incendiary/flame components, or adding a flame capabity to a weapon that currently does not have one.  The consider ation of any technology is not constrained by current U.S. doctrine, with the exception of violation of current human use policy or treaties. Depending on the results of this survey, there may be a follow-on demonstration (live and/or virtual) of these tec hnologies to key military personnel, but there is no guarantee of such an event.

<SUBJECT>13--120mm Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM)
<SOLNBR>DAAE30-02-R-0323
<RESPDATE>090902
<CONTACT>Michael O'Toole
<DESC>The Office of the Product Manager for Mortar Systems is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for the execution of a 120mm Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM) acquisition program.  An incrementally funded cost plus award or incentive fee contract is planned. This performance-based acquisition will require a system integrator with extensive domain experience in gun fired smart munitions, as well as the capability to develop and execute a Block Upgrade development approach.  General support requirements will encompass Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Production, and Block Upgrade activities.  The PGMM is envisioned to be the Maneuver Commanders organic, extended range, indirect fire, precision munition. The weapon platform for this munition is the US Armys 120mm Battalion Mortar System (nomenclature M120 and M121) and the Interim Armored Vehicle  Mortar Carrier (IAV-MC). The 120mm Battalion Mortar System has been fielded in two configurations: the towed M120 and the carrier mounted M121. The towed M120 is pulled on a carriage behind a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), and also transports mortar ammunition in its cargo bed. The carrier mounted M121 is the same mortar system, but mounted and fired from a tracked vehicle, designated as the M1064/A3 (mortar version of the M113).  The IAV-MC is a new 120mm platform, managed by the Office of the Project Manager for the Brigade Combat Team. Although the weapon system may be different from the M120 or M121, it is required to be compatible (fire the same family of US ammunition). The goal of the acquisition program is to develop, demonstrate, and qualify for production an initial Block 1 capability no later than the end of FY06.  The Blocked tactical configuration must be able to satisfy the following requirements (Threshold requirements at a minimum, with Objective requirements as the Desired goal): Block 1 systems compatibility requirement is to be able to be fired from the M120, M121 or IAV-MC mortar systems and utilize the XM95 Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS); Block 1 maximum range requirement is 7.2km. Block 1 lethality requirement is to incapacitate personnel behind protective cover (earth & timber bunkers, brick over block masonry construction, and stationary Lightly Armored Vehicles). Given the target sizes and signatures, man in the loop terminal guidance (laser designation) is a Block 1 requirement.    Subsequent Block improvements must extend the range of the PGMM to 12km (Threshold) and 15km (Objective). Subsequent Block improvements also add to the target set (incapacitate personnel behind triple brick walls, reinforced concrete, and moving lightly armored vehicles). Additionally, subsequent block improvements must provide the capability to maneuver off of the gun target line defeat targets outside of traditional man-in-the-loop designation Angle T (angle between Forward Observer, target, and gun positions) boundaries.  The Government is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge in this subject matter in the rigorous gun fired environment; experience and the ability, either independently or through responsive outsourcing, to plan and execute system integration/support, technology advancements and component obsolescence; which will achieve a producible design and confront the future operational life cycle of this munition.   Responses must describe the potential offerors capability to design, develop, qualify, and conduct an operational live fire demonstration of a production configuration no later than FY06.  Live firing must demonstrate Block 1 system compatibility, range requirements, and high probability of defeat of each of the above targets. Potential offeror must include ROM pricing for the preceding requirements, to include a ROM per round cost for the final demonstration, which will be a minimum of 10 tactical design rounds. Potential offeror must also describe how the design supports an evolutionary acquisition process to field a baseline design that increases operational effectiveness, and grows through a Block Upgrade program to demonstrate all of the programs requirements by FY12. This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only. This is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. All responses are requested not later than XX August 2002, 1630 Hours (Local Time), to: e-mail pburke@pica.army.mil, US Army PEO Ammunition, PM Mortars, ATTN: SFAE-AMO-CAS-MS, Bldg. 151, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 Attn: Peter Burke.

<SUBJECT>A--SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF A NONMAGNETIC AZIMUTH SENSOR
<SOLNBR>N0017802Q1040
<RESPDATE>091302
<CONTACT>CODE XDS118 (540)653-7478
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), in collaboration with the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), is seeking sources for the design and manufacture of a nonmagnetic azimuth sensor.  Highly accurate azimuth sensor technology is desired for a variety of USMC requirements e.g., USMC fire support teams routinely determine target coordinates from remote locations.  The greatest source of error in these coordinates is azimuth angle.  Magnetic compasses provide a low cost, low power solution, but lack the accuracy required for precision direction of munitions.  Systems, which use GPS to determine azimuth, do not perform when GPS is blocked or when the device is under cover or indoors.  The technology needed is a small, lightweight, low power, low cost gyrocompass that has as a design goal of an azimuth accuracy of at least 7 mils within a settling time  of 3 minutes, and maintains that accuracy for at least 1 hour (tripod mounted) and 15 minutes (hand-held by a trained Marine) before recalibration is necessary.  The device must be able to cue the operator when recalibration is required.  This device will be required to operate at latitudes between the Artic Circles. At the limits of latitude, a reasonable amount of additional settling time is acceptable.  This device will be used with existing and future USMC laser range finders including, but not limited to, the Target Locator Module (TLM) of the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR), Leica Viper II, Mini-Eyesafe Laser Infrared Observation Set (MELIOS), and the MK VII.  The device, plus batteries, cables, etc., must not significantly increase the weight of the above rangefinders.  The device must operate over temperature ranges of -20 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  In terested sources shall submit a white paper summarizing each proposed concept and a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate. The submitted information shall enable technical/requirements personnel to assess the possibility, probability, affordability, and capability of the proposed solution to meet the needs of the Forward Observer and Forward Air Controller communities of the Marine Corps.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED FOR THIS INFORMATION SYSTEM.  All interested parties shall forward the specified documentation on or before 13 September 2002 to Contracting Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: Code XDS118, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100 and reference Sources Sought Announcement Number N00178-02-Q-1040.  The submitted documentation,  upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and shall not contain any restrictive/proprietary information or markings.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the attention of xds11@nswc.navy.mil or via facsimile (540) 653-7088.   NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT BASED ON THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is actively surveying the vendor community to see if a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a General Service Administration (GSA) schedule commercial pricing arrangement is a viable contract vehicle for the Systems Engineering Department (4.1) of NAVAIR to provide contractor support services for the E-6 Block I Modification Program. Presently, the Systems Engineering Department provides support to the E-6 Block I Modification Program through accomplishing various tasks, studies, analysis and reports. The period of performance for each individual BPA will be 12 months with four 12-month options. The total dollar value for each BPA will be $5,000,000, which is $1,000,000 for each year of the BPA.  

Specific tasks that will fall under the BPA will include E-6 Cooling & Electrical Analysis & Alternatives, generate an E-6 Training Visions Plan, developing an E-6 Architecture Plan and Utilization Plan, and creating E-6 Connectivity Architecture Document dealing with baseline systems and networks.  Other support will include creating processes to assist the E-6 program to function more efficient, developing an OPSEC and Program Protection Plan, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Program support, Multilevel Security, Crypto Certification Plan, Weight Savings Analysis, Strategic Planning, and Administrative Support.  Participating in various studies, which include Homeland Defense, Industrial and Technology Base Capabilities, Mission Computer Extension, Multilevel Security, and Wideband Connectivity, is part of the requirement as well.  

NAVAIR is requesting firms who have the potential to provide commercial pricing and have an established GSA schedule to submit a proposal. NAVAIR will use a BPA to place orders against each successful GSA Schedule.  The BPA will allow NAVAIR to cover any necessary tasks required in supporting the E-6 Block I Modification Program through the Systems Engineering Department.  Proposals submitted shall include two volumes: a Technical Volume I, demonstrating the firm?s technical ability, and a Cost volume II that demonstrates the commercial pricing potential and the established GSA Schedule. The Technical Volume I will require the completion of a Statement of Work Matrix, which will be provided to all interested parties.  All parties interested in submitting a proposal regarding this effort shall contact Dawyn Johnson at johnsondm3@navair.navy.mil or telephone (301) 757-8955 or Al Hensler at hensleraw@navair.navy.mil or telephone (301) 757-8952 by 4:00PM on 23 August 2002.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR UPGRADING VIDEO, TELECONFERENCE AND RADIO CENTER'S RADIO CONTROL ROOM
	
I.	BACKGROUND

The mission of The Office of Communications (OC ) is to provide leadership, coordination, expertise, and counsel for the development of consistent and timely communications strategies, products, and services that describe USDA initiatives, programs, and functions, so the widest scope of Americans have information that is helpful in their health and economic well-being.  OC also provides the Secretary and USDA agencies with access to high quality, low cost radio and audio services.  In support of these services the OC Video, Teleconference and Radio  Center's Radio Service has provided farm and consumer programming to radio stations since 1926. USDA's radio service includes news, feature and documentary reporting. The service is particularly important to those many radio stations in rural areas of the country that do not have Washington correspondents. While technology has advanced beyond imagination, the majority of small and minority farmers still rely heavily on the radio as the primary source of information as they work daily in the fields. Radio still reaches an audience of millions each and everyday and most U.S. citizens listen to the radio during some portion of the day, and that includes those in, urban, suburban and rural areas of the country. Also, each year, the Secretary and members of the sub-cabinet also conducts several telephone news conferences with farm broadcasters from USDA Radio's studios on a number of topics.


The current radio facility equipment is at least twenty years old. Replacement parts are no longer available for several of the facility's equipment suites.  In order to provide the most current radio and digital audio services, the facility's equipment must be upgraded and the old equipment removed.  In addition to simply replacing equipment, the VTR center's radio studio and booth will have to be modified to accept the new equipment.


II.  	SCOPE	

The scope of the this Statement of Work is for the contractor to provide equipment to meet the needs outlined and install the equipment, making any modifications to the existing VTR radio studio facilities and equipment necessary to accomplish the installation, so that the VTR radio control room and radio interview room will be able to meet the requirements identified in this statement of work.  For purposes of clarification, the Requirements are broken down into four separate groups: the acquisition of the equipment necessary to upgrade the VTR Radio Control Room; the installation of the equipment in the VTR Radio Control Room, including any modifications to the plant necessary to install the equipment; the acquisition of the equipment to upgrade the VTR Radio Interview Room; and, the installation of the equipment in the VTR Radio Interview Room.

All interested parties please request complete statement of requirements via email at:  shirley.fortune@usda.gov.  If you have questions, please contact Ms. Fortune on (202) 720-1666, or via fax at (202) 720-4529.

<DESC>Sources Sought for LPI/LPD TF/TA Navigation System

The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking sources that currently produce, or have plans to produce, a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) navigation system designed for use on vertical-lift aircraft. This is not a request for a proposal. It is the intent of this office to develop and procure a TF/TA passive navigation system that can be installed in several different USSOCOM aircraft. Anticipated contract award date is July 2003. The development process would be expected to be completed within 48 months after contract award with the first production systems expected 60 months after contract award. Anticipate 150-250 systems will be required, depending on the aircraft selected to receive this system. The system will be required to form and fit into the existing TF radar locations on the MH-47, MH-60, and CV-22 aircraft, with only minor wiring modifications. The system will be required to be installed and interchangeable across the above aircraft without any extensive further modifications. The system must have the capability to provide safe terrain following guidance to avoid both natural and man-made obstacles, allowing flight at different low-level altitudes (100-1000 feet above ground level). The system should have an active terrain sensor, a passive system using digital terrain elevation data (DTED), and a blended mode of guidance (active and passive). The system must be able to take inputs from other sensors (i.e., obstacle avoidance) and correlate sensor data. The active sensor part of the system must utilize techniques, frequencies and/or waveforms that defeat beyond line of sight detectors. The LPI/LPD TF/TA system should be MIL-STD-1553 bus and Ethernet compatible, compatible with existing and planned aircraft displays and avionics, have built-in test capability, possess high reliability (1000 hours MTBF minimum), and have analog and digital video formats. The TF/TA system must be able to operate in adverse weather conditions in all types of terrain and over water. The system must include color weather detection, wind shear, beacon, and ground mapping modes. The TF/TA system must be compatible with aircraft electric systems. The system must meet military standard testing requirements as outlined in MIL-STD 461 and MIL-STD 810. Interested sources should submit written correspondence to the following address: United States Special Operations Command, Technology Applications Contracting Office, Building 401, Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577 Attn: AMSAM-TASO-K, Linda Diedrich. In order to be involved in market research being conducted for this requirement, interested sources must contact the Contracting Office as noted above and provide the following information (Electronic submissions are encouraged): 1) Product brochures and/or technical data describing representative systems with the listed requirements. 2) Current production/development status of TF/TA systems in your company. 3) A listing of current users, if any, operating similar systems and point of contact information. 4) Current status of your facility?s security clearance: Top Secret. Provide CAGE code for verification. 5) A statement as to whether or not your firm would be willing to demonstrate the capabilities of your TF/TA and/or provide a detailed briefing to Government personnel for evaluation at your facility. Please respond by 30 August 2002. For more information, contact Linda Diedrich at (757) 878-5223 x240, by email at: ldiedric@tapo.eustis.army.mil. All responses will be considered provided they meet the requirements of 1-5 above. Based on the responses, the Government may elect to conduct follow-on communications and/or meetings with the interested and responsible sources. An Industry Day may be held to meet with interested sources.

<SUBJECT>--National Park Service (NPS) Vehicle Design Workshop, Invitation to Comment
<DESC>NA This special notice is being issued to advertise the results of a vehicle design working group for public involvement. The Volpe Center is supporting the National Park Service (NPS) as part of the implementation of new Alternative Transportation Systems (buses, trams, trolleys, etc.) in national parks.  The (NPS) held a vehicle design workshop to discuss readily-implementable design concepts for NPS vehicles for the future. The NPS anticipates that it will ultimately procure these modified vehicles using applicable federal procurement procedures. The objectives for these new vehicles include: 1) minimizing any impact on natural and cultural resources; 2) enhancing the visitor experience; and 3) promoting the NPS image through new vehicle design. Concepts for transit vehicles were discussed  according to the following categories in breakout sessions: 1) small buses; 2) medium buses; 3) large buses; and 4) shuttles and trams. Vehicle design and manufacturing industry representatives were invited to participate in the vehicle design workshop that was held March 25-28, 2002. The goal of the vehicle design workshop was to begin the process of defining a realistic and consistent set of design concepts for Park Service vehicles. This advertisement is an invitation for government, private industry, and the public to review and comment on the outcome of the aforementioned workshop. It is in the best interest of the National Parks that section 4 (Breakout Group Objectives) of the Workshop Summary, which can be found at the location noted below, be commented on. This is not a marketing  opportunity, but rather a limited opportunity to become familiar with NPS vehicle design interests and to comment on the workshop summary of vehicle design issues as presented by the NPS. Please be advised that the vehicle design workshop summary is available on a U.S. Government web site for public review and comment, which can be found at: http://www.nps.gov/transportation/alt/vehicle_design/workshop.htm. Send responses and inquiries to: Barry Mickela, Volpe Center, Advanced Vehicle Technologies Division DTS-36, 55 Broadway, Kendall Sq., Cambridge, MA 02142. Mickela@volpe.dot.gov.
