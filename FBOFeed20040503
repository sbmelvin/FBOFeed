<DESC>For technical information contact Jim Howard 530-543-2657. The USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) is initiating an Ecosystem Assessment and Restoration Plan for the Cold Creek Watershed. As part of its mission to restore ecosystem function in the Lake Tahoe Basin the LTBMU will conduct a thorough assessment of physical and ecological processes within the watershed The assessment will include a thorough investigation of watershed conditions prior to the human impacts of the Comstock Mining Era, and provide a detailed account of human impacts that have caused a departure from pre-disturbance condition. Upon completion of the assessment the LTBMU will develop a comprehensive, long-term restoration plan to restore and manage the natural processes that sustain healthy ecosystem function within the watershed. The Forest Service believes the cumulative effects of historical land use are impairing ecosystem processes in the Cold Creek Watershed. The LTBMU is seeking 
SF-254s and SF255s from qualified consultants to provide professional services for a comprehensive ecosystem assessment and long-range restoration plan for the Cold Creek Watershed. 

PROJECT SITE DESCRIPTION:  The Cold Creek Watershed is located in the southeast portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Cold Creek is a tributary to Trout Creek. Its watershed area is 12.8 square miles. Elevation ranges from 6300 feet to 10,884 feet at Freel Peak. The underlying bedrock is granodiorite of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The longitudinal profile of the watershed is stair-stepped, a pattern typical of glaciated headwater basins in the Sierra Nevada. Meadows have formed along low gradient areas. The vegetation is typical of that found in upper montane and subalpine watersheds in the central Sierra Nevada. The project site is located in El Dorado County and may be accessed from US Highway 50 to Pioneer Trail. The Cold Creek crossing on Pioneer Trail is located between High Meadows Trail and Black Bart Avenue. 

THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE ASSESSMENT ARE:  1. Geomorphology and Hydrology - Geologic and Geomorphic History (watershed morphological characteristics created by climate, glaciation, faulting, landslides, fires, etc. that impose physical controls on the geomorphic function of the ecosystem). Time series aerial photo analysis of watershed changes from 1939 to present (including channel dimension and pattern, sediment transport dynamics, reaction of watershed to floods of record, etc.). General watershed hydrology. Description of the fluvial geomorphic system’s dynamic stability
under the current climatic regime, the range of inherent variability in channel dimension, pattern, and profile under the full range of discharges (description of current sediment and nutrient transport dynamics, etc.). Description of the hill slope geomorphic system’s dynamic stability under the current climatic regime (the range of inherent variability in erosion potential and sediment production during climatic events typical for this environment). Determine the influence of groundwater and surface flow on hillslope and stream environment zone (SEZ) function. A focused assessment of meadow sedimentary and hydraulic function at High Meadows (the range of natural variability in channel plan form, stratigraphy, erosion dynamics, and hydrologic connectivity between the channel, water table, and meadow surface under a full range of discharges). An assessment of hydrologic function and connectivity of Star Lake and Star Meadow and tributary stream channels to High Meadow. A description of the history of livestock grazing and its effect on ecosystem processes (a focused assessment of how grazing affected hill slope, meadow, and SEZ geomorphic function). 2. Forest Health -Assessment of forest stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition). Compilation of historic aerial photography, ground photography and historic documentation of forest conditions. Logging history (a spatial and temporal account of logging activities including an assessment of historic logging methodologies and their impacts on tree stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition). Assessment of logging impacts on large wood recruitment to the fluvial system. Assessment of fire fuels conditions (stand density, pathology, mortality). 3. Soils and Vegetation - Compilation of latest available information on watershed soils. Compilation of latest available information on watershed vegetation (including all existing data on rare and sensitive species). A focused assessment on the affect of altered hydrologic processes on meadow and riparian vegetation. A description of the effect of livestock grazing on soils and vegetation. 4. Fire History - Assessment of the pre-human-disturbance fire regime. History of fire as a management tool. Impacts of fire suppression and prevention on ecosystem processes. 5. Wildlife Inventory, Dynamics, and Habitat - Compilation of all existing data (BE/BAs) that will support planning of future restoration projects in the watershed. Assessment of primary wildlife habitat components and functional processes that maintain dynamic equilibrium in species abundance and diversity. Qualitative analysis of terrestrial species communities’ interrelationships with each other and their habitats and how those interrelationships have been affected by human disturbance. Assessment of beaver activity and its influence on the biology and geomorphology in the ecosystem. 6. Human Infrastructure - Transportation (a description of the road system and its effects on ecosystem function). Location of public utilities and how they affect ecosystem function. 
Land ownership. Assessment of urban development within watershed. Assessment of existing restoration projects. Recreation (a thorough account of current and traditional recreation activities and their impacts on ecosystem function). Cultural Interests

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis is seeking a contractor to provide direct organizational and data management support for specific clinical trials programs and to provide support to the CTEP Professional Staff in the acquisition, review and analysis of data and information which result from extramural clinical research and to assist in the development, planning and conduct of scientific studies and clinical trials.  NCI staff may require frequent analyses and reports from the data files maintained at the Contractor's facilities, and frequent, often face to face contact (several times per week) with the Program Manager or designee(s) to discuss technical problems and to review data.  The Contractor will need to access information as often as daily, that is either maintained in various files and libraries of CTEP or provided to the contractor for action at the contractor's site.  
The proposed acquisition is a recompetition of contract N02-CM-97032 awarded to the EMMES Corporation.  An award resulting form this solicitation will be made on the basis of a cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is anticipated that the effort required for this will be 93.1 productive FTEs over a period of seven (7) years ( four (4) years with three (3) years award term incentives) under NAICS Code 541990.  The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on a negotiated competitive basis to an eligible business concern included in one of the following two (2) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as : the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The cascading evaluation preference is to be applied in the following manner: First Tier Competition: This Tier is defined by competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that competitive and price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then the competition for this Tier will stop.  However, the one qualified firm from this Tier will become eligible to compete in the Second Tier Competition, as defined below.  Second Tier Competition: This Tier is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  The solicitation will be available on or about October 29, 2003 with a due date for receipt of proposals of December 16, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through Internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this Solicitation and Amendments, if any.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center – Panama City, Florida intends to award a sole source contract to DY4 Systems, 333 Palladium Dr, Kanta, Ontario K2V 1A6 for the procurement of 8 Graphics Display Controllers with Dual RGB Outputs (SVME-783-052) and 8 Graphics Display Controllers with Single RGB Outputs (SVME-783-053). This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons: The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service life design of 20 years. Currently the U.S. Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC. Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span. The Graphic Display Controllers (GDC) are specifically designed by DY4 Systems and are the only GDCs that are 100% compatible with the existing LCAC SLEP equipment. Use of any other company’s graphics dis play controllers may introduce new, or change existing, parameters that could do more harm than good the the LCAC system. Failure of the LCAC system could result in a loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even loss of Fleet assets. DY4 Systems is the only known source of these GDCs. NAICS Code 334418 applies. FSC 5963. Contract Specialist: Mimi Truman, Code XPS1, NSWC Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001  (850)230-7230, FAX (850) 234-4251

<DESC>Project is located in the Bull Run Watershed, Mt. Hood National Forest.  Access to project area is via Hwy. 26, east of Sandy, Oregon, Lolo Pass Road, north of Zigzag Ranger Station, and Forest road 10.  This work consists of decommissioning 11.6 miles of road in the Bull Run Watershed. Decommissioning involves excavation of culverts, stream channel restoration, decompaction of road surfaces, cross-ditching, outsloping, seeding & mulching exposed soils, and disposing of excavated culverts.  Road decommissioning is to be accomplished by hydraulic track-mounted excavator, crawler-tractor (dozer),  and dump truck.  Equipment will be paid by the hour.  Work is to be directed by the Contracting Officer’s Represenative (COR).  Culvert removal will involve excavation of approximately 5 large (40” diameter or larger) culverts which carry live streams.  Volume of excavation is estimated at 500 – 2000 cubic yards per culvert.  Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality. Approximately ten stream-carrying culverts smaller than 40” will be excavated. Volume of excavation may range from 20 - 500 cubic yards per culvert.   Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality.  All ditch-relief culverts will be removed – approximately 8 per mile for the entire 11.6 miles of road.  Crossdrains will be constructed as directed by COR.  Excavated soil is to be placed on the road surface and contoured (outlsoped) as directed by COR.  Immediately following earthwork, exposed soil is to be seeded with weed-free annual rye grass seed (Lolium multiflorum) and mulched with weed-free annual rye grass straw or wheat straw.  Seed shall be applied at the rate of 50 lb./acre.  Adjacent to live streams, government-furnished native grass seed shall be used.  Areas requiring gov’t.-furnished native seed will be designated by COR. Mulch shall be applied so as to provide cover over 100% of exposed soil and to a depth of approximately two inches.  Contractor shall provide manufacturer certification of species and purity for both seed and mulch.  Seed & mulch is not required on decompacted road surface.  Where necessary, roads may be minimally cleared of brush, downed trees, etc. to facilitate access to work sites.  Road clearing work is incidental to mobilization.  Trees and brush (slash) from excavated slopes will be placed on exposed soil as mulch, and spaced so as to allow for foot travel on roads and to facilitate revegetation (one layer deep). This operation will be paid under equipment time.  Live streams will be diverted from excavated areas to prevent soil from entering waterway.  A site specific water quality control plan must be submitted and approved for each stream diversion prior to start of excavation.  Such plans must include a sketch of stream channel showing how water is to be diverted and a description of equipment to be used.  Required equipment may include piping, sandbags, plastic sheeting, pumps, hoses and filters.  Pumps used for stream diversion must be capable of handling the full flow of diverted stream.  More than one pump may be necessary, as pumping may be needed at both inlet & outlet of excavated channel.  COR will monitor water quality before and during operations.  Work associated with stream diversion and water quality will be paid under Pay Items 1.5 and 1.6.  Diversion of streams flowing through culverts 40” in diameter or larger will be paid under pay item 1.5.  Diversion of streams flowing through culverts smaller than 40” will be paid under pay item 1.6.  Boulder “weirs” are to be constructed in designated stream channels as directed by COR.  
Excavated culverts become property of contractor and will be disposed of off National Forest land.  Loading & hauling of excavated culverts is incidental to mobilization.  Equipment time will not be used for sole purpose of salvaging culverts in an undamaged condition.  Asphalt road surfaces are to be decompacted with excavator or dozer equipped with ripper teeth.  Decompaction shall be to a depth of approximately one foot and cover approximately 75% of road surface. Asphalt surfaces on which soil is placed will also be decompacted.  Channel banks and excavated side-slopes will be “walked in” with tracked equipment or compacted by excavator bucket to reduce erosion.  A 75’ x 25’ x 20’ pile of excavated culverts is to be removed from road 1015030 and disposed of off National Forest land.  Culvert pile is located approx. 1.0 mile from road 10.  Road 1015030 can be used only during dry weather. Payment for this work will be incidental to mobilization.  A 12’ x 14’ x 65’ multi-plate steel culvert is to be excavated and removed from road 1015105, mp 0.7.    All work at this site including dewatering, excavation, seed & mulch, etc. will be paid under item 1.4.  A detailed plan of operation which includes water quality control must be submitted and approved by COR prior to start of work at this site.  As part of contract bid, an overall plan of operations must be submitted which includes: description of each piece of equipment to be used, schedule of work and estimated number of work days for each section of road, and  a general plan for stream diversion and water quality control.  Cost of moving equipment beteween work sites shall be incidental to mobilization.  Track-mounted equipment shall not be “walked” on asphalt surface roads, except those to be decommissioned.  Estimated price range is between $100,000 and $250,000.  Estimated start date is July 1, 2004 with 60 calendar days. Solicitations will be accepted until 4:00 p.m., April 13th, 2004.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate under FAR Part 13 – SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source basis with the State of California Emergency Medical Service Authority (EMSA), 1930 9th Street, Sacramento, California  95814.  The NAICS Code is 541990 with a small business standard of $6 million. This acquisition is to provide professional expertise, intellectual property and management support to prepare the revised document/manual Version IV of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS IV).  The Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) is an emergency management tool for hospitals, incorporating the principles of the incident command system and paralleling the day to day operational roles within hospitals and healthcare facilities. HEICS was developed in 1992 by the State of California Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), to allow for the implementation of an incident command system in hospitals that mirrors the incident command system of emergency responders in the community that they serve.  This serves to enhance communications and leads to development of surge capacity in the event of a natural disaster or bioterrorism event.  EMSA is the only contractor capable of performing this work because EMSA has proprietary rights to the previous versions of HEICS, which are necessary for the IV of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System.  EMSA has been the oversight agency for HEICS since its development and implementation in 1992 and maintained the HEICS to ensure its standardization across the nation.  EMSA has been working with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have HEICS be recognized as the standard for hospital emergency management.    There currently are no other hospital based incident command systems that are organized and widely utilized.  Any other organization that attempts to development this type of database would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, the State of California Emergency Medical Services Authority is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (B) (1).

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to deNovis, Inc. of Lexington, Massachusetts.  The procurement is for a software license, consulting and technical support of their eHD health care administration COTS solution. In December 2002 the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded a competitive contract to IBM to redesign part of the Medicare Fee For Service claims processing system—Common Working File Redesign (CWFR).  IBM proposed an innovative yet untested technology from deNovis.  CMS has a responsibility to exercise due diligence in advance of making a decision to accept deNovis technology as a foundation for Medicare Fee For Service redesign.  For the purposes of testing and validating the deNovis technology and to facilitate independence and guard against potential conflict of interest, CMS will procure deNovis specific products and services outside the confines of the existing CWFR contract.   CMS knows of no other source for this license or these services.

CMS anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract to deNovis, Inc. for a period of performance of twelve (12) months from the date of contract award.

<DESC>The Access Board through the Dept of Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a contract with David Kent Ballast, AIA, Architectural Research Consulting, 2952 S.Spruce Way, Denver CO 80231, to provide consulting services to develop and implement a plan to clarify construction industry tolerances, materials, and measurements.	The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) is an independent federal agency responsible for developing accessibility guidelines for newly-constructed buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act.   Those guidelines include an instruction at ADAAG 3.2 stating that: "All dimensions are subject to conventional building industry tolerances for field conditions."  A tolerance is an acceptable deviation from a specified value and is generally related to a specific material or fabrication.  Upcoming revisions to ADAAG will establish dimensional ranges for most features that will explicitly preclude the application of any tolerance.  Although trade and materials organizations have identified accepted construction tolerances as a by-product of their development of detailed technical specifications for specific products, consumers, code officials, and the construction industry itself have been uncertain about the interface between 'conventional tolerances' and accessibility.  Additionally, industry standards, specifications and test protocols do not yet address some measures of significance to facility usability, such as the smoothness of an accessible route or the planarity of a ramp slope.   And increasingly, traditional measurement protocols based upon straightedges and carpenter's rules are being abandoned in favor of the convenience and detail obtainable using electronic levels and laser surveying and dimensioning.   Soft conversions between metric and US customary units are also seen to have an effect.  Court cases and practitioner queries suggest that a clarification of the tolerances appropriate for various materials and conditions would be useful.  Objective-
The Access Board requires to contract with a knowledgeable specialist in construction industry tolerances to guide and manage a collaboration between the Board and certain construction industry technical and association representatives to 1/develop technical assistance for consumers, design and construction professionals, code officials, and others on appropriate construction tolerances and 2/facilitate the updating/amending of selected standard industry specifications to include measurement and tolerances criteria that reflect access and usability provisions in the Board's guidelines.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Industry associations typically specify tolerances for particular materials and elements based upon project type or purpose; for example, the tolerance range for the flatness of a concrete slab in a building is less than that for an exterior concrete walkway.  Measurement protocols from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) may also be used to set tolerances in construction.  Professional design and engineering membership organizations are closely involved in the process. This industry-based system is well-developed and widely accepted, as recognized in ADAAG 3.2 Dimensional Tolerances.   Accordingly, the Board believes it will be useful to begin this project by convening an industry workshop of technical and specification staff from key design and engineering associations, construction trades, and testing and materials organizations as appropriate.  The workshop will clarify industry consensus on tolerances in construction and will develop an industry-by-industry approach to including accessibility considerations in the standard specifications and protocols that guide industry work.  The Contractor shall consult with the Board to plan, manage, conduct, and report on the workshop and follow up with industries and the Board to implement workshop plans and recommendations.  The Contractor shall also develop a technical assistance bulletin that outlines key issues in tolerances, including metric conversion, units of measure, rounding, significant figures, precision, local practice and legal considerations; the bulletin shall also reference, cite, or otherwise provide information on existing and augmented industry specifications and protocols to readers. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES TASK 1: Planning -The Board will identify 7-10 key provisions from its current, soon-to-be-released, and proposed guidelines that raise tolerances issues.  The Contractor will work with the Access Board and other key stakeholders to identify the contents, schedule, and logistics for the Workshop.  An agenda will be developed and circulated to key persons for review. DELIVERABLE: Approved agenda. TASK 2: Develop and contact list of Workshop participants.  The Contractor will work with the Access Board and other key stakeholders to identify Workshop attendees.  DELIVERABLE: Approved list of participants.  TASK 3: Develop and produce Workshop materials. The Contractor will work with the Access Board and other key stakeholders to develop background, discussion, and resource materials to support the Workshop agenda.  DELIVERABLE: Workshop materials.TASK 4: Conduct the Workshop.  The Contractor will administer and facilitate the Workshop and document the plan, including schedules and responsible persons, for industry actions to develop the revised specifications and protocols that are to be a principal product of this Contract.  It is anticipated that the workshop would be held in the Washington, DC area.  The workshop location must be accessible. DELIVERABLE:  Report on action plans by trade. TASK 5: Support plan implementation. The Contractor will follow up with individual industries, providing input, resources, and support as feasible, advising the Board on progress and issues, and encouraging and monitoring the development of revised specifications and protocols that reflect accessibility criteria.  DELIVERABLE:  Periodic progress reports on industry actions.  TASK 6:  Develop technical assistance bulletin. The Contractor shall draft, circulate for industry and Board review, and finalize an 8-10 page bulletin on construction tolerances in established Board format (see attached requirements for print and electronic accessibility).  The bulletin shall include a general discussion of tolerances and illustrations and references that will enable readers to obtain more specific information on tolerances for specific materials, installations, and assemblies.  DELIVERABLE:  Technical assistance bulletin. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE   The Contractor shall meet with the Contract Officer within 30 days of project award to establish project approach and procedures.   Documentation of the industry plans for developing revised specifications and protocols.  A Proceedings shall be submitted for review and approval within 60 days of the Workshop date.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than May 17, 2004 at 2 PM EDT.  Affirmative responses shall reference RFQ04-055 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source award will be made to David Kent Ballast.

<DESC>The Access Board, through the Dept of Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a contract with Robert Morley, Washington University, St Louis MO, to obtain consulting services to conduct a literature search, develop testing procedures and protocols, establish a network of site testers, implement testing, compile data, and produce a final report on the level of static electricity that is being created in play areas that use plastic play components. Static discharge in play areas is potentially harmful to children with cochlear implants.  The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) is an independent federal agency responsible for developing accessibility guidelines for newly-constructed buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act.  In the fall of 2000 the Board published final guidelines for play areas.  This final rule amends ADAAG by adding a new special application section for play areas that includes scoping and technical provisions for ground level and elevated play components, accessible routes, ramps, transfer systems, ground surfaces, and soft contained play structures.  During the public comment period of the NPRM, a parent of a child with a cochlear implant commented that her child was unable to play in play areas with plastic play equipment.  Static electricity caused by the friction created when a child slides down plastic slides or uses other types of plastic play equipment can apparently cause the cochlear implant to fail and surgery may be required to re-implant a new cochlear device.  According to anecdotal reports, the possibility of a static discharge damaging the implant is too great of a risk, so parents do not allow their children who have been implanted to play in playgrounds all across the country.  The commenter requested that the Board specify a percentage of metal or other conductive material play components be provided in play areas.  Consistent with the rest of ADAAG, the play area guidelines did not specify the materials to be used in play components.  It is estimated that there are now more than 8600 children who have cochlear implants; and an additional 21,000 are expected to be implanted within the next 10 years.  In the fall of 2002, a national forum on static electricity in play areas was held in Chesterfield, MO where there is a large population of children with cochlear implants in the area because of the nearby St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf.  The group heard from parents of children with cochlear implants, audiologists, playground equipment manufacturers, and cochlear implant manufacturers.  The group concluded the forum by developing a list of short and long-term goals.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Office of the Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the existing electric, water and wastewater utility systems located at Elmendorf Air Force Base (AFB), Alaska and the natural gas, water and wastewater utility systems located at Kulis Air National Guard Base (ANGB), Alaska.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firms(s) will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system(s).  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  Elmendorf Air Force Base (AFB) and Seward Recreation Camp, Seward Alaska
Location: Anchorage, AK
Utility systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the systems.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

Elmendorf AFB
a.	Electric:
      Power for Elmendorf AFB is received at 34.5 kV from Municipal Light and Power (ML&P) at the Central Heating and Power Plan (CH/PP).  The distribution system on base is a 12.47 kV, 4-wire system; with 34.5 kV express feeds from the CH/PP to two outlying substations.  The base also has a 12.47 backup tie to ML&P for the new hospital.  The distribution system is made up of approximately 1,868,627 lineal feet of overhead and underground distribution circuits, distribution transformers, switches and street lighting fixtures.  The annual electric energy usage for this facility is roughly 120,411,175 kWH with a peak demand of approximately 20 MW occurring during the winter months.


b.	Potable Water:
     Most water supplied to the Base is supplied by Fort Richardson’s water treatment plant through four metered main feed connections to the Base water distribution system.  The Base water distribution system includes approximately 472,000 feet of distribution main piping that ranges up to 14 inches in diameter.  The pipe materials include cast iron, ductile iron, transite, and high-density polyethylene pipe that were installed from the 1950s to the present.  In addition to the Fort Richardson water supply, onsite wells provide backup water supply and/or sole source water supply to specific facilities.  Two wells, 850 gpm and 337 gpm, are standby wells that can serve facilities or can be connected to the distribution system.  Twelve facilities are each served by a dedicated single water supply well that has capacities ranging between 8 gpm to 85 gpm.  Water use averages about 3.5 million gallons per day.

c.	Sanitary Wastewater:
      Wastewater is collected on-base in a gravity collection system and is discharged to the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) sewer system at two metered locations and is treated by AWWU’s treatment plant.  The sewer collection system includes approximately 375,000 feet of sewer collection mains that range in size up to 20-inch and 733 manholes.  Nine facilities on-base are served by wastewater lift stations that are included in the collection system.  Piping materials include high density polyethylene, asbestos cement, transity, cast iron, ductile iron, and vitrified clay that date from the l950s to the present.  Wastewater flow averages between 3-4 million gallons per day.

Seward Recreation Camp – The Seward Recreation Camp includes 12 cabins, 35 RV/trailer sites, 47 camper/tent spaces, main lodge, and several other camp service buildings that cover the 11.5 acre site.

a.	Electrical:
     Power for Seward Recreation Camp is received from the City of Seward at 12.47 kV near the Main Building.  Primary power is then distributed throughout the site to eight pad mounted single and three phase distribution transformers ranging in size 25 to 112.5 kV.  The distribution circuits consist of approximately 570 feet of underground distribution circuits.  The annual electric energy usage for this facility is roughly 395,820 kWH with a peak demand of approximately 209 kW occurring during the summer months.

b.	Water and Sanitary Wastewater:
     The City of Seward provides wastewater disposal and water supply services to the Seward Recreation Camp.  Much of the water and wastewater systems were replaced in the 1990s.  Sewer lines range in size from 4-inch to 12-inch and water lines range in size from 1-inch to 3-inch.


 
     

Installation:  Kulis Air National Guard Base (ANGB) 
Location: Anchorage, AK
Utility systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the systems.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

Kulis ANGB
a.	Natural Gas:
     The natural gas distribution system at Kulis ANGB receives gas from Enstar through a gate station at 15 psig for distribution throughout the base.  There is no pressure reducing stations in the system.  The system has approximately 6,700 feet of PE pipe.  The pipe sizes range from 4-inches to 5/8-inches in diameter.  Annual consumption is approximately 39 million cubic feet.  The primary use of the gas is for heating purposes.

b.	Water:
     Water is supplied to the Base by the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) through two 16-inch metered main city feeds.  The Base water distribution piping system includes approximately 15,200 feet of mostly newer ductile iron pipe mains that have been installed since 1991.

     c.  Sanitary Wastewater:
      Wastewater is collected on-base in a gravity collection system that discharges to a city-owned main that runs through the facility.  Wastewater treatment is provided by the AWWU.  The Base collection system includes approximately 5,000 feet of 6-inch to 8-inch sewer mains.  The sewer collection system was constructed between the 1950s and 1990s and includes ductile iron, asbestos cement and cost iron pipe.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>CAPS – Consolidated Acquisition of Professional Services (RFI04001CAPS) 03 May 2004 Amendment 01 This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI).  It is not a Sources  Sought Synopsis.  A Source List is not being developed.  Our intention is to  reserve CAPS BPA awards to participants in Small Business programs (NAIC Code--- 541710, which corresponds to prior SIC Code 8731 previously used; Size  Standard ---1,500 Employees).  The both the Draft and Formal Request for  Proposal will be released only through the FBO and PXIS and not sent to  individual potential offerors, including incumbents.  The Notional CAPS  Schedule (Reference Attachment #18) includes the current target dates for  release of the Draft RFP i.e. 01 Nov 2004, and Formal FRP i.e. 01 Feb 2005.  To  submit a Draft RFP and/or Formal RFP, an offeror must monitor the FBO and  register on PXIS; and, insure they comply with the Small Business program  standards established for the Draft and/or formal RFP(s) (Reference Atch #1).   30 April 2004 CAPS – Consolidated Acquisition of Professional Services                      (RFI04001CAPS) The Air Force has a need for technical and acquisition management services.   The CAPS is a follow-on effort to the current Advisory and Assistance Services  (A+AS) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  Several BPAs will be awarded.  More  information on number and type of Small Business awards will be forth coming.   A BPA is a contracting vehicle based upon a contractor’s GSA Schedule against  which Task Orders are issued.  The CAPS period of performance is anticipated to  be 5 years.  Awards are projected for June 2005.  (The terms BPA and contract  will be used interchangeably and mean one or more BPAs or contracts.) 1.  This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to  award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Submitting responses to this RFI is  voluntary.  Participants will not be compensated.  Failure to respond to this  RFI will in no way prejudice or preclude a source from being considered for  eventual award of a BPA in response to the formal Request For Proposal (RFP).  2.  Responses will be considered an initial step in establishing industry  interest and understanding of the CAPS program. 3.  a.  No telephone responses will be accepted.

Potential vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firms listed. Based on market research the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<SOLNBR>FA8617-04-R-6154
<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>Update (5-3-2004) DELETION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE The acquisition strategy for the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program continues  to evolve.  After reviewing the operational needs of AETC, as well as non- developmental technologies that currently exist, ASC/YTA has decided there is  no need for a separate, second ESUP increment dedicated to escape path  clearance.  As a result of this decision, associated funding for this increment  will not be made available.   The T-38C ESUP will now consist of only two increments.  Increment 1 will  remain essentially the same as it was previously, integration of non- developmental ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing.  The former third  increment, upgrade of the aircrew accommodation, will now become Increment 2. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (4-05-04) ANNOUNCEMENT OF FORMAL SOURCES SOUGHT This notification announces the commencement of a formal Sources Sought for the  T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP), Solicitation No. FA8617-04-R-6154.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine whether there are additional  offerors interested in this program and to finalize the Government+s pre- solicitation market research.  As part of this acquisition, the Government  intends to upgrade the current T-38C escape system including the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance.   The Government plans to upgrade a minimum of 199 aircraft, but may upgrade up  to 509 aircraft.  Formal technical performance parameters will be released with  the draft RFP.  Please review previous announcements and attachments for  additional background information (posted below, if using the PIXS website, or  available on the FedBizOpps website).    Offerors who responded to previous Requests for Information (RFIs), dated 06  Mar 2002, 3 Oct 2003, and 9 Jan 2004, or attended either of the two Industry  Days held on 29 Sep 2003 and 9 Mar 2004 need not respond to this notification.   Only unidentified offerors who have not previously responded nor participated  to date should submit a letter of interest to the Government at this time.  The  Government also requests that you respond to the questions posed in the RFIs  dated 3 Oct 2003 and 9 Feb 2004 as part of your submission.  Interested parties  are requested to submit a letter of interest via email or hard copy to the  individual listed below no later than 20 Apr 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  In  addition, the Government requests that the responses to the RFIs be provided  via email or hard copy no later than 5 May 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  This  sources sought notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals and no  contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Important  Reminder:  Again, letters of interest and RFI responses are not required from  those who have previously responded to the RFIs or have attended the Industry  Days.   Please direct any questions regarding your status as an offeror or any other  aspect of this program to the individual listed below.   Discussions with Industry conducted through previous RFIs and Industry Days  have aided the Government in the development of its current acquisition  strategy.  The current strategy is to compete the T-38 ESUP program as a  nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition to the maximum extent practicable,  using a FAR Part 15, Full Trade-Off (FTO), best value, competitive source  selection.  If the acquisition strategy changes or evolves differently,  Industry will be notified accordingly. The Government anticipates posting a draft solicitation within the next 60-90  days for the T-38 ESUP acquisition.  Comments from Industry on the draft  version will be solicited at that time to aid in the preparation and release of  the final request for proposal.  Please monitor the PIXS website and FedBizOpps  (www.fbo.gov) for further updates. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211.  ///END OF UPDATE/// UPDATE (2-26-04) CHANGE OF LOCATION FOR THE MARCH 9TH INDUSTRY DAY Due to the increased interest in this program, we have changed locations to  accommodate all those that wish to attend.  The Industry Day to be held on  March 9, 2004 at 8:30 am EST will now be held at the Irvin J. Nutter Center in  the Berry Room Complex.  Please note that this is the same location as the  previous Industry Day held in September 2003. The date, time, and all other  information for this Industry Day remain unchanged.  Additional information and  directions are available at the following website, http://www.nuttercenter.com.  You can also contact Capt. E. Jay Kilpatrick II,  +edwin.kilpatrick@wpafb.af.mil+, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317, or Mr. James Van Oss  +James.VanOss@wpafb.af.mil+, Contract Specialist, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4192 for more information. ////END OF UPDATE////  UPDATE (02-05-04) NOTIFICATION OF AN INDUSTRY DAY The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center continues to analyze and assess industry capabilities to provide  an upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance. The  Government anticipates conducting another Industry Day on the 9th of March in  Bldg 570, Rm. 102 located on the premises of Wright-Patterson AFB, beginning at  8:30 a.m. (EST).  This will be Industry’s opportunity to meet with Government  representatives and to understand how the Government will measure  anthropometrical values once escape system components are installed in the T- 38C mock forebody located at Wright-Patterson AFB.  This meeting will also  provide Industry and the Government an opportunity to discuss program  developments up to this point.   This is also a call for industry to schedule appointments to see the T-38C mock  forebody in a one-on-one environment with the personnel who will conduct the  anthropometrical analysis of submitted systems.  There will be six half-day  appointments available beginning Wednesday, the 10th and ending Friday the 12th  of March, 2004.  Each half-day session will be scheduled on a first-come, first- serve basis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program will be  given. An open forum of question and answers will follow this portion.   Attendees must indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 13 Feb 04 to  Capt Jay Kilpatrick Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211.  The Government limits attendance to no more than 3  persons per interested party.   How to contact this program: POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Ms Sally Meyer  (PCO), 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.  Jay Kilpatrick II, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317 or to: ASC/YTA, Mrs. Sally Meyer,  Contracting Officer, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433- 7211, Phone 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-10-03) RELEASE OF 29 SEPT 03 INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: 1) List of Attendees 2) 3 Presentations (ASC/YTA; AETC/XPRU; T38ANTHRO_DRZEHNER) 3) List of Questions and Answers  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  the ESUP Industry Day info noted above please email them to  Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil. ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-3-03) MEMORANDUM FOR REGISTRANT FOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM: ASC/YTA  1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201 I Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 SUBJECT: T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program, Request for Information (RFI)  1.

Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS TO NOTIFY PLANHOLDERS THAT AMENDMENT NO. 2 HAS BEEN UPLOADED INTO WWW.FEDTEDS.GOV.  AMENDMENT NO. 2, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, EXTENDS RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS TO TUESDAY, MAY 18, 2004 AT 2:00 PM.  PLEASE VISIT THE SITE FOR THE AMENDMENT.


ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:
The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL - This is not an RFI intended to get information.  The government may or may not issue a solicitation or contract, nor does the government intend to pay for any information in connection with this RFI. PROGRAM NAME: B-1 Capability Based Contract 
DESCRIPTION: The focus of the Capability Based Contract is to provide a rapid response to unprogrammed B-1 manufacturing requirements presently performed organically at Tinker AFB.  The capabilities sought are sheet metal, tubing, machine shop, and wiring.  Capabilities essential to the fulfillment of these requirements are required for new manufactured items.  Export control certification is required to view applicable drawings and specifications.  As this is not a programmed workload, requirements will be recognized and drawings will be provided as needs occur.  The requirements will be met by issuing an Indefinite Delivery / Requirements type contract.  The Government estimates the dollar value to be $2 million per year, which is inclusive of all capabilities.  A sample list of National Stock Numbers is attached.  A Statement of Objective is also attached, which is generic in nature and explains general manufacturing capabilities. This is a new innovative approach to contracting out these capabilities. The Government is looking for industry review and comment to find the best approach.  We prefer a single contract with one contractor with the ability to subcontract to Small Business for capabilities they do not currently possess.

D.	STRATEGY AND CONTEXT

1.	The USAID Yemen Interim Strategy for 2003-2006

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for the educational support component:
Agency Objective: Human Capacity Built through Education and Training
Strategic Objective 297-006:  Improved Basic Education, Especially for Women and Girls
IR 6.1:  Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
IR 6.2:  Increased Literacy and Numeracy Opportunities at the Community Level   
IR 6.3: Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   

2.	Context 

Limited levels of education and literacy are a human capital constraint to economic development in Yemen.  In the rural areas where three-fourths of Yemeni’s live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no formal education at all or have failed to complete primary school. Most (91%) of ever-married rural women are illiterate and most do not compensate by getting information from either radio or television. 

Access:  Education attainment in Yemen is among the lowest in the world.  Although an estimated 2.6 million children are in primary school, about half (approximately 2.5 million) of the primary-school age children (age group between 6 and 11 years old) are not in school.  Gender disparity is pronounced.  In 2001 the Primary Education Net Enrollment Rate (NER) was 61.3% among boys compared to 41.1 % among girls.  According to the 1999 National Poverty Survey, only 45% of rural primary age children (age group between 6 and 11) were currently enrolled in formal schooling, while 71% of urban children were enrolled.  Rural female students are the most disadvantaged (30% enrolled), compared to the urban female students (71% enrolled).   Finally, the retention rate for female students is only 33 percent compared to 68 percent for male students.

Quality: To some extent the poor quality of primary education reflects the low qualification of teachers, especially in rural areas.  The 2000/01 Education Survey estimates that only 40 percent of teaching staff hold secondary school certificates or better, the balance (60% of teachers) have completed only basic education, with one or two years of additional training.  The primary school curriculum and textbooks have been updated recently but the majority of grade 4-6 students have difficulty relating what they have learned in the classroom to what they observe in their environment; explaining and interpreting the meaning of phenomena due to the lack experimentation in school; in mental calculations to resolve problems; and reading and interpreting tables and graphs; and most students have limited reading and writing skills.  Although in-service teacher training is being expanded, primary education still faces serious difficulties, including inadequate school buildings, shortage of teaching and learning materials, and weak community involvement and regional shortages of teachers, especially in rural areas.

Government of Yemen Policy:  

The Government  of Yemen (GOY) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states that  education is a key driver for economic and social development, and sustainable human development.  Basic education is considered essential for rural development and the agricultural sector, and is fundamental to increase industrial productivity.  The teaching of girls is an important factor to improve maternal and infant health and nutrition, as well as to reduce fertility, and to bring about social change in women’s position in society.  Thus, the education strategy in Yemen focuses on four basic principles:  (i) improve the quality of education; (ii) improve the management of the sector and the orientation towards decentralization; (iii) give priority to basic education; and (iv) focus on girls’ education, with the aim of increasing the overall enrollment rate. 

3.	USAID Development Response

The following are illustrative activities in the education sector from the USAID Interim Strategy:
 
IR 6.1	Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
The USAID program will construct, renovate and equip a limited number of elementary schools in partnership with community organizations with special attention to physical constraints to girls’ participation (e.g. separate latrines).   The majority of construction, rehabilitation and equipment will be supported by the USDA 416(b) local currency program.   To improve the quality of education, USAID will also train teachers (especially female teachers) and administrators with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry -based, teaching methods.  USAID will also explore opportunities to provide nutrition and other incentives to increase enrolment and retain children in school through other USDA programs (e.g. Food for Education).

IR 6.2	Increased Literacy and Numeracy  Opportunities at the Community Level 
With large numbers of children out of school (especially girls) and virtually all rural women uneducated and illiterate,  USAID education activities must reach out and provide life-experience-relevant, essential literacy and numeracy opportunities in rural communities.  USAID will increase education outreach to adults (especially women) and out-of-school youth in rural communities; radio/video distance-learning activities; organize parents’ and women’s education circles, community-based organizations and teacher/parent committees. 
 
IR 6.3	Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   
	USAID will develop and implement district and governorate education plans with community participation; fund education planning and program grants; promote new teaching approaches such as interactive and inquiry-based, learning; improve policies and regulations; include life-skills in the curriculum; develop policies and activities for out-of-school youth; provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and to district and governorate education offices to implement the ROYG decentralization objects and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy; provide technical assistance to ROYG at all levels to collect, use and share education data for planning and management; explore IT applications to support program objectives.

<DESC>The Army's Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) is seeking interested parties to accomplish the Privatization of Army Family Housing at Fort Myer Military Community (FMMC), which includes Fort Myer in Arlington, VA and Fort McNair in Washington D C.  The Army is conducting this market survey to determine the type and depth of industry interest in the privatization of Army Family Housing at the Fort Myer Military Community.  Respondents to this announcement are requested to identify their interest i n the FMMC family housing project and to provide a brief opinion on the viability of the proposed project.  The Army seeks the opinion of Respondents in order to gauge the potential for successful privatization of FMMC family housing.   The Army's goal is to eliminate all inadequate Army family housing in the U.S. by 2007 using a combination of: (1) Traditional Military Construction, (2) Basic Allowance for Housing increases, and (3) Privatization.  In 1996, the Military Housing Privatiza tion Initiative Act provided the military Services with the authorities to leverage scarce funds and assets to obtain private sector capital and expertise to operate, manage, maintain, improve and build military housing in the U.S.  The Army's RCI privatiz ation program is a successful component in the delivery of quality residential communities for Soldiers and their families.  RCI is built on partnerships with private sector real property developers, managers and financiers who have the expertise, innovati on, willingness and ability to work collaboratively with the Army to make Army family housing privatization a success.   Typically, the private sector forms a multi-disciplined entity that assumes ownership of the installation's housing assets and takes a leasehold interest in the underlying land.  The private entity becomes responsible for operating, maintaining, developing , redeveloping, and financing the housing community in a manner commensurate with its best private communities.  The revenue is derived from rent paid by the Soldier occupying the housing unit.  The RCI program currently includes 34 installations, grouped into 26 projects, with almost 71,000 housing units -- over 80% of the AFH inventory in the United States.  As of December 31, 2003, the Army had transitioned 10 installations to privatized operations (33,560 homes).  In these projects, the Army will levera ge approximately $201 million in investments from appropriated funds to obtain close to $3.6 billion of private capital to construct and renovate family housing during the initial development periods of these projects.  The initial development periods rang e from 3 - 10 years in which we plan to eliminate all inadequate housing.  Major renovations and construction of new and replacement homes are well underway at the first four RCI installations.  At Forts Carson, Hood, Lewis and Meade, the Army has already constructed over 1,715 new houses and renovated 2,430 more.  By the end of FY 2004, the number of privatized installations will increase to 19 (a total of close to 42,000 homes), and work will continue on another nine installations (an additional 17,000 ho mes).   The FMMC is a garrison command that serves two higher headquarters and that grew out of the Military District of Washington (MDW) in 1993.  It is responsible to the MDW for mission support and accomplishments, and it is responsible to the Northeast Regiona l Office of the Army's new Installation Management Agency (IMA) for fiscal and administrative purposes.  Forts Myer and McNair are historic installations that have performed many functions in their long lives, but for the last half-century they have served  as the Army's Showcase in the National Capital Region.  But while history and pageantry prevail, Forts Myer and McNair also provide administrative, housing, recreational or other support to active duty, reserve component, retired military personnel or DoD  civilian personnel stationed or living i n the region.   Army family housing at Fort McNair includes 29 historic family housing units.  Army family housing at Fort Myer includes 178 family housing units, comprised of 118 non-historic homes and 60 historic homes.  At this time, the disposition of the non-historic  units has not been finalized.  For purposes of determining feasibility, interested parties should assume that the project consists of the 60 historic homes at Fort Myer and the 29 historic homes at Fort McNair. A sources sought site visit is scheduled for all interested parties from 0800 to 1200 hours May 18, 2004.  To facilitate any security delay pre-registration is required, names should be provided to Mrs. Ana Colton by contacting her via phone at 703-696-833 3 or by e-mail at coltona@fmmc.army.mil NLT 1400 hours May 17, 2004.  Additionally, pre-registered parties will meet at the following area: DPWL's Conference Room Bldg 305, Fort Myer at 0800 the day of the visit.  All visitors must bring a valid drivers li cense and or other official form of ID to gain access to the installation.  Van transportation will be provided during the site visit.      Firms with experience in historic preservation, historic tax credits, residential construction, operation, and management are encouraged to recommend means by which this project could be accomplished.   The Army seeks firms whose innovative approach to fin ancing and organizational structure will minimize or eliminate the requirement for Army financial contributions.  Interested concerns are invited to provide their written opinion of the feasibility of privatizing Army family housing at FMMC.  Responses sho uld also include the company name, a brief statement of relevant corporate background (statement of capabilities) as it relates to low-rise (3 story or less) housing development/construction, property management and project financing, point of contact, tel ephone number and email address, to the Contract Specialist via email at tracy.fetchik@usace.army.mil by no later than 15 June 2004.   This announcement constitutes a sources sought / market research synopsis and will close on 15 June 2004.  Information obtained as a result of this announcement is for planning purposes only and may or may not be used for a subsequent solicitation.  It doe s not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal and should not be construed as a commitment by the Army.  The Army intends to treat the identity of Respondents and all opinions received as source selection information and does not int end to notify Respondents of the results of this announcement.

<DESC>Sources Sought --
“Technical Inquiry and Technical Data Maintenance
for NREL’s Alternative Fuels Data Center”

Introduction

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Center for Transportation Technologies and Systems (CTTS) is responsible for providing technical integration and technical data and analysis in support of several activities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) related to accelerating the displacement of petroleum-based fuels through the use of alternative fuels and other advanced vehicle and fuel technologies.   Providing unbiased technical information, tools, and resources is a requirement of several pieces of federal legislation, including the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992. For more than a decade, NREL has had lead responsibility for providing this technical resource, which has taken the form of vehicle and fleet evaluations, data development and analysis, development of on-line tools and resources, and overall integration and management of this base of knowledge in the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC).  Access to the resources of the AFDC is provided via the Internet and through a technical inquiry function linked to DOE’s new Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Information Center.

NREL is seeking organizations with expertise in both inquiry response services and database content development in the field of alternative fuels and advanced vehicles, as well as extensive knowledge of relevant DOE programs.  The major operational tasks associated with this effort include:

·	Assisting NREL in the development and maintenance of database content related to federal and state legislation and incentives, available vehicle and fuel technologies, and other related industry, technology, and application data.
·	Responding to the more complex and specialized technical queries received by the EERE Information Center, by staff at NREL, or by others in the field. 

Both of these tasks require gathering information about, and maintaining knowledge of, alternative fuels and advanced fuel and vehicle technologies, the related industries, and applications through reading and researching, Web searches, electronic newsletters, industry contacts, etc.  For the purposes of this activity, alternative fuels include those established by EPAct, including ethanol, natural gas, propane, electricity, biodiesel, and hydrogen.  Examples of advanced fuel and vehicle technologies to be covered include other fuel blends such as E10 (10% ethanol/90% gasoline) and B2 (2% biodiesel/98% diesel) and other biodiesel blends, light- and heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles, truck idle reduction technologies, fuel efficient vehicles, and other fuel economy measures.

Specialized Technical Inquiry Response
For eleven years, NREL has managed the National Alternative Fuels and Clean Cities Hotline.  NREL has provided technical integration and management, along with electronic infrastructure for inquiry tracking, with subcontracted support for answering and responding to calls.  In 2004, this service will be consolidated with the new EERE Info Center, which will receive the calls and handle “Tier 1” inquires, which are those primarily related to the DOE programs and which can be answered with DOE-produced publications and materials.  NREL has been tasked by the Clean Cities Program to continue to handle the more complex “Tier 2” and “Tier 3” inquiries, which are those requiring more extensive knowledge of the alternative fuels and advanced vehicle industry, or which require more customized research and response.  

To support NREL in this effort, an organization must demonstrate the capability to provide quick-response resources and knowledgeable, experienced staff to process advanced inquiries forwarded to it. The organization being sought shall have the capability to answer questions on all aspects of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles where the representation of fuel neutrality is absolute. The response team members must be capable of answering questions via:
 
1.	Expertise gained by having worked in the alternative fuel and advanced transportation field; 
2.	Monitoring of industry information, development, and technical contacts;
3.	Searches of Web-based alternative fuels and related information;
4.	Close association and historical experience with the Clean Cities Program, and other related programs, through past involvement with the alternative fuels community and Clean Cities coalitions and stakeholders;
5.	Searches of various databases, such as information in NREL's Alternative Fuels Data Center and its database of alternative fuel documents, laws and incentives affecting alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles (AFVs/ATVs); use and understanding of the Vehicle Buyer’s Guide; and 
6.	Knowledge from, and referrals to, known experts in the alternative fuel and advanced technology fields.  

Requests are processed in a quick-response environment through Internet access, and are tracked through a Web-based tracking database.  Requests may require direction to on-line resources, hard-copy mailings (handled by the EERE Info Center), or other forms of information. The organization will be responsible for accurately entering requests for information, including the verification/addition of requester profile information, and detailed descriptions of both the request and the response provided into the designated Web-based request handling system. 

Technical Data Development and Maintenance
As described above, NREL is responsible for developing and maintaining technical data, on-line tools, and other technical resources that enable the implementation of alternative fuels and other advanced vehicle and fuel technologies.  Part of that responsibility requires that a number of databases of information be maintained for industry, fleets, and others searching for information about alternative fuels and related topics. This information must be as current and accurate as possible. NREL is seeking organizational capability, and demonstrated expertise and involvement on alternative fuels and advanced transportation technologies, to maintain the following databases:

·	Laws and Incentives (L&I). It is important to maintain the most accurate and timely information possible with regard to all legislation and incentives at both the state and federal levels that affect decisions to purchase and implement alternative fuels and vehicles, as well as advanced technology vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles. L&I activities will be monitored at the federal and state levels and shall include light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles.  Skills and previous experience in understanding the legislative process on a state-by-state basis and L&I search processing at the federal and state level must be demonstrated.

·	Vehicle and Equipment Information. Detailed and up-to-date information on Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) offerings must be maintained for users evaluating choices, and is used in NREL’s on-line decision-making tool called the Vehicle Buyers Guide. The organization will demonstrate partnerships it has developed with appropriate OEMs such that gathering information on AFV, ATV, and other related offerings, including detailed vehicle specifications and incremental cost information will lead to a continually updated DB of information. Both light-duty vehicle and heavy-duty engine and chassis information will be maintained as part of this effort.

·	Industry Contacts and Referrals. Information in the AFDC is offered generally by fuel type of expertise, such that people looking for contacts and Web sites can find it in an orderly fashion. The organization must demonstrate extensive knowledge of all aspects of the AFV and ATV industry by showing the depth of the relationships that it has developed in these areas.  

·	Web Site Review. Reviewing content on relevant Websites maintained by NREL, so that the sites can be as up to date as possible.  Review of both for internal content, and pointers to related resources may be necessary. Demonstrated breadth of knowledge in the field and the relevant DOE programs will be required to handle this task effectively.

Organizations responding to this Sources Sought request must demonstrate specific capabilities, attributes, and skills, as indicated:

1.	The organization will demonstrate an historical involvement in, and extensive knowledge of, alternative fuels and other advanced fuel and vehicle technologies (as defined in the Introduction to include fuel economy, hybrids, idle reduction, fuel blends and fuel economy knowledge), their application, and related industries.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL), (hereinafter referred to as government) is developing a Doppler wind light detecting and ranging (lidar) system for routine operation on the NOAA Gulfstream-IV (G-IV) aircraft. The lidar system will be side looking (through a cabin window) and will make line of site wind measurements on multiple horizontal planes looking fore and aft.  The measurements will be used to provide clear air wind profiles spanning 10 km above and below the typical flight level of 40,000 feet.  Major components of the lidar will include the laser transmitter, scanner, telescope and Doppler receiver.  It is the government's intent to procure (1) a laser transmitter and (2) Doppler receiver components for the lidar system.  The purpose of this request for information is to determine (i) if there are sources capable of satisfying the government's requirements; (ii) to determine availability of commercial items or, to the extent commercial items suitable to meet government's needs are not available, non-development  items are available that – (A) Meet government's requirements; (B) Could be modified to meet the government's requirements; or (C) Could meet the government's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent; (iii) to determine the extent to which commercial items or non-development items could be incorporated at the component level; and (iv) to determine the practices of firms engaged in producing, distributing, and supporting commercial items, such as terms for warranties, buyer financing, maintenance, and packing and marking.  No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.  Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope, and potential alternative means of meeting the government's requirement is sought. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for these requirement is 334511 and the small business size standard is 750 employees. NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments.  In addition to comments, those interested are requested to provide a budgetary estimate for the System as specified herein.  Interested Sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to this RFI. Any submission of such product literature or "catalog cut sheets" will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals.  NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.  NOAA as noted above is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the requirements that follow.  Written comments shall be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M.  Mountain Daylight Savings Time, May 27, 2004. Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Mr. Daniel R. Gomez, Contracting Officer, DOC, NOAA, MASC, MC3, Acquisition Management Division, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305-3328.  Submittals may be made via E-mail Daniel.R.Gomez@noaa.gov,  Facsimile to (303)497-3163 or express delivery; however, telephone responses are not acceptable. This Notice is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotes.  Laser Transmitter Requirements:  The transmitter shall consist of a pulsed laser with an output wavelength of 355nm.  Due to expected limitations in the receiver design, the pulse repetition frequency will be limited to less than 100 Hz.  To maintain adequate sensitivity, the average power of the laser needs to be at least 10-12W and the laser needs to operate in single longitudinal mode with a frequency fidelity that is pulse transform limited.  The laser transmitter shall have the following characteristics: Operating altitude:  42000 ft; Operating wavelength: 355 nm; Operating mode: pulsed; 20-30 ns pulse length; M2 < 2, TEM00; Average power: 10-12 W; Maximum pulse repetition frequency: 100 Hz; Single longitudinal mode; Single frequency; Bandwidth: pulse transform limited; Seeding lock servo loop bandwidth: up to 500 Hz; Flight qualified laser enclosure; Conductive cooling (must handle heatsink temperature excursions of +/- 2 deg C) and provide interface with an external cooling loop; Maximum 500W heat rejection into cooling loop; Approximate laser head specifications:  Dimensions 26 X 15 X 5 (inches) (L X W X H); Weight < 66 lbs; Approximate laser power supply specifications:  Dimensions 26 X 19 X 20 (inches) (L X W X H), Weight <145 lbs, Air cooled, 500W electrical power requirement; Serial communication control interface TTL trigger output; Computer control of laser functions.  Doppler Receiver Requirements and other information:  The receiver will analyze the backscattered radiation to produce estimates of the Doppler shift of the radiation relative to the transmitter wavelength and the backscattered signal power versus range.  It is anticipated that light backscattered from molecules and aerosols in the atmosphere at 355 nm wavelength will be gathered by a telescope and focused into a multi-mode optical fiber, which will direct the light into the frequency analysis element. The Doppler  receiver shall include this fiber.  For consideration in the Doppler receiver design, the anticipated characteristics of the other lidar componentss are as follows:  Operating wavelength:  355 nm; Maximum pulse repetition frequency: 100 Hz; Laser power:  10 watts; Output path transmission:  90%; Scanner and telescope:  Holographic Optical Element (HOE); HOE free aperture diameter:  30 cm; HOE efficiency: 0.5 ; Field of view: 2 mrad.  The Doppler receiver shall have the following characteristics:  Operating altitude:  42,000 ft; Averaging time:  Two seconds; Range Resolution:  1 km; Measurement precision:  Better than 1 m s-1 to ranges of 15 km at  42000 ft altitude for a pure molecular scatter atmosphere; No loss in precision for aerosol/molecular scattering ratios above 1.0; Measurement bias:  less than 1 m s-1; Range of Doppler shifts:  The system shall be capable of measuring Doppler shifts equivalent to radial velocity component ranging from +350 m s-1 to -350 m s-1, in order to include the combined effects of wind speed and aircraft motion;
Minimum range: 250 m; Ability to receive and process pulsed backscattered radiation at up to 100 Hz rate; Ability to average multiple pulses and produce estimates of Doppler velocity; User shall be able to specify and change averaging time, minimum averaging time = 1 s, maximum averaging time = 90 s. The receiver design shall include a capability to measure and compensate for pulse to pulse variability and drift of the laser pulse frequency when computing Doppler winds.  This variability shall be recorded for analysis of laser characteristics.  The receiver shall operate on the NOAA G-IV Aircraft.  Size, weight, and power limitations are particularly important for aircraft operation.  On the NOAA G-IV, the following specifications are anticipated: Ability to maintain stability with accelerations of +/-  3 g; Operating temperature range: 20-40C; Storage temperature range: -20 - 60C; Size:  Receiver enclosure:  No larger than 10 X 15 X 34 inches (L X W X H); Electronic rack : 26 X 19 X 43 (L X W X H); Weight: 
Receiver Enclosure: 70 lb; Electronics rack : 45 lb; Electrical power : <100 W; Cooling:  A port has been reserved on the aircraft for installation of a radiator to dump excess heat to the atmosphere.  The receiver cooling loop shall be capable of interfacing with, and providing cooling for the transmitter laser (500 watts) in addition to any cooling requirements of the receiver; Orientation and mounting:  The receiver shall be capable of operating at any orientation
Aircraft certification:  The receiver shall be certified safe for aircraft operation.  Interface and control:  The receiver shall provide to the system control computer records comprising measured Doppler shift, calibrated backscattered power, and quality factor versus range.  Records shall also include measurement time (UTC).  The receiver shallould also archive any raw and intermediate level data necessary to enable post-flight troubleshooting and quality control.  The receiver shall be designed to enable adjustment of major operating characteristics in real time through communication with the system control computer.

MARKET SURVEY AND TRADE STUDY
-
Jacobs Sverdrup is conducting a market survey and trade study in conjunction with delivery order TO703BGF1441 awarded by the General Services Administration.  This announcement constitutes a request for information (RFI) to support the market survey and trade study.  Information contained in this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The Government is currently conducting a market survey and trade study of software architecture and integration products and services that can provide a robust, flexible, scalable service-oriented architecture for Air Force Graduate Flying Training (GFT) based on open standards.  The architecture would be implemented incrementally, adapting existing systems to the architecture, removing intersystem dependencies, and eventually attaining true plug and play compatibility of components.  A questionnaire soliciting information about specific software architecture and integration products and services will be provided for interested vendors to complete.  Analysis of the questionnaire responses will include consideration of standards used, employment of data-centric and/or distributed-process architectures, use of data marts, data warehouses, message routers, adapters, and agents, and incorporation of business objects, firewalls, and security mechanisms.

The GFT Training Management System (TMS) will apply technology to control the staggering amount of administrative and execution data generated by GFT operations.  Understanding and using this information by leadership is necessary for efficient resource planning decisions at all organizational levels.  

The TMS will need to integrate a number of existing and future components to achieve its purpose.  

This announcement only concerns products and services that may be used to accomplish this integration and does not concern TMS applications that may be integrated into the service oriented architecture.

No paper copies of information in this announcement will be provided.  Businesses currently offering the same or similar services are requested to respond via email within 
25 days after the posting date of this notice to pat.lawlis@jacobs.com (alternate POC is terry.courtheyn@jacobs.com).  Potential Vendors may also email comments or questions to the same contact.

<DESC>M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mines; M18A1E1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mines, which is a variant that uses a non-electrical initiation system (M18A1E1); and its trainer (M68E1).  The solicitation (when written), will be written to include multiple years (i.e. basic contract with 4 options) and will utilize range pricing and Best Value criteria.  The composition C4 explosive for the munition and the M7 Antipersonnel Mine Bandoleer will be GFM.   The current M18A1 (NSN 1345-00-710-6946, DODAC 1345-K143, P/N 8835166) consists of the M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104) and an electrical initiation system all packed for field use in an M7 Bandoleer. The electrical initiation system of the M 18A1 consists of an M4 electrical blasting cap with integral 100 foot wire extension (P/N 8836013), M57 Firing Device (P/N 8800924), and M40 Electrical Test Set (P/N 8800950).  The M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104) consists of a molded plastic  case approximately 22 cm wide, 14 cm high, and 6 cm thick that is formed to a slight arc along its vertical axis. The case is lined with a single layer of 700 steel balls in a resin matrix along the inside of the convex side. The remainder of the case is filled with approximately 0.75 kg of Composition C4 high explosive. Two folding, scissor-type steel legs are affixed to the bottom edge. Molded along the top edge are an aiming site and two cap wells that accept plastic combination shipping plug/blasting c ap holders.  The M4 electrical blasting cap with integral 100 foot wire extension (P/N 8836013) is a 100 foot length of two-conductor Type II AWG 18 wire with an integrated M4 electrical blasting cap connected at one end and a rubber-coated, two prong fema le connector (with shorting shipping plug) connected to the other. The electrical blasting cap mates with the combination shipping plug/blasting cap holder on the Weapon Body. Only one M4 is required to detonate the mine and may be inserted into either cap  well. For shipping and storage, the 100 foot length of wire is wound around a hollow plastic spool with the blasting cap stored in the hollow hub.  The M57 firing device (P/N 8800924) is a hand operated reusable detonator that generates electrical impulse s sufficient to detonate the blasting cap. The M57 includes a spring loaded lever that couples the users gripping action to an armature assembly which, in turn, generates an electrical impulse of at least 15.3 milliwatt-seconds over a time period of less t han 24 milliseconds. The M57 also includes a rubber-coated, two prong male connector (with shipping plug) that mates with and transmits the electrical impulse to the M4s female connector.  The M40 Electrical Test Set (P/N 8800950) provides the user with a means to perform an electrical check of both the M57 and M4. The M40 is a sheet metal case with approximate dimensions 4 x 4 x 9 cm. It includes rubber-coated, two-prong, male and female connectors (with shipping plugs) that mate with the M4 and M57 and an  indicator lamp.  The M18A1E1 (NSN TBD, DODAC 1345-TBD, P/N TBD) will be identical to the current M18A1 antipersonnel mine except expect the M18A1E1 will utilize a non-electric (shock-tube based) initiation system instead of the electrical initiation used in the M18A1. The M18A1E1 will include the M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104 as described above and shock-tube based initiation system all packed for field use in an M7 Bandoleer.  The initiation system of the M18A1E1 will be similar to the M21 (NSN 1375-01-494-6945) which has been qualified under the Modernized Demolition Initiator (MDI) program. The M21 is a completely integrated system. It consists of a factory connected igniter a t one end of a 500 foot length of shock tube (a plastic tube with its inside wall coated with mixture of HMX and aluminum power), and factory sealed non-electric blasting cap at the other end. The igniter initiates the explosive mixture. The resulting shoc k propagates throug h the tube to activate the blasting cap at the other end. The M18A1E1 initiation system will be identical to the M21 except it will use a shock tube of different length (100 feet) and nominal diameter (0.105 inches). This configuration (P/N 13006677) is cu rrently undergoing certification.   The M7 Antipersonnel Mine Bandoleer will still be utilized in the M18A1E1. However the instruction set attached to the Bandoleer will be updated to reflect the procedure for non-electric initiation. The TDP for the current M18A1 will be used once it is updated to cleanse obsolete and replaced specifications (Top Level Drawing D8837104). However the top level drawing (D8835166) will be updated to reflect the new configuration of the M18A1E1. Drawings t hat refer to the M4 (D8836013), the M57 (D8800924), and the M40 (D8800950) will be removed and replaced by drawing of the non-electric initiation system for the M18A1E1 TDP. The M68E1 Antipersonnel Practice Mine will be an inert version of M18A1E1 for training uses. It will be similar to the current M68 (NSN 1345-00-402-402-2226, DODAC 1345-K139, P/N TBD) which is the M18A1 trainer. The M68E1 will be identical to the M68 excep t for its simulated initiation system. Whereas the M68 includes inert components to simulate the electrical initiation system of the M18A1, the M68E1 will include inert components to simulate the M18A1E1 non-electric initiation system.   The M68E1 will include the M33 Anti Personnel Practice Mine (P/N 9251501) whose physical configuration is identical to the M18A1 Anti Personnel Weapon Body (P/N 8837104) except it is blue, has inert markings, and contains no explosive material. The M68E1 will use an inert initiation system similar to the M22 (NSN 1375-01-494-6934, DODAC 1375-MN89) which has been qualified under the Modernized Demolition Initiator (MDI) program except the length of shock tube will be 100 feet instead of 500. The M7 Antipersonnel Mine Bandoleer will still be utilized in the M68E1. However the instruction set attached to the Bandoleer will be updated to reflect the procedure for non-electric initiation. Interested companies should respond by providing the government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, Business size, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above cr  iteria) and availability, i.e., estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities. A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the explosives processing industry . A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respo n dent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: US Army Field Support Command, ATTN: AMSFS-CCM-A, Stephanie Krogman, 1 Rock Island, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000. This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall no t be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the government. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government will utilize the in format ion provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.

<SUBJECT>D -- Custom Computer Programming FLAMES
<DESC>The Air Force Special Operations Command intends to award a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Ternion Corporation, 3325 Triana Boulevard, Huntsville, Alabama 35805-5146.  The Government’s requirement is to develop a Command and Control Weapons System Part Task Trainer (C2WSPTT) to provide a low-cost, on-demand, in-garrison modeling and simulation (M&S) capability to stimulate an Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) environment.  A key component to C2WSPTT’s success is the use of Force Level Analysis and Mission Effectiveness System (FLAMES) as the M&S development platform.  FLAMES provides a single architecture for constructing air, space, land, sea, human, and environmental models.  FLAMES ability to construct models in all domains makes it possible to reduce the hardware and manpower requirements to a single system operated by a single controller.  As all models reside on the same platform, only one database is required and interactive control of the scenario is accomplished through one interface.  There is no need for a distributed protocol to share data among disparate systems that requires expensive bandwidth.  A phased planning approach will be used to execute the C2WSPTT development strategy. This is an ongoing project to assist with analysis, design, development, test, implementation, and documentation of new software upgrades or capabilities to the C2WSPTT System using the FLAMES development platform.  Tasks shall include, but are not limited to, software development, maintenance, providing technical expertise in assessing requirements and feasibility for software design, and providing software documentation to support any AWFC and 505th Command and Control Wing (CCW) mission using the C2WSPTT software.  Ternion shall also provide annual software maintenance for the 505th Communications Squadron existing software licenses.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All prospective sources should e-mail Michael Wenrick at Michael.Wenrick@hurlburt.af.mil to submit your interest and capability data.  Required performance shall begin on 01 July 2004. All products designated under this award shall be delivered to the 505th Communications Squadron (505th CS) Hurlburt Field, Florida.

Title:	Controlled Vesicle Self-Assembly in Continuous Two Phase Flow Microfluidic Channels

Description:  The spontaneous self-assembly of phospholipids into liposomes in aqueous solution results in the encapsulation of reagents into quantized packets in a manner that mimics cellular life-processes.  Traditional liposome preparation methods are conducted through mixing of bulk phases, leading to inhomogeneous chemical and/or mechanical conditions during liposome formation; hence liposomes are often polydisperse in size and lamellarity.  The formation of liposomes that encapsulate reagents in a continuous 2-phase flow planar microfluidic network with precision control of size, over the range of 100 nm to 300 nm, by manipulation of liquid flow rates is shown.  Creating a solvent-aqueous interfacial region in a microfluidic format that is homogenous and controllable on the length scale of a liposome demonstrates the facilitation of fine control of liposome size and polydispersity. ***

Title:  Superconformat Metal Deposition Using Derivitized Substrates

Description:  A two-step process for depositing seam-free and void-free metal metallization for use as conductors in microelectronics has been developed.  Superconformal metal deposition in features, e.g., damascene process for filling trenches and vias on a patterned wafer, is achieved in an electrolyte that does not contain a deposition-rate increasing catalyst.  The superfill process is accomplished by first adsorbing the catalyst onto the surface of the specimen by immersion in a catalyst-containing solution.  After controlled adsorption of a submonolayer coverage of catalyst, metal deposition is then accomplished in a catalyst-free electrolyte that may contain metal deposition-rate inhibiting additives and/or levelers. ***

<DESC>Amendment 4, issued on 5/03/2004, provides the following question received in response to the RFP, and the Government's response.  The Government's response is provided for informational purposes only and does not signify any chnage to the requirements.  any changes to the requirements will be specifically stated separately.

Question 1:  There are some clauses within FAR 52.212-4 that our firm cannot agree to; specifically patent indemnifications referenced in "(h)".  This is not something that our firm indemnifies for as part of its course of business.

Answerr 1:  As the certification states under (h) Patent indemnity:  "The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings."  This requirement is part of the commercial items certifications and is consistent with customary commercial practices.  The Government does not intend to waive its rights in this regard, and therefore this requirement will remain unchanged.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR VACUUM BOX FOR THE NEXT GENERATION LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date for proposals to 4:30 pm CDT on May 10, 2004 and to answer a question posed by an interested party. QUESTION 1, AMENDMENT 3.  Is it the intent of the government to require this door seal to be cryogenic as the solicitation implies. The cost difference for this seal is significant and our submitted quote included a metal seal. If the door seal can be elastomeric our bid will be artificially high. What to we do? ANSWER.  The door seal is not required to function when exposed to cryogenic temperatures, since this will be the result of failure conditions where cryogenic leakage occurs inside the box.	However, some of the flange seals are required to function at cryogenic temperatures, since cryogenic fluids will pass through the feed-throughs. The due date for receipt of offers is  extended to May 10, 2004. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 12, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
