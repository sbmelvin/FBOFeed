REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED. Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on:  (a) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (b) your organization's experience and (c) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products.  (2) a TECHNICAL PROPOSAL indicating proposed methods and procedures to be used in handling referrals; actions to be accomplished to ensure that all completeness and confidentiality requirements are satisfied regarding employee records and disclosures; a description of frequency and content for employee and management training sessions and informational seminars; an outline of proposed process flow from employee/manager through to outside community resources.

The Government objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a
firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Public Technology, Inc. (PTI). This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geographic Information Office.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government has a requirement for development of geospatial national standards in support of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in their work on the electronic government initiative Geospatial One-Stop.  Task one of the Geospatial One-Stop includes the development of national standards that are relevant to the nation.  The FGDC must fully engage all sectors of the Geospatial community under this task.  Local government is a key sector that needs to be fully engaged in the Geospatial One-Stop in general and the standards development activities in particular.  It is estimated that two thirds of the geospatial data collection in the United States is done at the local level.  The need is for local government to use national standards,  therefore it is critical that leading county and city organizations be engaged as full participants in the standards task and this electronic government initiative.  Public Technology Inc., is the non-profit technology organization for all cities and counties in the United States. The National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/County Management Association, three primary local government associations, provide PTI with its policy direction. Created in 1971, PTI is the only national organization dedicated to furthering the use of technology in both cities and counties, for both elected officials and professional managers. Through collective research and development efforts in its member jurisdictions, PTI creates and advances technology-based products, services, and enterprises for all cities and counties and has been an active leader in e-government.  The PTI Leadership is comprised of diverse local leaders from across the country.

Most importantly PTI has obtained the endorsement of three key local government organizations to serve as local government coordinator for Geospatial One-Stop Project. The National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/County Management Association have agreed to support the efforts of PTI in coordinating the overall involvement of these organizations in this e-government initiative. The period of performance for this effort is for 12 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by August 12, 2002. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center's Headquarters Procurement Office is currently conducting a progressive competition to acquire global land-cover change data and data products as a continuation of the 30-year-old Landsat Program.  Currently designated as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), LDCM is the next component of the Landsat program being conducted jointly by NASA and USGS.  The goals of the LDCM are in keeping with the Landsat programmatic goals stated in the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 and the Commercial Space Act of 1998.  This policy requires the Landsat Program to provided data into the future, that are sufficiently consistent with previous Landsat data to allow the detection and quantitative characterization of changes in/on the land surface of the globe. This procurement will be conducted using full and open competition procedures in two distinct phases:  Formulation and Implementation.  During Formulation, offerors develop the preliminary design of the system that will acquire the data, business plans and other relevant documentation.  On March 28, 2001, NASA awarded formulation phase contracts to DigitalGlobe of Longmont, Colorado, and Resource21 of Denver, Colorado.  The formulation phase contracts each have a nine- month period of performance, and will be completed in December 2002.  The competition for the Implementation Phase will build on the results of the Formulation Phase, and the award criteria for the Implementation Phase will include successful completion of the specified Formulation Phase Requirements.  Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only the Formulation Phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the Implementation Phase.  However, any responsible source may submit a proposal for the Implementation Phase.  Upon request, prospective offerors for the Implementation phase other than the Formulation Phase contractors will be provided all material officially furnished to the formulation phase contractors necessary to submit a proposal.  To be considered for the Implementation Phase award, offerors must demonstrate design maturity equivalent to that of the Formulation Phase Contractors, such demonstration to include any Formulation Phase deliverables upon which the Implementation Phase award may be based.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  NASA intends to release a draft version of the Implementation Phase Request for Proposal (RFP) for consideration and comment on/about September/October 2002.  This draft RFP will be posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service Web site at http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=04.  This draft RFP is for information and planning purposes.  No proposal is requested, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this draft RFP.  Potential Offerors and LDCM data users are invited to comment on all aspects of the solicitation, including the requirements, proposal instruction, and evaluation approach.  If your comments include recommendations for revisions, you must provide your rationale for such revisions for the comments to be considered.  NASA intends to release the final Implementation Phase RFP in December 2002/January 2003 timeframe.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments.  Any referenced numbered notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html.  The draft RFP will provide instructions as to the location and method of providing any comments.  If you have any questions, you may contact the Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, at (301) 286-4223.  An ombudsman has been appointed. NASA has uploaded with this notice a pre-release of the Draft LDCM Data Policy and a Draft Data Rights Table for comment.  All comments on these prerelease documents should be sent to the NASA Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, by email at jbecker@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov, or by facsimile at 301-286-7434.   To the extent practicable, NASA intends to pre-release additional sections of the RFP for comment prior to formal release of the draft RFP.  Any such pre-release is considered a market research tool and is provided for information and planning purposes only.  No response to any prerelease information is required, but comments may be submitted to the Contracting Officer if desired.  These pre-releases will be announced by posting a notice on the NAIS, directing the offeror to the LDCM public website where the pre-release information can be found.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for any such announcements.   NASA intends to hold a Pre-Solicitation Conference, tentatively scheduled for December 2002, prior to release of the final RFP.  The exact location, date, and time of this conference will be announced in a subsequent NAIS notice.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet web site for this subsequent announcement. NASA is also using this notice to assess the availability of electronic and information technology that meets all or part of the applicable accessibility standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board at 36 CFR part 1194.  Potential offerors may submit comments at any time to the Contracting Officer, Jim Becker, at jbecker@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.   See numbered note 26. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 54171.

<DESC>As a result of the FAA market survey announced on May 22, 2002, the FAA intends to negotiate a contract with Technology Service Corporation, Silver Spring, Maryland on a single source basis to provide software development/support, technical services and development of cultural databases to assist the Terminal Surveillance Product Team, AND-440, meet the FAA requirement to deploy Airport Surveillance Radar-11 (ASR-11) systems.  Technology Service Corporation has developed a computer based Radar Support System (RSS) to perform radar siting analysis.  With the RSS, the FAA can determine the optimum site for placement of the antenna at ASR-11 sites without the need for on-site surveys. <P> The FAA is implementing the ASR-11 Procurement Program.  This program will replace the aging ASR-7 and ASR-8 systems and the ATCBI-4 and 5 systems.  Replacement of these primary and radar systems also ensure that the FAA can deploy systems capable of providing digital input to the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System.  One hundred and eight ASR-11 systems are scheduled for deployment.  Part of the procurement program involves identifying an optimum site at which to locate and install the ASR-11 radar.  This process is called "radar siting." <P> This procurement with Technology Service Corporation will permit the FAA to use the Radar Support System for radar siting analysis to keep pace with the radar production schedule of the ASR-11 Program. <P>

<SOLNBR>DTFH68-02-R-00001
<RESPDATE>091702

<DESC>Solicitation Number DTFH68-02-R-00001 is synopsized as a Request for Proposal (RFP) as described below.  The estimated price range for this study is between $100,000 and $300,000.  

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
On several Central Federal Land highway Division (CFLHD) past MSE retaining wall projects (Generals Highway in Sequoia National Park, General Hitchcock Highway and the Young-North Highway (currently under construction) in Arizona, Zion National Park in Utah, and Icehouse Road in California) shoring systems have been required to maintain sufficient roadway width for traffic passage while building the permanent retaining wall system.  The shoring system is typically abandoned in place and not incorporated in the permanent MSE retaining wall solution even though it may continue to provide significant earth retention throughout the life of the project.  This practice may lead to over-conservatively designed walls and more environmental impact and construction cost than necessary.  This study is to develop a design approach for incorporating shoring into permanent MSE walls and to evaluate how and where this can be done to reduce cost and impact without reducing performance.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential for incorporating shoring walls into permanent fill-side retaining walls and to evaluate the impact to design and construction cost, environmental impact, and construction schedule.  This work includes developing a design manual that outlines an approach to identifying projects that would benefit from a combined shoring/final wall system.  The design manual will present criteria to be addressed and an approach for design and construction.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  
The following tasks will be required
	Task 1 - Project Initiation and Planning
Task 2 - Development of Preliminary Design Approach
Task 3 - Instrumentation of Test Wall
Task 4 - Finalize Design Approach and Prepare Report

BREAKDOWN OF CHRONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 
1. Initiate and plan the work (Task 1); 2. Conduct state-of-practice study (Task1/Task 2); 3. Develop focus for this study based on (1.) (Task 1); 4  Propose a design and construction approach (Task 2); 5. Prepare an interim report on state of practice and proposed approach (Task 2); 6. Design a shoring/MSE wall for testing (Task 3); 7. Develop instrumentation and testing plan for wall and predict observations (Task 3); 8. Construct test wall (Task 3); 9. Install instrumentation and take initial instrument readings (Task 3); 10. Load-test or observe test wall with subsequent instrument readings (Task 3); 11. Prepare interim report on test wall performance (Task 3); 12. Reconcile the proposed approach (3.) with test wall observations (9.) (Task 3/Task 4); 13.

<DESC>NPS Traffic Monitoring Program, Coverage Count and Data Reporting Project   -   This will be a professional services contract to conduct extensive traffic data coverage counting, and traffic data processing along with traffic data generated from a system of continuous traffic counters, for the production of a system-wide Traffic Data Report for the National Park Service (NPS). The current program entails 33 park units across the country.  Latest coverage counts were produced for the NPS 1994 Traffic Data Report.  In total, the coverage counts will consist of approximately 400 48-hour volume count locations, and approximately 60 vehicle classification locations and 50 vehicle occupancy counts locations.  The collected data will be processed and adjusted by approximately 100 continuous traffic counters that are currently in place for the Traffic Monitoring Program, operated and maintained by the Field Operations Technical Support Center of the NPS in Denver, Colorado.  The traffic data is to be presented graphically in the form of maps, charts and tables and be packaged as the updated (2003) Traffic Data Report. The processed traffic data and characteristics captured by this survey will be electronically implemented into a Geographical Information System/Database (GIS) intended to link and be compatible with the NPS' existing Road Inventory Program and Bridge Inventory Program, and with the various (Safety, Pavement, Congestion) Management Systems currently being developed by the NPS in partnership with the FHWA.  The needs and priorities for this Traffic Monitoring Program are specific to NPS' planning and programming activities, and are not necessarily for the national Highway Performance Monitoring System.  Nonetheless the NPS Program could supplement the special needs of State agencies.  In this regard, the FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide shall be invoked where applicable for guidelines in performing this work, where such work would not explicitly be described in the Scope of Work.  The work is intended to commence in Fall 2002, with a target completion of the coverage counts in Summer 2003.  The subsequent Report and GIS implementation is to be completed and ready for use and distribution by January 2004.  The value of this contract is estimated at $400,000.  The selection criteria will include: (1) Recent experience of the firm in providing expansive traffic data collection and processing services, including the firm's capability to effectively mobilize and control a data collection team; (2) Professional qualifications of key individuals to be assigned; (3) Formal quality control/quality assurance procedures of the firm in effect and related to the nature of work; (4) Past performance on other contracts, including any awards received or references that may be contacted; (5) Percentage of minorities and women, by general work classification.  Note that criteria (1) through (4) are enumerated in descending, yet closely equal, importance while criteria (5) is of lesser importance.  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist minority, women-owned, and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning the STLP, please call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  A Sources Sought Synopsis was released on 6 June 2002, with no amendments, under the project entitled, ?SatAC Support Contract?.   This announcement is to notify all interested parties that Det 8 Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland AFB NM anticipates releasing a solicitation F29601-02-R-0006 on or about 15 August 2002 entitled, ?Space Object Awareness Research (SOAR)?.  AFRL?s Directed Energy (DE) Directorate?s Satellite Assessment Center (SatAC) is the Air Force-chartered organization that evaluates directed energy effects on space systems and performs assessments of space system susceptibilities to directed energy sources for the Department of Defense (reference DoD Instruction 3100.11) and develops tools to perform satellite and space systems technical analyses.  Space systems are defined to include satellites, missiles (tactical and ballistic), and the respective supporting architectures.   To support this objective, SatAC is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed on-site at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland AFB NM, and at contractors' facilities, and at third-party facilities:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information; (B) System Assessments; (C) Computer Science Support.  Descriptions of each of these major areas follows:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information includes obtaining, analyzing, and utilizing information in order to develop detailed system structural and functional models.  (B) Space system assessments are physics-based and include interactions with space weather, laser, radio frequency, high-power microwave, and other directed energy mechanisms from ground, air, space, or other emission sources.  Assessments include vulnerability analysis, astrodynamics, and other relevant aspects of system-level analyses.  (C) Computer Science Support encompasses development and use of software and databases to support system modeling, system assessment, assessment methodology automation, smart data fusion techniques and methods as applied to:   Space Situational Awareness (SSA), databases (multi-tier and relational), artificial intelligence, and automated tools/graphical user interfaces (GUIs) delivered to operational DoD customers.  A primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support SatAC research programs such as Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in support of DoD information dominance requirements for space.

Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
Miami, Florida


The United States Government intends to award a five year firm, ten year lease, using other than full and open competition to Centennial Express of Miami, Florida.  The lease will be for 10,535 rentable square feet of fully serviced space with termination rights after five years.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government?s intent to award this lease under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above lease acquisition should provide their written comments to Glynda Grieve, Contracting Officer, at glyndam.grieve@gsa.gov or to her attention at General Services Administration, Realty Services Division, Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.

<DESC>s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide assistance in specific areas of its extramural Program, with particular emphasis on the functions of the network of action/decision points committees which guide the progression of potentially useful anticancer and anti-AIDS agents through the entire preclinical drug discovery and development process. The activities of the DTP Program extend from the acquisition and input of new natural and synthetic materials into the system through the initial and secondary evaluations and subsequent preclinical development phases leading to approval for Phase I clinical trials.

In addition, these kits were originally utilized because they provide the greatest rate of sensitivity at less than 2 picograms/ml, and the final response time is less than three hours.   Other functional features required of such kits, include: 1) 96 determinations per plate; 2) a standard curve range of 26 to 1,000 pg/ml or broader; 3) sample types such as serum, EDTA, Heparin or Sodium Citrate Plasma, Urine, and Culture Supernatants; 4) a 50 ml/well sample size; 5) an intraassay coefficient variable of less than seven (7) percent; 6) an interassay coefficient variable of less than seven (7) percent; 7) a wavelength of between 400 and 450 nm; and 8) a specificity of natural and recombinant human IFN interferon gamma.  The required kits also contain precoated stripwell plates, two vials of lyophilized standard, standard diluent, bitinylated antibody reagent, wash buffer, streptavidin-HRP concentrate, streptavidin HRP dilution buffer, premixed TMB substrate solution, stop solution, and adhesive plate covers.   Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of experiment in progress.  Pierce Chemical Company is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the above kits with the stated unique features and to ensure the continuity of the ongoing studies without introducing new variables.   However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 17, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue Request for Offer (RFO)56648-242 for a prototype antenna, digital receiver, and phase and amplitude control systems for the L-Band Scatterometer scientific investigation. The Scatterometer is an aircraft instrument that will work with the existing L-Band Electronic Scanned Thinned Array Radiometers (ESTAR) and ESTAR 2-D. The antenna shall operate at 1.26 GHz with control circuits to beamform in 2 degree increments selected in the +/- 50 degree cross-track scan angle range, The digital receiver must be equipped with Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) that can accept Scatterometer and ESTAR functionality requirements. This will develop a more complete data product for studying soil moisture and sea surface salinity. The long term objective is to combine the ESTAR capabilities and this Scatterometer into RadSTAR to provide optimum capabilities using a common set of hardware, without mechanical scanning, leading to future space borne missions. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from ProSensing, Inc. of Amherst, MA pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  ProSensing was awarded a NASA grant to determine the feasibility of the Scatterometer and this firm has been selected to continue the instrument into the prototype phase. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 16, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute(EOHSI), of  Piscataway, NJ 08854, for Development and field validation of Passive Aldehyde and Ketone Sampler (PAKS-DNSH) method for the collection and alalysis of acrolein and other aldehydes and ketones in support of the Human Exposure Analysis Branch in the Research Triangle Park, NC (RTP).  This procurement is for continued method development and making modifications to the recently developed  analytical (PAKS-DNSH) method developed by researchers at Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI), UMDNJ and Rutgers University. EPA believes that EOHSI is the only source capable of providing the required services based on previous experience. EOHSI is the only known  source with the necessary background and expertise to perform the required services within the prescribed time frame, i.e., FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  EOHSI has the staff and expertise of recently working and using  the PAKS DNSH method indicating improved recovery of the chemical acrolein (60%) when compared to the currently used DNPH method (20%).  Both methods are suitable for the collection and analysis of other aldehydes and ketones typically monitored in ambient and indoor air; however, this method shows  promise for the analysis of acrolein as well.  Under this project, the contractor shall further develop the method in order to improve the stability and recovery of acrolein.  Objective:  The specific objective for this project is to: Optimize the current PAKS DNSH method for the collection and  analysis of acrolein while maintaining acceptable results for the other aldehydes and ketones for which the method was originally developed.  The method will subsequently be tested through field validation whereby the contracting laboratory will provide sampling materials and sample analysis to  selected State and EPA Trends monitoring sites for PAKS collection.  PAKS method results will be compared to DNPH method results collected at the same specified Trends monitoring sites.  Special supporting equipment such as standards loading systems and analytical detectors necessary for conducting  the research are already in place.  In order to conduct the research, the laboratory would need to demonstrate that they can achieve the EOSHI published results regarding PAKS method aldehyde and ketone recoveries, stabilities, detection limits, diffusion sampling rates, cartridge preparation, and  analytical results.  This is a time critical effort in order to coordinate the field verification with the states monitoring at the Trends sites.  The performance period will be from date of award through 07 June 2004.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services  should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  No Solicitation is available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response  (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response no later than 19 August 2002 to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Joy Kimble (MC-E105-02), Contracts Management Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a contract with the Insurance Services Office (ISO) to continue with Phase II, which is an initiative that addresses the need to reduce fire losses within the rural regions of America. Specifically, FEMA and ISO began to inform local officials, including chief fire executives and planners, about the need to insure planning for rural water supplies for firefighting as an integral component to the local community?s fire defense master plan.  There is a need to maintain consistency in the two phases of this project.  ISO possesses an intimate knowledge of and contributed to the work conducted in the project?s Phase I.  The project is built around the copyrighted ISO Fire Suppression Grading Schedule manual.  The Schedule is universally accepted as a primary measurement tool for rural fire service effectiveness.  The objective of this project is to (1) increase the awareness level of the public officials, chief fire executives, water management personnel and others regarding the severity of fire risks in the rural setting and the need to insure reliable water supplies as an integral part of the local fire defense master plan; and (2) using the USFA master planning model as a template, develop and subsequently provide to local officials alternative water supply planning and operation guides and related sources.  If your firm is capable of performing the work, you are requested to submit a capability statement.  The minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in the following areas:  (1) Legal ability to use the copyrighted ISO Fire Suppression Grading Schedule manual; (2) Intimate knowledge of the rural water supply problem and their grading of rural fire department performance on behalf of the insurance industry; (3)  Proprietorship of methodologies and related insurance rating concepts referenced within the project; 4)  Field experience and sole possession of referenced data pertaining to effective methods of providing rural water supplies for fire suppression;  and  (5) Long term experience/expertise in the development of rural water supply methodologies.  Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit three copies of their capability statement within fifteen (15) calendar days of this notice.  Information furnished should include:  (1) The number and professional qualifications of technical and other appropriate personnel;  
(2) Company experience related to the proposed project; (3) A current financial statement; (4) Other literature which demonstrates the minimum capabilities listed above.  The Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses.  If the evaluation of the responses received concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, then this acquisition will become a Sole Source Procurement and no further synopsis will be issued.  SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22.

<DESC>The IRS intends to make award, on a sole-source basis, to IntelliEngine, Inc./Exigen under other than full and open competition procedures under the statutory authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source.  It is anticipated that a firm, fixed-price contract will be awarded for these services.  The performance period will not exceed 12 months from the award date.  Award is anticipated by Oct. 1, 2002.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these services is 523210; the small business size standard is $18,000,000.  Numbered note 22 applies to this acquisition. The Office of Research seeks contractor support to complete the technical development of the SCPM prototype.  In particular, the engine manager must be improved and a more useful user interface must be developed.  In particular, the IRS would like to see the following functionality added: Reformulate Primal Simplex Model to account for necessary follow-on support required in other areas and territories (and operating divisions); Develop output database to support strategic planning process.  Database can be linked to input database; and Implement Revised Primal Simplex Model into SCPM framework.   SCPM is a complex set of mathematical equations consisting of an objective function and thousands of constraints.  The constraints model the workload, workforce, budget, workforce transitions, and hiring decisions.  The constraints also include hiring and firing restrictions, attrition rates, career ladder promotions, and locality pay.  SCPM also requires very specialized skills.  First, it requires knowledge of operations research, particularly linear programming and constraint propagation.  Second, it requires knowledge of C++ and Java programming languages and object oriented design.  Third, it requires knowledge and experience using the ILOG optimization suite (Solver, Planner, and CPLEX).  ILOG is a collection of C++ libraries and functions designed to assist businesses in the modeling and solving of complex resource allocation and scheduling problems.  The mission of the Internal Revenue Service is to "provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax laws with integrity and fairness to all".  To support this mission, the Assistant Commissioner (Research and SOI) directed the Office of Research to develop a model to identify alternative allocations of enforcement resources that adhere to the Service's mission.  The model's objective function, consistent with the Service's mission of applying the tax laws with integrity and fairness to all, seeks to maximize total revenue collected.  Total revenue collected includes both direct enforcement revenue and indirect revenue-the amount of voluntary compliance that can be attributed to IRS activities (e.g., deterrence, taxpayer service).  This resource allocation model has been named the Strategic Compliance Planning Model (SCPM).  The IRS is beginning the sixth phase of development in the Strategic Compliance Planning Model (SCPM).  In phases 1 and 2, the IRS developed and enhanced a workload driven resource allocation engine (meaning workload prioritization drives the resource allocation process).  Phase 3 resulted in the development of a workforce engine, where IRS workforce decisions to hire, promote, or to transition resources from one position to another drive the selection of workload.  While the workload engine and the workforce engine run independently, they do work in conjunction with each other through an engine manager.  A prototype engine manager with limited functionality (ability to call each engine) was also developed as part of phase 3.  During Phase 4, the engine manager was improved and greatly enhanced the solution algorithm.  In particular, the IRS implemented automated linkages between the two engines through the engine manage to "optimize" the allocation of resources. In phase 4, IRS improved the productivity calculations estimated in the workload engine and used by the simplex algorithm in the workforce engine.  In phase 5, the model was modified to reflect the new organizational structure and additional engine functionality was added.  At the same time, a user interface was added with the underlying data being housed in a new database.  Inquiries/notice of interest  may be sent via e-mail to:  james.h.geiser@irs.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Amendment A0003 to Solicitation DAAE30-02-R-0411. In Section M.6, FAR 15.306 Exchanges with offerors after receipt of prpoposals will be added as follows; M.6 15.306  Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals.  (a) Clarifications and award without discussions.  (1) Clarifications are limited exchanges, between the Government and offerors,  that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated. (2) If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given  the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals (e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.  (3) Award may be made without discussions if the solicitation states that the  Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. If the solicitation contains such a notice and the Government determines it is necessary to conduct discussions, the rationale for doing so shall be  documented in the contract file (see the provision at 52.215-1) (10 U.S.C. 2305(b)(4)(A)(ii) and 41 U.S.C. 253b(d)(1)(B)). (b) Communications with offerors before establishment of the competitive range. Communications are exchanges, between the Government and offerors, after receipt of proposals, leading to establishment of the competitive range. If a competitive range is to be established, these communications -    (1) Shall be limited to the offerors described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)   (1)(ii) of this section and -      (i) Shall be held with offerors whose past performance information is the        determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive     range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance      information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond;      and     (ii) May only be held with those offerors (other than offerors under       paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) whose exclusion from, or inclusion in,      the competitive range is uncertain;   (2) May be conducted to enhance Government understanding of proposals; allow   reasonable interpretation of the proposal; or facilitate the Government's    evaluation process. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal    deficiencies or material omissions, materially alter the technical or cost    elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal. Such    communications may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of      establishing the competitive range;   (3) Are for the purpose of addressing issues that must be explored to    determine whether a proposal should be placed in the competitive range. Such    communications shall not provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise its    proposal, but may address -      (i) Ambiguities in the proposal or other concerns (e.g., perceived     deficiencies, weaknesses, errors, omissions, or mistakes (see 14.407)); and    (ii) Information relating to relevant past performance; and   (4) Shall address adverse past performance information to which the offeror     has not previously had an opportunity to comment. (c) Competitive range.  (1) Agencies shall evaluate all proposals in accordance with 15.305(a), and, if  discussions are to be conducted, establish the competitive range. Based on the  ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the contracting  officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly  rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) After evaluating all proposals in accordance with 15.305(a) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the contracting officer may determine that the number  of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the  competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.  Provided the solicitation notifies offerors that the competitive range can be limited for purposes of efficiency (see 52.215-1(f)(4)), the  contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (10 U.S.C. 2305(b)(4) and 41 U.S.C. 253b(d)). (3) If the contracting officer, after complying with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, decides that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the  competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful  offerors in accordance with 15.503. (4) Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may  request a debriefing (see 15.505 and 15.506). (d) Exchanges with offerors after establishment of the competitive range.  Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source environment, between the Government and offerors, that are undertaken with the intent of  allowing the offeror to revise its proposal. These negotiations may include  bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion, alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, technical   requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract. When  negotiations are conducted in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment of the competitive range and are called discussions. (1) Discussions are tailored to each offeror's proposal, and shall be conducted by the contracting officer with each offeror within the competitive range. (2) The primary objective of discussions is to maximize the Government's ability to obtain best value, based on the requirement and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. (3) The contracting officer shall, subject to paragraphs (d)(4) and (e) of this  section and 15.307(a), indicate to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award, significant weaknesses, deficiencies, and other aspects  of its proposal (such as cost, price, technical approach, past performance, and terms and conditions) that could, in the opinion of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially the proposal's potential for award.  The scope and extent of discussions are a matter of contracting officer  judgment. In discussing other aspects of the proposal, the Government may, in situations where the solicitation stated that evaluation credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory minimums, negotiate with  offerors for increased performance beyond any mandatory minimums, and the  Government may suggest to offerors that have exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were removed and the offered price decreased. (4) If, after discussions have begun, an offeror originally in the competitive  range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated offerors being considered for award, that offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range  whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or  whether or not the offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision (see 15.307(a) and 15.503(a)(1)). (e) Limits on exchanges. Government personnel involved in the acquisition shall  not engage in conduct that -  (1) Favors one offeror over another; (2) Reveals an offeror's technical solution, including unique technology, innovative and unique uses of commercial items, or any information that would compromise an offeror's intellectual property to another offeror; (3) Reveals an offeror's price without that offeror's permission. However, the contracting officer may inform an offeror that its price is considered by the Government to be too high, or too low, and reveal the results of the analysis supporting that conclusion. It is also permissible, at the Government's discretion, to indicate to all offerors the cost or price that the Government's price analysis, market research, and other reviews have identified as reasonable (41 U.S.C. 423(h)(1)(2));  (4) Reveals the names of individuals providing reference information about an offeror's past performance; or (5) Knowingly furnishes source selection information in violation of 3.104 and 41 U.S.C. 423(h)(1)(2).

<DESC>This Modification is to correct the RFP Number which may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page. The solicitation announcement should read as follows:  The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide for the storage and distribution of their repository of chemical and drug samples.  This contract is responsible for the web-based acquisition of new compounds for testing and the receipt, storage, distribution, documentation, and inventory of synthetic compounds, bulk chemical drugs and crystalline natural products which have been identified as potential anticancer and anti-AIDS agents.  This effort also includes the plating of approximately 140,000 compounds in the DTP open repository.  The contractor shall take responsibility for all tasks of the repository.  The responsibilities shall include the receipt, weighing, distribution and storage of new and previously acquired chemical samples.  All new potential chemotherapeutic agents evaluated by the Program, whether single compounds or plated materials, are received and registered in the Program by this contract.  The contractor is also responsible for the management of correspondence to and from the compounds suppliers; for creation, using the web-based acquisition procedures, and maintenance of the chemical database; systematic file and record keeping; and reacquisition of needed samples for continued in vitro testing and subsequent in vivo studies.  The contractor shall provide for the proper disposal of samples which have been returned from various screening laboratories, and  shall prepare Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific compounds as required by the Project Officer.  In addition, the Contractor controls the inventory of approximately 400,000 chemical samples, which are a valuable resource to the Program and the extramural community.  PHARMACEUTICAL, CHEMICAL, OR BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS COMPETITION SINCE THE COMPOUND SAMPLES AND COMPOUND INFORMATION STORED IN THE DTP COMPUTER SYSTEM IS OF A PROPRIETARY NATURE.  A pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.  It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, term (level of effort) type contract award will be made for a five-year period of performance with incremental funding each year.  To assist in the preparation of a proposal, the Government considers the effort to be 28,500 direct labor hours annually.  The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately 03/27/2002.  The proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  The RFP # N02-CM-27010-28 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Carolyn E. Barker, Contract Specialist at e-mail: cb123d@nih.gov; FAX:  (301)402-6699; Telephone: (301)496-8620.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI).  The USAF Force Protection (FP) Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial off-the-shelf equipment that could be used to support a remote detection, challenge and response (REDCAR) system.  Currently, Air Force installations and forward deployed units have limited resources to detect, assess, challenge, or quickly neutralize an attack.  The scarcity of detection and surveillance technology results in a low probability of detecting, disrupting and neutralizing potential aggressors.  The problem magnifies as the small numbers of posted patrols can only provide a limited response.  Commanders at these installations are always seeking ways to increase the probability of detecting and preventing unauthorized intrusions.  This RFI looks at the use of technology to support an integrated system designed to carry out REDCAR using unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).  The integrated platform is intended to provide Air Force Installations with the means to delay or mitigate an aggressor's progress allowing Security Forces time to mount an effective counter.  Equipment supporting REDCAR will consist, in part, of a remote detection and challenge system.  The remote detection system should consist of sensors and digital surveillance equipment designed to provide long-range detection, assessment and identification though a video link.  The remote challenge system should be able to provide visual and audio cues, and provide an increasing/decreasing level of challenge based on the location of the incursion.  It should warn the intruder that he or she is approaching a restricted area and further incursion will result in an armed response.  The remote challenge audio cue should be programmable in the language dialect of the operational area.  The integration and management of both systems should be with minimal or no human intervention.  The equipment should require minimal training to deploy and operate, be of minimum size and weight, and be mountable on an all terrain, all weather, day-night remotely operated UGV.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical technology available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited AMB funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the Air Force, funding will be sought for concept and/or prototype demonstration.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the Secret level, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to Secret information.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 19 August 2002.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Steven Fuller of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at fullers@ctc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS MR. FULLER.  You may contact Mr. Fuller with any questions you may have at (814) 269-2627.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Offerors are advised that only the Air Force FP Battlelab is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<SUBJECT>A -- OPTIMIZED ARRAY FOR SPACE-BACKGROUND INFRARED SIMULATION (OASIS)
<DESC>INTRODUCTION: This is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA). The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNG) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development of advanced resistive array infrared scene projection integrated circuits (ICs) optimized for cryogenic operation and integration of those ICs into cryogenic infrared scene Projector Emitter Module's (Cryo-PEMs). Proposals in response to this PRDA must be received no later than 1:00 P.M. CST on 4 March 2002, addressed to Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, Bldg. 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn.: Ms Dona Dowdy-Merchant (AFRL/MNK). Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (May 2001)". Responders must reference the following number (MNK-PRDA-02-0004). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement. Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement. Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published. The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates. If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available.  B-- REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Technical Description: Through research and development programs such as the Wideband Infrared Scene Projector (WISP) and the Multi-Spectral Scene Projector (MSSP) programs, resistive array infrared scene projector technology has demonstrated such desirable qualities as broad spectral emission, flickerless images, high frame rates, and large dynamic ranges.  Although resistor array infrared scene projector technology has greatly matured under the WISP and MSSP programs there are areas in which additional development is required to meet the needs of the hardware-in-the-loop test and evaluation community.  One of these facilities, the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) at Eglin, is designed to support various current and future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) guided interceptor hardware development programs. This closed-loop simulator facility evaluates advanced state-of-the-art seeker and control system performance under varying mission scenarios. The resistive array infrared projection technology also has direct application in the evaluation of air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface guided weapons and submunitions, which use infrared seekers.  Because of the rapid evolution of sensor and signal processor technologies, it is imperative that related simulation technologies keep pace with the advances in guided interceptor technology.  (2) Technical Goals:  The overall objective of this program is to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in resistive array infrared scene projection technology. Goals in descending order of importance (most to least): (a) Optimize the emitter material, on-chip analog electronics and other design features to increased radiometric output under cryogenic/vacuum environmental conditions, (b) High framing rates (200 frames per second), (c) High spatial resolution (512x512 and 1024x1024), (d) Minimization of scene droop, (e) Snapshot array updates, (f) Flexible array and package design for array operation at ambient through cryogenic temperatures, (g) Maximization of array fabrication yield, (h) Programmable frame windowing (addressing reduced portion of array), and (i) Programmable multiplexing of the number of control lines (user can trade between data rate and cost of drive electronics).  The offerors may include additional areas for trade in the first phase of the program.  This three-phased program of which two phases are optional is a 36-month effort.  Phase I (6 months), Dual Design (Conservative and Aggressive), will encompass developing designs for both conservative and aggressive 512x512 cryogenic/vacuum resistive array, have a Preliminary Design Review (2 months from program kickoff) and end with the Critical Design Review of both conservative and aggressive designs.  The conservative design will be a low to medium risk approach concentrating on cryogenic operation and the following requirements: (a) KHILS Array Interface Electronics (AIE) Compatibility, (b) format - 512x512 raster, (c) Environment temperature - 50-80K optimized, (d) Environment Vacuum - 10e-8 Torr, (e) Radiometric maximum apparent temperature - 650K in MWIR and 500K in LWIR, (f) Radiometric minimum apparent temperature - Background environment, (g) Temporal response (without overdrive) - 0 percent to 90 percent of full radiometric output in 8msec MWIR at 80K and 100 percent to 10 percent of full radiometric output in 8msec LWIR at 80K, and (h) Control - Command range of 1-5V with settling time at buffer amp of less than 350nsec, Droop less than 1 percent radiometric output over 20 msec, and Uncorrected non-uniformity 10 percent maximum.  The aggressive design (high risk) will push the state-of-the-art.  The following is an example of an aggressive design's requirements: (a) On-board DACS, (b) format - 512x512, raster/snapshot, (c) Environment temperature - 20-300K, (d) Environment Vacuum - 10e-8 Torr, (e) Radiometric maximum apparent temperature - 700K in MWIR and 600K in LWIR, (f) Radiometric minimum apparent temperature - Background environment, (g) Temporal response (without overdrive) - 0 percent to 90 percent of full radiometric output in 5msec MWIR at 80K and 100 percent to 10 percent of full radiometric output in 5msec LWIR at 80K, and (h) Control - Command range of 1-5V with settling time at buffer amp of less than 300nsec, Droop less than 1 percent radiometric output over 20 msec, and Uncorrected non-uniformity 10 percent maximum.  Phase II (12-month option), Manufacture/Test Phase, will include two array fabrication runs (one using the conservative design and one using the aggressive design) and four mounted and delivered arrays, two from each run.  Phase III (18-month option), Down-select and Optimize, will down-select the most favorable array design from Phase II array test data, optimize that design, perform two more optimization fabrication runs in series (implementing a number of the more complex development goals defined above, such as 1024x1024 array size), and end with the mounting and delivery of four Phase III arrays and a final report.  The Government will be responsible for annealing, system installation, and characterization of all delivered arrays.   (3) Data Requirements:  The following data element  submittals are expected.  Suggested Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) are noted.  The contractor may propose additional elements or submittal of combined elements or DIDs as appropriate for the proposed program.  Electronic submittal is encouraged whenever feasible and cost-effective for the program.  Submittals are:  (a) Design drawings (DI-DRPR-81002A)  (b) Monthly status reports, including technical progress, programmatic issues, schedule, and appropriate disclosure of actual cost and labor expenditures.  Contractor-format CFSR are required during all phases of the contract.  (DI-MGMT-80368, -80909, -80269; DI-FNCL-80912; DI-MGMT-81468)  (c) Final technical report and a technology transfer report at end of program.  The final report, which will be published in DTIC, must document the entire effort (DI-MISC-80711).  The final report must be delivered to the Government in electronic form (Microsoft Word 97 or later format).  (d) A record (e.g., agenda, presentation materials, minutes, and tracking of associated action items) of required meetings. (DI-ADMN-81249, -81250, -81373).  (4) Meetings and Reviews: The contractor will be expected to host and conduct various responsibility to identify any equipment or property to be used whether contractor-owned and furnished or Government-owned and furnished.  The Government will assist in providing Government-owned property as appropriate and if available.

<SUBJECT>--This Special Notice combines previous two Special Notices, posted on 8-1-02, regarding D/SIDDOMS recompete for the TRICARE Management Activity Solicitation DASW01-02-R-0031
<DESC>NA To Prospective D/SIDDOMS 3 Vendors: The Government is in the process of finalizing the D/SIDDOMS 3 requirements and RFP and intends to issue the formal solicitation on or around September 1, 2002. The Government will respond to all questions received during Industry Day and immediately following, in the RFP as an attachment, or later as an RFP amendment.  Should a vendor feel that their question was not answered or have additional questions, the Gov ernment requests that they resubmit the question for consideration after the RFP release.  The Government will post the RFP through FEDBIZOPS and the DCC-W website.  The Government will not alert individual vendors of the RFP release. All future correspondences relating to the D/SIDDOMS 3 contract shall be submitted to: dsiddoms3@tma.osd.mil.  Vendors should be aware that at this time the Government is not responding to information requests relating to this procurement.  Upon RFP releas e the Government will respond to vendor inquiries in accordance with applicable procedures and regulations.  Upon RFP release all questions for information must be submitted to the above email address (dsiddoms3@tma.osd.mil)  as phone calls, emails to any other addresses, and any hard copies will not be honored or responded to.  The Government will not respond to any inquires or questions until after RFP release. For the purpose of teaming arrangements the Government is attaching the organizational conflict of interest clause.  Respectfully, Alex Graham Contracting Officer Defense Contracting Command - Washington Attachement: Proposed Organizational Conflict of Interest clause for D/SIDDOMS 3 THE D/SIDDOMS 3 RFP is being issued as a full and open competition under which all contractors eligible for federal contracts are encouraged to participate.  The intent of this conflict of interest clause is to prevent any actual or apparent organizational  conflict of interest with TMA.   The D/SIDDOMS 3 RFP is being issued to obtain “Program Development / Execution Support”.  It restricts Contractor participation in program activities to one of two, mutually exclusive categories:  Program Management Contractor Support and Program Developme nt/ Execution Support.  Contractors may submit offers in either of these categories; however, no contractor or key contractor personnel who have performed work in the Program Management category will be eligible to perform in the D/SIDDOMS 3 Program Develo pment category for a minimum of two (2) years after the conclusion of performance in the Program Management category, such ineligibility to include performing as a prime contractor, subcontractor or consultant.  Because of the ongoing nature of the D/SIDDO MS program, the Government reserves the unilateral right to extend this restriction beyond the minimum two (2) year period whenever doing so is unilaterally determined by the Government to be required to avoid or mitigate against the risk of OCIs.  The Gov ernment reserves the unilateral right to impose, on a case-by-case basis, the same restrictions for contractors or key contractor personnel previously engaged in Program Development category work subsequently seeking Program Management category work.  The Government reserves the unilateral right to determine  key personnel status for purposes of this clause. The Contractor's attention is drawn to FAR Sections 3 and 9 for reference. Examples of Program Management contracts include, but are not limited to, the PMI contract, PMI BPA, and D/SIDDOMS II – Lot 1.  If a contractor has or is performing working under these contracts or others in support of TMA, those contractors may still part icipate in the D/SIDDOMS 3 solicitation; however, if awarded a D/SIDDOMS 3 contract as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant, they will be required to apply with the conditions stated above. Teaming Arrangements for D/SIDDOMS 3 The Government is looking for best value contractor approaches to  achieve the tasking outlined in the RFP.  Consistent with the D/SIDDOMS 3 Organizational Conflict of Interest clause, the FAR, the DFARS and AFARS, the Government requires in every proposal for every order under D/SIDDOMS 3, specific information about pro posed subcontractors, consultants and key personnel.  Such information will include, at minimum, the prior TMA contract and delivery or task order history of such firms and personnel.  If the proposed use of such firms or personnel raises questions of pote ntial real or apparent OCIs, the contractor will be required to note such questions and propose appropriate mitigation plans.  However, notwithstanding any such mitigation plan submitted in any such proposal, the Government reserves the right not to award any such order on grounds of a real or apparent OCI which the Government has unilaterally determined would not be adequately mitigated.  The Government is imposing an additional restriction on the teaming approach that each vendor may propose as a subcontr actor multiple times but no prime contractor can be a subcontractor to another prime.  Additionally, on each task/delivery order, prime contractors will need to identify the specific, preapprove subcontractors that will be used, the primary role of the sub contractor, the labor categories, rates and estimated or fixed level of effort for each subcontractor.

2.0 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The primary purpose of the vacuum systems covered by this RFQ is to allow Library operators to clean books, containers and other materials at an approximate rate of 4,000 books or book equivalents per day. After being cleaned, the books will be sorted at other stations by size, placed into special book boxes and transported to the Library of Congress Storage Facility at Fort Meade, Maryland.  

The two vacuum systems are be used continuously for one or more shifts per day for 5 days per week.  The systems are to be capable of  operation  with simple control inputs from operators.  




2.1 COMPONENTS

There are to be two independent duplicate HEPA vacuum systems, which are each to consist of the following major components:

Each system is to include a  48 inches long by 30 inches deep work station that is to be located as shown on the drawing.  Each  workstation is to include a book cleaning device as well as a vacuum hose with the necessary valves so that either the book cleaning device or the vacuum hose can be used. The vacuum hoses are to be equipped with soft brushes of different types and shapes that are safe, compatible with, and useful for book cleaning operations. Brushes are to be easily removed and exchanged with new  brushes as they become worn.

Dust canisters are to be located on the floor level near the turbines.  The two vacuum lines shall be installed from the turbines to the workstations located 25-35 feet away in a near-by room.  Exhaust from the vacuum generators will be filtered through a HEPA filter before emptying into the room.  Vacuum equipment shall be installed in accordance with approved drawings and must not encroach upon dedicated exit access-ways, aisles, or corridor or otherwise obstruct occupant egress.

Noise generated by the system must not exceed OSHA's action level (in dB) and local standards. The system should be a quiet system that minimizes impact on staff in the room while working with the vacuum cleaning system.  Heat build-up in work station area and room should be negligible.  Noise dampening materials shall not lead to heat build-up or provide access and maintenance problems.  The vendor shall provide the final operational decibel level at the work station and in the processing area and locker area next to the turbine room

Each bench is to be equipped with a horizontal slot with a horizontal set of brushes and a vertical slot with a vertical brush so covers and tops of books can be cleaned simultaneously.  By turning the books the equipment should be effective in cleaning all sides of the books.  The vacuum slots should maximize the flow of the dirt into the vacuum system, rather than falling onto the table, or elsewhere. The benches should have the capability of being adjusted easily by a crank or electrically from a height of 30" to 42" above the floor.

The vacuum lines at each workstation are to have adjustable bleed valves to allow for control of the amount of suction. The individual vacuum work stations are to be equipped with suction gauges mounted on the hose connections.  There are to be individual low voltage controls at each workstation to actuate its vacuum generator.

Two portable clear Lexan prefilter interceptors are to be provided to catch material that might be accidentally pulled off of valuable book covers. These units will be located at each of the stations where the books are handled.  When the vacuum supply is connected to the device,  valuable material, which is pulled from a book, is to be caught in the Lexan box where it can be seen and easily retrieved by the operator. 





2.2 SYSTEM OPERATION

The operator will place a container of books measuring 21" x 15" x 12" high on one side of the 48" wide bench and a similar empty container on the other side of the bench.  The operator will then move books from the filled container to the work cleaning station and then to the empty container.  When the full container has been emptied the container is to be cleaned with the vacuum hose and moved to the opposite side of the bench to become the container to be filled. The hose at the workstation is primarily intended for cleaning containers from which the dirty books have been removed although the hose may also be used for cleaning of books and other items.  The hose should be counter weighted to aid in preventing ergonomic problems.
