<DESC>On behalf of the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Dennehostso Boarding School, the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) plans to award a sole source simplified acquisition to Byrne & Associates located at 20801 W 94th Terrace Lenexa, KS 66220-3699.
Dennehotso Boarding School (DBS) is a restructuring school in the System of Support program and BIE Reads!  As such, the school is focused on improving student achievement in reading.  An external technical assistance provider, with a proven program in increasing student's achievement in reading, is needed to guide the improvement process and support the effective implementation of the K-8 reading core and intervention programs as outlined in the BIE Reads! and Systems of Support initiatives. The period of performance shall be July 10, 2010 through June 30, 2011. 
The objective of this requirement is to provide external technical assistance for the DBS reading program grades K-8 as required by the BIE's System of Support/BIE Reads!  The Contractor shall provide 20 days of on-site visits (most visits shall be 2 days in length); assist the school with the implementation of the three tier reading model; increase teaching staff skills for implementation of scientifically based reading instruction in the three tier reading model; increase reading coach and principal's knowledge of the three tier reading model; support school leadership in managing and processes required to increase Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) scores; conduct classroom visits and debriefing with teachers, reading coach, and principal; coach teachers in reading instruction; coach the reading coach and principal in research based best practices for instruction and leadership; provide strategies for instruction for annual reading growth and catch up growth; provide data analysis for Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS), Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), AIMS, SAT 10, Corrective Reading, Houghton Mifflin, and McDougal Littlell assessment scores; collaboratively plan with reading coach and principal reading program goals, professional development, and calendars/schedules; and provide reports including follow-up tasks, compliance with SOS/BIE Reads! requirements, recommendations for professional development, and identification of staff meeting proficient levels of instruction in the three tier reading model.
Byrne & Associates worked with DBS during the 2009-10 school year.  Extensive knowledge and experience with the school, students, staff, and data has been developed.  Specifically, Byrne & Associates has analyzed DBS reading data for AIMS, DIBELS, NWEA and Corrective Reading identifying gain and loss in reading for individual students and for the school as a whole.  Byrne & Associates has developed strong rapport with DBS teachers and education technicians, reading coach, principal, and students.  Byrne & Associates knows what professional development has been completed, what is scheduled for the 2010-11 school year, and exactly what professional development the teachers, education technicians, reading coach, and principal require to effectively improve the reading program. 
The knowledge that Byrne & Associates has developed will be the base that the school builds upon for the 2010-11 school year.  To use any other Contractor would set the school back by one year because the new Contractor would have to spend the year developing the knowledge of the school that exists with Byrne & Associates. As a result, this would cost the Government extra money to have to new Contractor gain this knowledge base.
Interested concerns capable of providing compatible services to the ones identified in this synopsis may submit a capability statement outlining their interest and capabilities to Cathleen.Fraser@bia.gov. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Following evaluation of capability statements, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer shall proceed with award to Byrne & Associates.

<p>Presently, USCIS is in the process of monitoring the administration and implementation of the new test. During the monitoring phase, USCIS will determine if any test items need to be revised or eliminated or if new test items should be developed. As USCIS proceeds with the monitoring and implementation phases, and, should USCIS determine that there is a need for modifications to the new test (e.g., moving from a paper-based test to an electronic-based test), USCIS will require guidance from the TAG. It is imperative that the new test remain scientifically sound, valid, reliable, and fair should it undergo any changes.</p>
<p>Additionally, USCIS' Office of Citizenship is mandated to develop educational materials and resources to help immigrants integrate into the United States and to prepare immigrants for the naturalization test. In order to adhere to this requirement, USCIS will need input from the TAG to ascertain that the educational materials and resources for the new test are developed at the correct educational level and are developed in a way that meets the needs of immigrant learners and the organizations that serve them.</p>
<p>As USCIS moves forward with full implementation of the new test, it will require the assistance of the TAG not only to provide guidance on the new test, but also on the educational materials and resources related to it.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of identifying and selecting a number of TAG candidates and ensure that there are sufficient TAG members throughout the duration of the contract, coordinate &amp; facilitate TAG meetings.</p>
<p>TAG members must have knowledge and/or experience in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in adult second language acquisition;<br />&bull; Expertise in adult English as a second language (ESL) instruction and methodology; <br />&bull; Knowledge of psychometrics in test development and/or test administration;<br />&bull; Experience or working knowledge of U.S. history/government, civics, social studies and/or political science;<br />&bull; Knowledge of the U.S. Department of Education's National Reporting System for Adult Education (NRS) ;<br />&bull; Knowledge or an understanding of the U.S. naturalization process;<br />&bull; Candidates must be a member of TESOL; <br />&bull; Candidates may not use any confidential information gained through participation on the TAG, or information not yet available to the general public for financial gain (i.e. authoring text books for profit); and<br />&bull; Geographic and ethnic diversity of working group members (strongly encouraged).</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition. The acquisition is expected to result in one Firm Fixed Price contract. The contract will be awarded for a one year base performance period with four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.</p>
<p>All questions concerning this competition must be directed in writing via email to the designated point of contact. No questions or inquiries will be accepted by telephone. The distribution of the resulting solicitation will be accomplished solely through FedBizOpps. Hard copies of the solicitation documents will not be available, therefore, no written, telephone, or facsimile requests for the document will be accepted. All future information about this acquisition, including the solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type:
<p>Presolicitation</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00187 (subject to change) for a program called The Impact of Climate on Ciguatoxin-Producing Dinoflagellates and Ciguatera Fish Poisoning Disease<br />The NAICS Code is 541620 with a small business size standard of $7 million.</p>
<p>Project Background:</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to obtain proposals from sources with capabilities or prior experience in examining the effects of climate change on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates and ciguatoxic fish, and the incidence of ciguatera in humans, in the Caribbean, St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands).</p>
<p>This requirement is written in the interest of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mission to ensure the safety of seafood to the consumer. The requirement augments parallel studies sponsored by CDC to address public health issues related to global climate change and ciguatera. This requirement will examine the effects of climate change on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates and ciguatoxic fish, and the incidence of ciguatera in humans, in the Caribbean (U.S. Virgin Islands). The project explores the hypothesis that climatic disturbances in reef areas affect the growth of these organisms, with subsequent and predictable changes in fish toxicity. Evidence is accumulating that the geographical distribution of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus spp.) and toxic fish are expanding, and linked to climate change. This effort shall support the collection of new environmental information, which will compliment CDC sponsored clinical and epidemiological studies of ciguatera. Knowledge of the effects of climate on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates, and their linkages to toxic fish, will improve the ability of FDA to monitor and control this critical food safety issue. This project will provide unique benefits to common goals of FDA and CDC in prevention of seafood-related illnesses.</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded with a base period of 36 months. This requirement is a full and open requirement. This announcement is not an RFP. The FINAL RFP solicitation may be an upload to this presolicitation notice. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments in writing to Emily.Hunt@fda.hhs.gov. It is up to interested parties to check this site for the release of the solicitation as it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated release date of the solicitation will be on or around June 30th, 2010. Please watch this synopsis for updated information (if any) to the release date. The anticipated award date for this effort is August 16, 2010.</p>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support from the Engineering, Science andTechnical Services (ESTS) contract which provides a wide range of engineering, scienceand technical support services to various programs and projects, including theConstellation Program's Ares I, Orion/Launch Abort System, and Ares V; the ShuttlePropulsion Program; and  International Space Station.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services by extending the current ESTS contract withJacobs Technology for 1 year.  The contract will be modified to extend the period ofperformance through September 30, 2011 and increase the IDIQ maximum quantity by $170million.  Approval of this action will allow for continuation and stability of theseservices through the upcoming retirement of the Space Shuttle and the Agency-levelprogrammatic decisions regarding the potential cancellation of the Constellation Programand transition into the new NASA direction proposed in the President's Budget Request forFiscal Year 2011. This extension will provide time for the Agency and Center to determinethe course of action for implementing this new direction, which in turn will allowappropriate planning for the recompetiiton of the ESTS contract.  MSFC intends toinitiate a competitive procurement for its follow-on requirements for engineering,scientific and technical services that will result in a new contract award(s) inSeptember 2011.This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority forU.S.C. 2304(c)(1), for the acquisition of supplies and services from only one responsiblesource and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inaccordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only fromthe original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it islikely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfillingthe agencys requirements. FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii) provides that use of this authority maybe appropriate in a situation when unique services are available from only one or alimited number of sources. Jacobs is uniquely positioned to continue providing the highly specialized engineeringand related services in support of Ares, Shuttle, and other Constellation requirementsduring this critical time of program retirements, cancellations, and transitions for thefollowing reasons:  (1) Jacobs has been the support contractor providing critical engineering and relatedskills to MSFC since initiation of the Ares project in July 2005.  As a result, Jacobshas developed within their management staff a unique knowledge and understanding ofrequirements, operations, and policies and processes across the various elements of theAres project and for other Constellation program elements.  Use of Jacobs existing andproven capabilities will permit the timely execution of significant tasks that arenecessary for achieving the Ares/Constellation milestones, including the critical designmilestones for Upper Stage and Vehicle Integration, should the Agency direct completionof those milestones prior to program cancellation.  A recompetition of the ESTS contractprior to the substantial completion of these critical milestones, or prior to theactivities that will be necessary with program cancellation, would introduce considerableattrition-related schedule and performance risks to the MSFC-managed Constellationrequirements. During this period in which MSFC will receive and execute Agency programdirection on Constellation, no other source is capable of 1) continuing to supportexisting Ares/Constellation requirements with the required engineering skills without asubstantial risk of unacceptable delays to the current mission, or 2) supporting anefficient and orderly closeout of those same contract activities with the pendingcancellation of the program. (2) While the Agency is making programmatic decisions with regard to Constellation, it isalso making decisions regarding the implementation of the new direction announced in theFY 2011 budget proposal.  New Center assignments have been announced and MSFC has learnedit will be involved in Heavy Lift and Propulsion Technology, Exploration PrecursorRobotic Missions, Exploration Technology Development and Demonstration, and SpaceTechnology Program.  In support of these new initiatives, MSFC needs further programdirection to determine its role in these new programs and, consequently, the skills andcapabilities required for the follow-on contract.  A recompetition of the ESTS contractprior to receiving clearer direction may result in a contract that would not adequatelymeet the engineering support needs of the Center in implementing its new role. Therefore, it is prudent to continue obtaining the needed engineering services from thecurrent provider during this transition period from Constellation to the new initiatives.(3) In support of Shuttle, Jacobs Technology has provided engineering and other relatedservices since 1989, and was a significant contributor to the MSFCs return-to-flightengineering efforts following the Space Shuttle Columbia accident.  Jacobs has a uniqueknowledge and understanding of the Shuttle Propulsion requirements and the Agencysinterest in the safe fly-out of Shuttle.  Jacobs Technology is uniquely positioned tocontinue providing the required engineering support to the MSFC Shuttle Propulsionelements while minimizing the risk to the successful completion of the Space ShuttleProgram (SSP). A recompetition of the ESTS contract prior to retirement of the Shuttlefleet would introduce unacceptable risks to the successful completion of SSP(4) Throughout the contract, Jacobs has demonstrated a unique ability to meet thefluctuating requirements for staffing to address a very wide range of supportingengineering skills required by MSFC.  Should staffing variations become necessary duringthis time, it would be in the best interest of all parties to take any actions prior to arecompetition of MSFCs engineering support requirements and potential transition ofsupport contractors.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to increase the maximum order amount of contract NNG06AZ12C withJ's Associates, LLC pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. Thisaction will not extend the performance/effective ordering period of the contract.The Water Treatment Program contract NNG06AZ12C is an indefinite delivery/indefinitequantity, firm fixed price contract. Quantities ordered under the contract schedule haveexceeded estimates and it is anticipated that the amount ordered under the contract willreach the maximum order amount in August 2010. The government is currently preparing afollow-on procurement for Facilities Operation and Maintenance (FOMS) at GSFC which willincorporate this requirement for water treatment services. The follow-on FOMS contract isdue to be awarded June 1, 2011. To avoid a break in water treatment service, theGovernment is increasing the maximum ordering amount of contract NNG06AZ12C to coverwater treatment services during the 10-month period from August 2010 until the servicesrollover into the follow-on FOMS contract.The current contract NNG06AZ12C requires the contractor to provide the personnel,materials, and equipment necessary to implement a comprehensive service-oriented WaterTreatment Program at NASA/GSFC. The objectives of the Water Treatment Program are tominimize, to the extent practical, the effects of water and biological agents on themetal surfaces inside GSFC's cooling tower, chilled water, steam generating systems, andother closed water systems in order to prolong the life and maximize the effectiveness ofthese systems.Continuous and consistent chemical water treatment is critical to the ongoing operationand condition of the heating and cooling equipment in GSFC's Central Plants. A break inservice poses an unacceptable risk to the support of mission activities on the Center bythe Central Plants.J's Associates, as the current incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of the on-sitefacilities and systems and personnel to provide uninterrupted continuation of missioncritical services. An interruption and restart of the services currently being performed,with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with the existing facilities and the specificrequirements of the Water Treatment Program contract, would greatly jeopardize theoperation of the Central Plants. Due to the time and substantial duplication of costsinvolved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, J's Associates is considered theonly contractor that can meet GSFC's needs given the short period of performance beforethe award of the FOMS follow-on contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases (NIAMS), requires the services of three to five contractors for a program entitled: “Ancillary and Complementary Research to the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).”  The nature of this program is to accelerate discoveries related to the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis with particular emphasis on identification of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, better identification of markers of early disease and disease progression, development of more sensitive and specific indices for disease diagnosis and characterization, and identification of potential treatment targets.  Through the development and conduct of these studies, the NIAMS expects to foster collaborations between the broader research community and the OAI investigators.  Results from these investigations should improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis and will be helpful in determination of risk for disease and development of interventions.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has supported collection of blood samples, images, and clinical data from participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) since 2002, which has become part of a large public data base.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NIAMS and the OAI centers. Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a multifaceted, concerted effort that would likely exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of OAI as a whole. The NIAMS and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources. In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important to stimulate the use of these samples and data collected with public funds by the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.  Data and images are currently available through a website (www.oai.ucsf.edu) and images through request at the same link.  The NIAMS seeks to support these investigations through the contract mechanism to ensure open access to the data and tools generated.  The proposals should include sections on how data would be made available to the OAI for inclusion in the OAI database and other open access NIH sources. 

The program objectives are as follows:

1.  Development of tools and resources to maximize public access to and use of the OAI database and image repository.

2.  Development of novel and efficient tools for analysis of MR images and x rays that can be applied to large numbers of images with high degrees of reproducibility for diagnosis and monitoring of OA-related changes.

3.  Identification and validation of risk factors for knee and hip OA including both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

4.  Determination of predictive role of MRI changes for subsequent radiographic and clinical outcome changes related to development of knee OA.
 
5.  Analyses of efficacy of biobehavioral, pharmacological, and 'natural' interventions (including pain meds, over the counter, CAM, aids, vitamins, etc) that subjects use in response to OA pain.  (Based on data already collected from the OAI) 

6.  Research focused on the trajectory of disease including effects on other joint structures such as muscles, ligaments, and bone, with regard to points where interventions could be made, especially for subsets, to reduce OA severity.

It is anticipated that three to five cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for a period of 5 years beginning on or about June 1, 2010. The solicitation will be in the form of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and will be available electronically on or about April 24, 2009 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Proposals will be due on or about July 27, 2009.

Paper copies of this RFQ will not be issued and telephone requests or fax requests for this RFQ will not be accepted. The National Park Service (NPS), Department of the Interior (DOI), is soliciting quotes from archeologist firms having the capability to perform the work described below.  The National Park Service requires a firm, fixed-price service contract to furnish all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of this project to perform a geoarcheological investigation of two trenches of the Resaca de Palo Alto within the Wetland Restoration Project Area, Brownsville, TX.  A map will be provided upon request.  In addition to excavation and description of the two trenches, the contracted geoarcheologist will collect samples of bulk soil from the profile for dating of the feature. At least one sample should come from the Resaca fill, while other samples should come from deeper fill and/or the undisturbed bank sediments. Charcoal encountered in the trench could be used for data (if observed), but since there is potential vertical movement of small items, this should only be attempted with some caution and a reasonable justification for its use. Samples should also be collected for macrobotanical, pollen, diatom, and/or isotope analysis from the channel and bank sediments to determine, if possible, what kind of data might be present for environmental reconstruction.  The data from this project should be presented to the NPS in a format that would be acceptable for submittal to the THC as part of archaeological compliance documentation related to disturbances caused by the Resaca restoration project. In addition to presentation of the basic trench data, the report should feature a reconstruction of the landform development in this area (i.e., the resaca filling, the location of the original bank, the age of sediments, and mid-nineteenth century condition, if possible). The report should also include conclusions regarding the potential impacts that resaca restoration in this area might have.   It is estimated that this project will require up to six weeks in the field, up to three months of write-up and analysis, and as much as six months to complete the technical report depending on the time to process the samples collected. This project should be completed no more than twelve (12) months after the award date.  This project is a lump sum contract and subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965.  A site visit can be scheduled by contacting Rolando Garza, at 956-541-2785, ext. 331.  The magnitude for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR RICHARD HARDING POFF FEDERAL BUILDING MODERNIZATION IN ROANOKE, VA, SOLICITATION NO.: GS-03P-09-CD-C-0061.  This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project.  The Allegheny Service Center in the Mid-Atlantic Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  The project delivery method being used is the Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc).  A Construction Manager as-constructor provides design phase services and construction phase work. GSA intends to award a contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building Modernization in Roanoke, VA, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Design Phase Services are expected to commence upon award of the contract, on or about October 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to commence on or about June 2010.

The Richard H. Poff Federal Office and Courthouse Building in Roanoke, VA is a fourteen story modern structure containing 187,649 usable square feet, 255,700 rentable square feet and 316,369 gross square feet with 75 indoor and 94 surface parking spaces situated on 1.3 acres.  This 14 story building was constructed in 1975 with green tinted glass curtain walls on the north and south elevations and brown brick on the east and west elevations.

The building’s tenant finishes have been modernized by the customer agencies but the aging electrical system, windows, HVAC, fire alarm and precast concrete panels require replacement.  The proposed capital project will correct structural and systems deficiencies in the 34-year old building. A list of sustainable objectives for the Poff project has been developed, including: replacement of all windows; upgrades to existing restroom facilities and other building systems including fire alarms; installation of energy efficient HVAC equipment, lighting and lighting controls; roof replacement; and implementation of photo-voltaic solar cell arrays on the South roof and a green roof above space on the first floor.  Additional work may be added at a later date using separate funding for tenant improvements.  

The guaranteed maximum price for this project is $42,000,000 based on FY10 funding for combined services (Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work).  The North American Industry Classification System Code(s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The project will be designed and constructed in Metric Units of Measure.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step and Source Selection procedures per FAR Part 15.
At the time of contract award, the project will be in the early phases of design.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process.  At any time during or after design phase services, the Contracting Officer may request that CMc provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to convert the Contract to a firm-fixed-price contract at the offered price or as otherwise negotiated by the parties to this Contract, so long as such price is less than or equal to the GMP.  If the parties to this Contract negotiate and establish a firm-fixed-price prior to the exercise of the Construction Phase Work Option, then the Contracting Officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the firm-fixed-price option within 60 calendar days of the establishment of that price.

Design Phase Services include, and are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development documents; review and evaluation of the Architect of Record construction document submissions for constructability; review and evaluation of all Architect of Record cost estimates; reconciliation of all cost estimates; participation in all construction document team meetings; value engineering suggestions; identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documents; consultation during design document production; preliminary project schedule development; identification of long-lead items, independent pricing of design document phase and construction document phase submittals; preliminary cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and, establishment of firm-fixed pricing.  The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the facility, should the Option for Construction Phase Services be awarded.
Construction Phase Work includes, and are not limited to, construction alterations to the building; project scope management; selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors; administration of the construction contract (how much work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract); administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; conducting and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; participation of Alternative Dispute Resolution partnering consultant; coordination of commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures; and, all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable building.
The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA's Construction Manager as-agent; GSA's selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA's building commissioning firm; GSA's security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.
A source selection/greatest value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being approximately equal to price.  

This is an advisory two step procurement process.  In 
Stage 1, offerors will present their price proposals and technical qualifications by submitting the following information: price proposal, bonding certification for the ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, general contractor’s business license, and technical factors consisting of: 1) Experience and Past Performance, 2) Key Personnel Qualifications and Experience, 3) Project Management Plan and 4) Project Specific Knowledge.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  In Stage 2, those Offerors included in the competitive range shall be interviewed.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

A pre-proposal conference providing instructions for the submission of technical and price proposals will be conducted at the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, VA on or about 07/16/09.  The exact date and time of this conference will be contained in the solicitation package.  Please email Ms. Kimberly DeSant at kim.desant@gsa.gov to confirm your attendance.  The solicitation will be available on or about 07/07/09.  Interested parties may download their own copy of these documents.  These documents will be in .pdf format and may be accessed on a World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.fbo.gov .  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this website for the release of any amendments and to download their own copy of any amendments.  This site provides instructions for downloading the amendment file(s).  

Interested Offerors are required to submit bonding certification of their ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, and are required to be licensed general contractors.  Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and six (6) copies of the required technical and price information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors. 

Interested firms must send their submittal, no later than 3:00 PM EST on 08/06/09, to Kimberly DeSant, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Allegheny Service Center (3PK), The Strawbridge Building, 20 North 8th Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19107.  Prior to award of this contract to a large business, an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required in accordance with FAR Part 19, which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: small business concerns (Goal 37%), hubzone small business concerns (Goal 3%), small disadvantaged business concerns (Goal 6%), women-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%), veteran-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%) and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (3%).  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with            FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>Description: F-16 INITIAL PROVISIONING AND SPARES
<p>1.0 SUBJECT:<br />This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of providing F-16 initial provisioning data, spares and support equipment, at all supply and maintenance levels during aircraft production. This is a market survey. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this RFI. In addition, the Government<br />will not pay for any costs associated with participation in demonstrations. Initial responses are due to this RFI by 3 August 2010. This Notice shall remain open and responses accepted until 31August 2011.</p>
<p><br />2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION:<br />This contract is to define, develop, and purchase initial provisioning documentation and recommended initial provisioning spares to support the F-16 aircraft. Provisioning documentation includes predictable and unpredictable data. It secures supplies and data for modification programs, and new systems as they are included on the aircraft. These initial efforts will support the end items at the least cost to the Government until follow-on replenishment spares can be procured.</p>
<p><br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS:<br />The USAF is issuing this request in an effort to identify contractors who are qualified to conduct the following tasks:</p>
<p>3.1<br />Develop a capability to define, develop, and deliver initial provisioning documentation and recommend initial provisioning spares to support the F-16 aircraft. The contractor shall prepare provisioning documentation using the Logistics Support Analysis 036 format (LSA-036) format and delivered to 418 SCMS/GULAAC via the D220 Mechanized Provisioning System, which is the sole initial provisioning archive database for the USAF and our customers. This will require the contractor to be able to establish their database and systems with interface capability with the government systems. The contractor shall compute the recommended spares quantities to initially support the USAF and its customers and include the data in the provisioning documentation.<br /><br />3.2<br />The contractor must have the capability to access the F-16 design history, baseline, or the necessary F-16 engineering data for all aircraft models, in all of the World-wide configurations. The government cannot presently provide that data. Companies responding must describe how they will obtain and/or develop the necessary data. The contractor must be able to utilize this data to develop engineering changes, provide data, and deliver the resulting recommended spares lists required for initial provisioning spares.</p>
<p>4.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE:<br />Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.</p>
<p>4.1 Briefly describe the company, products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information deemed relevant.</p>
<p>4.2 Please describe any projects the company has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.</p>
<p>4.3 A preliminary Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for cost and schedule is requested so that the US Government can better prepare for future expenses. Contract award will not be made based on a ROM submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />5.0 DISCLAIMER:</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), a response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />6.0 CONTACT INFORMATION</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit the aforementioned summary of capabilities and facilities to:<br />Steve Jorgensen<br />448 SCMG/PKAC<br />6021 Gum Lane, Bldg 1228<br />Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825<br />Steven.jorgensen@hill.af.mil</p>

This notice is a Sources Sought announcement only. There is no Solicitation package available at this time.
This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract (see FAR 15.201(e). This Market Research, Request For Information (RFI), and any submitted samples are for M240 LCBA performance analysis and planning purposes only.  Responses shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. The Government will not reimburse respondents for information solicited nor for any samples submitted for testing. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.
Description:The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of PM Crew Served Weapons has a requirement for the fabrication and delivery of M240 Lightweight Collapsible Buttstock Assemblies (LCBA), and associated Spare Parts, for use on the M240 Machine Gun, in accordance with the Government Technical Data Package (TDP), the associated individual drawings,  Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), Specialized Packaging Instructions (SPI) and the Statement of Work (SOW). 
The M240 LCBAs are to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped in accordance with the Government TDP and the Statement of Work (SOW) for this procurement. 
The LCBAs will be deployed on the 7.62MM, M240B Medium Machine Gun. The M240B is a gas operated, air cooled machine gun which fires linked ammunition from the open bolt position and is capable of providing sustained accurate fire in support of infantry operations.
In general, this LCBA consists of various CNC turned/milled (up to 5-axis may be necessary) billet aluminum and steel parts, a die cast aluminum part, an injection molded plastic part, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) fasteners, an impact mitigation system as well as formed spring steel components.  Tolerances of the parts can be held as tightly as 1/1000 of an inch. Many of the parts are heat treated and then have a final protective finish (e.g. phosphate/anodize) conforming to various military standards.  After fabrication the parts then are to be assembled to produce the buttstock assembly. Assembly may include pressing pins and bushings into place, flaring ends of fasteners and applying proper torque to screws after the addition of thread locking adhesives.  The assembled unit weight is approximately 2.3 pounds.  Inspection of these parts is to conform to various military standards and drawings and may require coordinate measuring machines, optical comparators, etc.  The contractor would need to at minimum be capable of performing the above tasks in-house or be proficient in subcontracting the tasks out to qualified vendors. 
To obtain a copy of the TDP, AFTER the Solicitation package is released, interested contractors must mail/email, to the POC listed below, a signed and approved DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement along with a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Questionnaire (with all appropriate supporting AMSTA-AR Form 1350 supporting documentation) and a completed and signed U.S. Government Non-Disclosure / Non-Use Agreement.
The TDP will be supplied on a CD ROM disc and will be an Exhibit with the Solicitation package. It will be marked with a Distribution D restrictive marking which limits distribution to US based Department of Defense (DoD) contractors only. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22. U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979(Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), as amended. Violators of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.
The Request for Proposal (RFP) anticipated release on or about 30 July 2010 will result in award of a Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Contract with five one year ordering periods. The Government may elect to award multiple IDIQ contracts with each order placed via the Fair Opportunity process.  The maximum program ordering quantity is 70,000 each, M240 LCBS Assemblies plus associated Spare Parts, plus First Article Test quantities. The minimum program ordering quantity will be 13,500 each M240 LCBAs, if multiple contracts are made or 27,000 each M240 LCBAs if one contract is made.  In addition, First Article Test quantities, as required, must be furnished as well.  Proposals will be required within thirty (30) days after release of the solicitation. 
A First Article Test (FAT) is required for ten (10) M240 LCBA, five (5) assembled and five (5) disassembled; one hundred eighty (180) days after contract award. Production deliveries, plus associated Spare Parts, will commence forty-five (45) days after contractor receipt of written Government approval of the First Article Test.

<p>It is the responsibility of any interested offeror to ensure electronic responses are received. BPD assumes no responsibility for the receipt of email.</p>
<p>The responses received to this RFI will assist the government in determining the most proper acquisition strategy and the proper set-aside preference group, if any, which promises the greatest chance of fair competition. It is not guaranteed that any solicitation will be issued.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this requirement will be provided at this time.</p>
<p><strong>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT<br /><br /></strong>The services desired by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) involve modeling the behavior of large vapor clouds before and after ignition, blast effects, fire behavior in large facilities, and overpressure isobar mapping.</p>
<p>Each respondent to the RFI wishing to be considered for inclusion in any solicitation must provide the following information at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. Detailed, written qualifications for each individual (curriculum vitae or equivalent) proposed to perform and oversee the blast effects and fire behavior services. The contractor must have extensive experience with blast effects, blast modeling, fire science, fire behavior, fire behavior modeling, and the tools (i.e., computer models) suitable for performing the scope of work. They should have extensive experience with fire and explosions involving vapor clouds, flammable gases, liquids, and combustible dusts.</p>
<p>2. A narrative description of prior work history by the contractor that is similar to the work described in the general statement of requirements and services sections below. If subcontractors are proposed for any portion of the work, the prior work history MUST include demonstration of past performance by the proposed subcontractor(s) as well. The CSB wishes to emphasize that mere lists of previous clients are not considered demonstrations of past work, and that the expectation of fulfillment of this requirement is a paragraph or more describing actual project experience that is very similar or identical in nature to the work required here.</p>
<p>3. Detailed description of the model or models possessed by the contractor for fulfilling the tasks listed below.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />On October 23, 2009, a vapor cloud explosion and subsequent fires occurred at the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation fuel depot at the Luchetti Industrial Park in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. The company receives and distributes bulk fuel products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Minor injuries occurred, but the tank farm was nearly completely destroyed. Extensive offsite damage occurred including hundreds of broken windows, interior damage, and mild structural steel deformation.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to obtain the services of a contractor to examine field data collected by the CSB, including pictures and videos of the incident scene and surrounding community, for blast damage markers; model the spread of vapor throughout the site based on release scenarios, and topographic and meteorologic data; calculate the overpressures required to produce the observed damage; and perform blast modeling for various scenarios to establish the likely magnitude and source of the blast(s). In addition, the contractor shall perform fire behavior modeling to understand the rapid spread of fire through the site.</p>
<p><strong>SERVICES:<br /></strong><br />Task 1:<br />Using information from the CSB's survey, evaluate the blast impacted area in and around the facility to identify blast damage markers to reconstruct key blast characteristics. The CSB's survey documented the severity of damage to and the location and orientation of homes, business, and other structures in the area by means of photography and written diagrams and/or notes. <br /><br />Task 2:<br />Perform structural analysis with blast load indicators to determine the incident overpressure.</p>
<p>Task 3:<br />Using appropriate computer-based tools, model the behavior and spread of the vapor cloud using multiple release scenarios.</p>
<p>Task 4:<br />Perform the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Calculate or otherwise estimate the overpressures, and other explosion characteristics, required to cause the observed damage.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop overpressure isobar map for the area of the incident.</p>
<p>&bull; Use appropriate computer software to evaluate various explosion scenarios to account for the observed damage and calculated overpressures.</p>
<p>Task 5<br />Using video and photographic evidence, contractor shall evaluate and model the fire behavior and fire propagation during the incident following the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /></strong><br />The period of performance is expected to be for one (1) year and will be specified at award.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /></strong><br />Confidentiality: If this RFI results in the issuance of a solicitation and award of a contract, the selected contractor, and its personnel assigned to the contract, will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement to ensure the protection of trade secrets, confidential business information, and sensitive investigative information. The contractor will also be required to ensure that any subcontractors supporting the contract execute equivalent non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Conflicts of Interest: If this RFI results in the issuance of a solicitation and award of a contract, the selected contractor will be required to agree to a set of CSB-specific supplemental contract terms. These terms include, among other provisions, the following conflicts of interest clause:<br />Organizational Conflicts of Interest<br />a. Contractor, its personnel, and any other person or entity performing work for Contractor on behalf of the CSB, shall execute a certification of non-conflict of interest. Such executed certification constitutes the signatory's acknowledgement that he has read and understood the requirements of this clause and agrees to abide by its terms.<br />b. Contractor and its personnel performing work for the CSB under this contract should not be placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (whether financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise), which relate to the work performed under this contract, nor should Contractor obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance under this contract.<br />c. Contractor warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or in the alternative, warrants that it has fully disclosed all such relevant information. Additionally, during the term of this contract, Contractor agrees to forego entering into any other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization, the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. Contractor shall ensure that all agents, employees, and subcontractors retained for any purpose under this contract abide by the provisions of this entire clause. If Contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any of its agents, employees, or subcontractors, that any proposed contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB before the execution of such contractual arrangement.<br />d. Contractor further agrees that if, after it commences work for the CSB, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB. It is agreed that this disclosure will include a description of the action that Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate the conflicts. Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary and/or supplemental action to be taken.<br />e. It is the specific responsibility of Contractor to ensure that any and all subcontractors, and any subcontractors' employees, are free from conflicts of interest. Contractor warrants that no subcontractors already identified, or any of their subcontractors' employees, have an identifiable conflict of interest. It is further agreed that, in the event a conflict of interest is discovered after award of the subcontract, the same rules for disclosure, and all of the same remedies open to the CSB, described below, remain binding. Contractor further agrees to insert in each subcontract or agreement done in furtherance of this contract, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this entire clause.<br />f. During the period of performance under this contract, Contractor specifically agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for Caribbean Petroleum Corporation; or for Caribbean Petroleum's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the October 23, 2009, explosion and fires); or for any other entity or individual that is the subject of an open CSB investigation. Contractor also agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for Caribbean Petroleum Corporation; or Caribbean Petroleum's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the October 23, 2009, explosion and fires), for a period of 6 months after final completion of the contracted services rendered to the CSB. Additionally, if Contractor performs work for the CSB under contract at the site of an official CSB investigation, Contractor agrees not to solicit work at that site from the entity or individual being investigated for a period of 6 months after the issuance of the final CSB report on that investigation.<br />g. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing prohibitions, the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB may authorize Contractor to solicit or perform this general type of work if the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel determine that the situation will not pose a potential for bias or unfair competitive advantage, and that the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB approve of the proposed solicitation or work.<br />h. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant conflicts of interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract, or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the CSB may terminate the contract for default, disqualify Contractor from subsequent contracts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract. Notwithstanding these remedies, however, the CSB may always terminate the contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if termination is in the best interests of the government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Landmark Event Memory Error Survey
<SOLNBR>YA1323-10-PB-0615
<RESPDATE>070110
<CONTACT>Paul W Boesch, Email paul.w.boesch@census.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The Census Bureau is conducting market research to identify available sources for the proposed services below:
<p>1.	Background and Purpose of the Task<br /> <br />The Census Bureau sometimes collects data that are dependent on respondents having accurate knowledge of the date when major events happened in their lives and the lives of others in their household.  For example, for an accurate census, respondents must know where they and others in their household were living on April 1st.   To create an accurate household roster for the census, the respondent has to recall any move dates, birth or death dates for members of their household.  In the American Community Survey, respondents are asked to report the month and year they moved into their home.  If they were not born in the U.S., respondents are asked for the year they came to live in the United States.  In testing of the 2007 event history calendar for the Survey of Income and Program Participation, respondents are asked to date events in their lives or in the lives of people important to them within the past year.  In the text read to respondents, examples of such important events are births or deaths, marriages, divorces, or separations, promotions, serious injury or illnesses.</p>
<p>A research project is being planned to evaluate the memory error associated with recalling calendar dates of different landmark events in a person's life in an effort to assess the quality of the responses to the questions.  Information is needed about the validity of the assumption that respondents can remember the dates of these landmark events accurately, at least within a 12 month window.   The primary goal of this project is to determine how accurately respondents can recall the calendar date of landmark events such as household moves and immigration, for both themselves and others in their household.  Other landmark events such as births, deaths, marital status, and job changes are of secondary focus.  We want to know how memory error for these events is affected by the lag in time between the event and the recalling of the date.  We want to know how memory error for these events is affected by self or proxy reporting.  We want to know the amount of over or under reporting and the direction of any memory error associated with dates of landmark events for different lag times.  We want to know if there are any cues the survey designer can provide to improve memory for such events.  Finally, we want to know any other characteristics of the date, respondent, or situation that affects memory error.</p>
<p>This research effort is dependent on the existence of a current survey vehicle with known respondents who have moved or immigrated recently (within the past year (for movers) up to five years ago (for immigrants)).  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if there is a current survey that collects data on the population of interest and, if so, what is the sample and operational design.  If a survey exists that collects the required information, then the Census Bureau would seek the services of a contractor to assist the Census Bureau in conducting this research.</p>
<p>2.	Task Requirements</p>
<p>We are seeking information about contractor capabilities to conduct this research, such as an available database that contains collected information about landmark events.  Our initial thoughts on how to measure memory error for these landmark events is to conduct a repeated measures design with known movers and immigrants.  Interested contractors shall also provide a brief summary of its responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1.	Is it possible to use survey vehicles currently in existence with known respondents who have moved or immigrated recently (within the past year (for movers) up to five years ago (for immigrants))?<br />2.	Does the frame contain both whole households of movers in addition to households where only some of the individuals have moved in or out?  Likewise for immigrants.<br />3.	For these surveys, how is truth of the mover or immigration status measured?<br />4.	At what level is the move or immigration date known: year only, month/year only, or day/month/year?<br />5.	How would "truth" for marital status, births, deaths, and job changes be measured?<br />6.	Is there the ability to study self and proxy reporting with these vehicles for the data of interest?<br />7.	What are the response rates, attrition rates, and biases associated with the frames?<br />8.	Is there ability to have a repeated measures design with these vehicles?<br />9.	What are the costs and other limitations associated with such research using the vehicle described?<br />10.	What are your suggestions for other ways to study memory error associated with landmark events which have happened in the past 12 months to 5 years?<br />11.	Are there any frames for which there are known dates of other landmark events which we could study?</p>
<p>The contractor would collaborate with Census Bureau staff to determine the question wording.  The Contractor would provide the survey instrument, frame, training, equipment, and support to collect the data of interest.  At the conclusion of data collection, the Contractor would make recommendations about how to ask questions that require the respondent to remember dates of landmark events.  In addition, the Contractor would provide the reported data to the Census Bureau in an agreed upon format.  The Contractor would provide any additional information needed for Census Bureau staff to conduct analyses with the data appropriately.  The Contractor would communicate and coordinate with the Census Bureau on all aspects.  <br /><br />The government anticipates the services will be obtained through a firm fixed price contract for a total duration of 12 months.<br /><br />Interested individuals capable of doing this type of work must submit their capabilities statements and responses to the provided questions, and DUNS number via electronic submission at paul.w.boesch@census.gov no later than 12:00pm (EST), July 1, 2010. No information will be taken by telephone or mail. Any questions regarding this request should be directed to Paul Boesch, email: paul.w.boesch@census.gov. <br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government. The purpose of this notice is to identify qualified sources.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, has a requirement for new voice and data lines to be wired to the new expansion space at Montana State University (MSU).  The wiring has to be routed to MSU's existing trunk, which connects at the MSU Renne Library basement.  For continuity of operations, MSU phone numbers are to be assigned to all new offices.  The new voice system must be identical to the system in place in the existing space that the Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center currently occupies at MSU.  The system is required to be set up per the GSA schematics since the new expansion space is within a GSA-leased building.
Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253, implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the commercial items and services specified as a sole source from the Montana State University, 901 Garfield St, Bozeman, MT 59717-0001 and proposes to negotiate with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-response to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business June 18, 2010 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified Contractors.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541712, Research Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  The Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees.<BR><BR>The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) is seeking businesses to provide services to further the understanding of Perchlorate Destruction and Potable Water Production Using Membrane Biofilm Reduction and Membrane Filtration.   Aligned with this purpose, the main objective of this project is to demonstrate and validate that a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) coupled with downstream ultrafiltration (UF) is capable of destroying nitrate and perchlorate in extracted groundwater as well as producing water that is potable. Specific technical objectives include demonstrating that (1) nitrate and perchlorate concentrations consistently can be reduced to analytical method reporting limits at a flow rate of 25 gallons per minute; (2) biofilm growth and chemical scaling of the MBfR and UF fibers is controllable, stable, and does not require unusual maintenance requirements; (3) produced water meets California Department of Health Services and U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act chemistry requirements for potable water and other relevant requirements such as maximum tolerable dissolved organic carbon; (4) produced water does not contain sulfide or objectionable taste/odor; and (5) system is responsive to possible operational upsets, normal maintenance procedures, and normal temporal variations in water quality.  The results to date demonstrate that primary variables that were determined to affect MBfR performance were feed flow rate and the MBfR module recirculation rate, and that drinking water parameters were determined to be within Safe Drinking Water Act limits.  It has been determined that a continuation of the study is needed to further develop the technique at a different demonstration site.  <BR><BR>This market survey/sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey/sources sought.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 1:00pm 30 June 2010.  Responses can be submitted to US Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineering Center Support Activity, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315 or e-mail to Lisa.L.Kurtz@usace.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>1. Industry Day is scheduled for an upcoming BAA on Wednesday, 30 June 2010. This BAA will include three (3) topics:
<p>A. <strong>Green Advanced Spacecraft Propulsion (Green ASP)</strong> - AFRL's object of this program is to develop a thruster that will accommodate increased temperature and oxidation product environments to deliver predictable performance. Associated life and delivered thrust scaling as well as degradation algorithms are sought to support predictability of performance. AFRL is pursuing increased delivered energy density, decreased toxicity spacecraft chemical propulsion to support development and deployment of smaller logistical footprint, more easily deployable and mission capable spacecraft. AFRL has developed increased energy density, decreased toxicity monopropellant formulations relative to the current state of the art; however, the combustion environments are more demanding than state of the art propellants due to the increase in combustion temperature and oxidative product formation. Correspondingly, thruster component temperature and oxidation resistance requirements have increased relative to the state of the art as well. Thruster development to date, specific to AFRL developed advanced monopropellant formulations, has emphasized catalytic ignition. Development work has been focused upon a specific AFRL-developed monopropellant formulation applied to thruster design and support system (tanks, valves, regulators, control components, etc.) primarily for satellite missions. The desired conclusion of this program is a relevant demonstration of flight-like optimized components and of relevant mission duty cycles that support a flight-weight propulsion system design with defined performance and lifetime attributes. To achieve this end, the program design will rely on a phased approach 1) to understand thruster component materials requirements defined by combustion environment, degradation behavior, etc., and initialize algorithms describing these, 2) to map out delivered performance in a basic thruster configuration and derive initial scaling and degradition algorithms there from, 3) to optimize light-weight thruster development, to test performance and to validate developed algorithms, 4) and to demonstrate program performance goals and design for a proto-flight propulsion unit with supporting data analysis.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Health Assessment and Recognition Tools (HART)</strong> - The purpose of this topic is to solicit proposals for the development of innovative technologies in the field of liquid rocket engine health management. More specifically, the purpose of this topic is to develop sensors and sensor data algorithms that will enable oxygen-rich staged-combustion cycle reusable booster engines to achieve the Air Force operability goal for engine turnaround time. Solutions of particular interest include those that reduce or eliminate time-consuming ground inspections and/or maintenance actions. This topic has two (2) areas of interest; Turbopump Assembly (TPA) Application and Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA) Application.</p>
<p><br />C. <strong>Propulsion Unit for Cubesats (PUC)</strong> - Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB is interested in developing a propulsion module for precision maneuvering of very small spacecraft. Spacecraft typified by the emerging "cubesat" standard may provide a new paradigm for responsive spacecraft. Spacecraft with stowed volumes of between 1,000 cm3 and 3,000 cm3 massing approximately 3 kg for a variety of missions are advantageous for a variety of Air Force missions. One significant drawback of present cubesat technology is the lack of capable primary propulsion. Recent analysis performed at AFRL has determined that it is possible to increase total impulse capability dramatically over current state-of-the-art while remaining within a 1,000 cm3 envelope. Technologies of interest include both low and high thrust propulsion technologies.</p>
<p>2. Industry Day will be held in Bldg 8351, Room 230 at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Edwards AFB, CA. RSVP is required by COB Friday, 25 June 2010 to Katy Day via e-mail (Kathrin.day@edwards.af.mil). In your RSVP, you must include an approved copy of your company's Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, DD Form 2345. Otherwise, you will not be granted admission to the Industry Day. Additionally, standard visit authorization requests (VARs) must be submitted for each visitor to enable access to AFRL. VARs can be faxed or submitted via JPAS (insert JPAS code info-get from security). Point of contact (POC) to coordinate VARs are James Singleton (james.singleton@edwards.af.mil) for topics 1 and 3, and Jeremy Andrews (jermey.andrews@edwards.af.mil) for topic 2. All VARs provided via fax must be signed by your organization's cognizant security officer and include their contact information. Access to AFRL will be granted for U.S. citizens only.</p>
<p>3. Tentative Industry Day Agenda:</p>
<p>0730-0800 Arrival/Security Check through gate<br />0800-0830 Opening Remarks<br />0830-0900 Business Information Briefing<br />0900-1030 Technical Information Briefings<br />1100-1630 Individual Q&amp;A Sessions</p>
<p>4. Individual Q&amp;A Sessions will be limited to 30 minutes per company. Q&amp;A sessions are available and will be reserved on a first-RSVP basis. Only one (1) Q&amp;A session will be allowed per company. If a company cannot attend Industry Day, the Air Force reserves the right to schedule a one-on-one telecom in lieu of an on-site Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>5. A map of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB, CA is provided for reference.</p>
<p>6. A DRAFT BAA will be added to this announcement prior to Industry Day that includes all three topics.</p>

<p><strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong></p>
<p>Safety &amp; Occupational Health is conducting market research for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Occupational Health Recordkeeping in order to streamline our work processes, recordkeeping, and assist the Health Unit staff in daily work operations. Our staff consists of two (2) Health Units, three (3) nurses, and two (2) office assistants. Our Health Units serve approximately 2,000 employees total. The system needs to be "occupational health" based, and must be able to be used in an occupational health unit setting (i.e., we don't need a large scale system like a doctor's office or hospital may have). Our needs include accurate recordkeeping for medical documentation, wellness programs, storage of medical documentation, and research capabilities.</p>
<p>The system must be able to "build-in" some of the current forms we use such as the following: emergency medical information, physical exam information, nurses notes, progress notes, pre-employment physicals, vision and hearing information, pulmonary information, vaccine releases, and urine and glucose information. The system must be able to be tailored to meet all Safety &amp; Occupational Health's needs.</p>
<p>The system must be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.</p>
<p>The system must be Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 140-2 compliant.</p>
<p>RFI Specifics</p>
<p>An adequate response to this RFI would include the following items:</p>
<p>&bull; A proposed product to provide the capabilities described above; and<br />&bull; A general cost associated with the product or service.</p>
<p>Additionally please provide the name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.) based on NAICS Code 519190, size standard $7.0m. Contact information shall include the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company has recently (within the last 3 years) provided these, or similar, services for. Include a point of contact information for the companies listed.</p>
<p>Contractors should provide their DUNS, if applicable.<br />No other information regarding this RFI will be provided at this time. <br />This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All contractors responding to this sources sought notice are advised that the response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>Responses to this request must be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on June 29, 2010 and may be submitted electronically to PSB2@bpd.treas.gov to the attention of Jacob Oberlin.</p>

<DESC>Blood and Blood Components 
*SPECIAL NOTICE*

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10 Dayton Contract office intends make a sole source award to Community Blood Center of Dayton Ohio, for the purchase of a three (3) month of Blood and Blood Components Services bridge contract. The Statutory authority for this sole source purchase is Title 10 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2) as implemented in the FAR 6.302-2 (a)(2). The applicable NAICS Code is 621991 with a size standard of $10 million dollars. A Justification and Approval to procure using other than full and open competition is below and a VA Form 2268 is on file in the Contracting Office. Any interested parties, other than Community Blood Center are encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer at the e-mail address below no later than June 21, 2010 at 2:00 PM EST to inquire about other related upcoming procurement opportunities. All interested parties, must be registered in Central Contracting Registration (CCR) database. This notice is for informational purposes only. ***No response to this special notice is necessary*** Questions may be directed to Monae D. Heath, Contracting Officer via e-mail at Monae.Heath@va.gov. 


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) - ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AND NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS &
41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2) - UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY

CONTRACTOR: COMMUNITY BLOOD CENTER


1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: Network 10, "Dayton VA Medical Center (DVAMC)" as requested by VA Ohio Healthcare System, will enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved: Contractor shall provide all necessary labor, management, supervision, technical skills, quality control, materials, tools, transportation, equipment to provide blood and blood components to the DVAMC.

3. Description of Requirement: VA Ohio Healthcare System is requesting sole source bridge contract with "Contractor" to provide Blood and Blood Components to the DVAMC. The estimated cost is $102,000 for three (3) months of services
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) & (2), FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) (2).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This contract is being procured on a sole source basis due to "Contractor" being the only source from which DVAMC can procure blood and blood components. They are the only community blood center in Dayton. 

We need a bridge put into place until a one year contract can be securedCBC offers blood components both leukocyte reduced and non-leukocyte reduced components that are needed for patient care. Only 30% of blood centers continue to offer both products.  

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.   

This procurement will be synopsized as an intent to sole source. One-year blood contracts have previously been awarded to CBC as sole source contracts. They were also synopsized as intents to sole source and no interested parties were identified.  Because the CBC will not offer pricing for more than one year, there is never an option to award a contract with option years.

7. Anticipated Cost: It is in the best interest of the government to use this contractor.  CBC's red blood cell component fees are below market rates. The Price is in line with pricing provided to the vendor's other commercial customers, and is considered to be fair and reasonable. 

8. Results of Market Survey:  CBC turn-around time in providing blood and blood product is minimal.  CBC is only 15 to 30 minutes away in the case of an "emergency" compared to other suppliers 1.5 to 2 hours away. The time it would take to procure blood from other providers who are not local would have a drastic impace on patient care and could be life threatening. It has also been determined that CBC offers blood components both leukocyte reduced and non-leukocyte reduced red blood cells that are needed for patient care at a reasonable rate.  Only 30% of blood centers continue to offer both products.  

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.  

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: Not Applicable - see item 6

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONMay 14, 2010
For Crown Tour Pass Reservation, Sales and Issuance ServicesAt Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island
As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.3, authority is herein requested to contract on a sole source basis for tour pass reservation, sales and issuance services to be provided for Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island in support of National Park Service visitor services. In accordance with 41 U.S.C.  253(c), this justification is submitted to request award of a contract to Statue Cruises, LLC of Jersey City, NJ, for crown tour pass reservation, sales and issuance services.
As specified by FAR 6.303-2, Content, the following are the facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.
(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than Full and Open Competition."
The agency is the U.S. Department of the Interior acting through the National Park Service, Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island (Park).  The Contracting activity is the National Park Service WASO-WCP.  This document is a Justification for other than Full and Open Competition.
(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
Procurement of tour pass reservation, sales and issuance services to support visitor services provided by the Park.

(3) Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).
The contractor will provide, staff and operate a computerized reservation, sales and issuance system for Park crown tour passes.  The estimated cost for this requirement is estimated to be $xxx,xxx over a five-year term.
(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1)).
(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
The tour pass reservation, sales and issuance services required by the Park can only be provided by the proposed contractor, Statue Cruises, LLC (SC), since they alone are able to meet the system requirements to fulfill the Park Service's need and they are the only source currently authorized to sell ferry tickets.
The scope of services for the proposed contract states that the contractor shall provide, staff and operate a computerized reservation, sales and issuance system for crown tour passes at the Park with the following system requirements: 
System Requirement1. Integrated with reservation, sales and issuance of ferry tickets, pedestal tour passes, and audio tours.
Purpose of Requirement #1	A.  Crown tour passes cannot be used by Park visitors unless they also have a ferry ticket to reach the Park.B.  Crown tour passes must be tied to timed ferry departures to disperse the passes throughout each day - this is a critical Park management requirement.C.  Park management requires that all visitation access to Park resources and programs be coordinated to allow effective oversight.
System Requirements2. Crown tour passes are issued on the same printed ticket as ferry tickets, pedestal tour passes and audio tours.	
Purpose of Requirement #2Prevent visitor confusion over multiple tickets, accidental loss of redundant tickets, and litter from multiple discarded tickets.
System Requirements 3.  Available in multiple languages.	4. Available on the Internet 24 hours every day of the year.	5. Accept online payment by Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discovery credit card.	6. Available by telephone every day of the year except Christmas from at least 8:00am to 7:00pm Eastern Time.	7. Available in-person at ticket counters located at all ferry embarkation sites every day of the year except Christmas from at least one hour before to one-half hour after ferry sailings.
Purpose of Requirements #3-7Assure broadest possible visitor access to limited crown access passes.
System Requirements	8. Passes are issued only at ferry embarkation site will-call windows.	9. Passes are issued only after confirming reserving parties' photo identifications and credit cards (for online purchases).	10. Reservations are limited to four passes per party.	11. Pass inventory is carefully tracked and managed.
Purpose of Requirements #8-11Prevent unauthorized use or third-party re-sale of passes.
System Requirement	12. Provide complete, transparent and auditable accounting records for all pass sales.	
Purpose of Requirement #12Facilitate oversight by Park and prevent fraud.
System Requirement13. Pass-through receipts from the sale of crown tour passes to the National Park Service on a monthly basis.	
Purpose of Requirement #13Facilitate accounting and use of revenues from passes by Park.

It is imperative that Crown tour passes and ferry tickets are  reserved, sold and issued in conjunction one with another for the following reasons:
1. See system requirement 1 above. The proposed contractor is the Park's ferry concessioner.  They currently provide, staff and operate a computerized reservation, sales and issuance system for ferry tickets, pedestal tour passes, and audio tours under Concession Contract CC-STLI001-07.  This contract began on April 1, 2008, and will expire on March 31, 2018.  No other party has access to the concessioner's proprietary system and, therefore, no other party can integrate the reservation, sales and issuance of crown tour passes with the concessioner's proprietary system.
2.  See system requirement 1 above. If another party were to provide the required services for issuance of crown passes without integration in the ferry ticket reservation system, visitor access to the crown would be compromised.  Currently, and with no change anticipated, all visitor access to Liberty Island is provided by the ferry concessioner.  During peak season, ferries are completely sold out early each day through a combination of advance reservations and walk-up sales.  In addition, due to the high demand for Crown tour passes, they are typically reserved and sold out three to five months in advance.  Unless these two events are handled by a single contractor, there is a high probability of a visitor being able to get a ferry ticket and not a pass to tour the Crown or obtaining a pass to tour the Crown with no way of getting there.  This would completely undermine the management objective of the Park.  
3.  See system requirement 1 above. Unless crown tour passes are tied to timed ferry departures, demands for access to the Liberty Island security screening facilities and the crown would be uncontrolled and concentrated at the most popular times of the day. This would create an unmanageable situation for the Park.
4.  See system requirements 1 and 2 above. The Park's mission is, in large part, to provide for the enjoyment of its resources by visitors.  If crown tour passes are not coordinated with other Park access and program reservations and sales, visitors would have to use multiple Internet sites, telephone call centers, and walk-up windows representing different Park services. This would cause unacceptable redundancy and confusion for visitors and make it more difficult for visitors to find all the information they need to maximize their Park experience. The only effective way to provide for and manage visitor access to Park resources is through a unified system.

(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
A notice of intent to award a sole source contract will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2. 
(7) A determination by the contacting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
It is anticipated that the basis for determining fair and reasonable pricing will be to compare it to the independent government estimate and a comparison to similar services. 
(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
Market research was not conducted because the required services are unique (a portion of a larger computerized reservation, sales and issuance system) and no comparable services are available.
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
-  Since the proposed contractor already has a system in place there would be no start-up costs.  This would be a savings to the government estimated at $26,000.  
- In addition to start up costs, the proposed contractor already has the system in place to provide both the ferry tickets and crown passes, this eliminates any redundant coordination efforts resulting in cost savings since reservations, sales, and issuance services are handled by a single contractor.  
-  Only the proposed contractor currently has a system in place that has been tested and proved to be successful.
-  The ferry ticket and the crown pass are separate tickets yet they compliment each other.  In essence, since the two tickets are so linked in purpose it would be unrealistic to request visitors to go to two separate ticket windows to reserve and pick up their tickets.  This situation would be comparable to if an airline company required the passenger to check their luggage through a completely different company.  

(10)  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
No sources have expressed, in writing, an interest in this acquisition.
(11)  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
Increased competition for this requirement is not possible as long as access to the Park is provided by the ferry concessioner and access to the crown is limited. Since this is the case, there is a management need to integrate the ferry ticket and crown tour pass reservation, sales and issuance systems. 
(12)  Contracting Officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.
As the approving Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<RESPDATE>063010

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three (3) overlapping ranges of coverage - the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range - with five (5) Compensated Ion Chamber (CIC) neutron detectors covering all of the Intermediate Range and Power Range in five (5) separate nuclear instrument channels. The neutron detectors for each of these channels are suspended in "dry wells" (Attachment 1) in the biological shield that partially shield them from undesired gamma radiation and allow for removal for servicing or replacement, and for vertical positioning adjustments. The detector wells are vertical metal pipes outside the reactor vessel (containing the fuel core, moderator and cooling water). The pipes are set in concrete and lead shielding.</p>
<p>Over time, the wells have developed constrictions that reduce the interior diameter. These diameter changes cause physical drag and binding and now restrict the ability to place existing CIC detectors in their correct positions. During the past 40 years, detectors were normally removed from their wells only for repair or replacement. Now, to monitor future loss of well diameter, it may be necessary to have to pull each detector out annually of which will greatly increase the risk of damage to the detectors and attached cables.</p>
<p>CURRENT OPERATION</p>
<p>Each of the existing CIC Neutron Detector Assemblies (of which are lowered into each detector well) consist of the following components:</p>
<p>1. The CIC neutron detector itself. Westinghouse WL-8074 or equivalent, with three male type HN coaxial connectors on one end. See Attachment 2.</p>
<p>2. Polyethlene insulating spacers separating the detector and cable connectors from the outer can. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>3. A protective outer can 3.5 inches in diameter and 31 inches long, with a 3/4-inch inside diameter lifting eye attached. The can is made of type 6061-T6 aluminum and the lifting eye is made of type 316 stainless steel. See Attachment 3.</p>
<p>4. Three radiation- and heat-resistant mineral-insulated coaxial extension cables 7 feet long. See Attachment 4. Before use in the reactor, each MI cable is wrapped with fiberglass insulating tape over its entire length.</p>
<p>5. A different insulating spacer (Attachment 5) carrying three female-to-female type HN coaxial cable bulkhead connectors (part UG-1019/U), used for the transition from the mineral-insulated cables to the conventional flexible coaxial signal and power cables installed from the reactor top to the control room. The control room cables are terminated with female type BNC connectors at the reactor top, and adapted to the female type HN connectors with part UG-309/U with short BNC-BNC cables between.</p>
<p>6. A lifting cable of 1/8-inch 7x7 Stainless Steel Aircraft Cable.</p>
<p>While the lifting cable supports the weight of each detector assembly, there is no provision for support of the attached mineral-insulated cables nor for their corresponding conventional coaxial signal and power cables. The unsupported mineral-insulated cables, especially, are prone to mechanical damage and electrical failure upon every insertion, height adjustment and removal.</p>
<p>The CIC neutron detectors currently used are electrically connected to their cylindrical outer metal enclosure. The detector well walls are metal. The detectors generate spurious signals whenever the detector enclosure, or a coaxial cable outer conductor make contact with the well walls. The protective outer can, with the included insulating spacers, electrically insulates the detector itself and protects it from mechanical damage, and provides the lifting point for insertion, positioning and suspension of the detector assembly.</p>
<p>The mineral-insulated cables are far more resistant to the radiation and heat damage that occurs in conventional coaxial cables. In the present installation, three (3) MI cables connect each detector to the cables from the control room, one (1) each for High Voltage into the detector, Compensating Voltage into the detector and the detector current signal into the control room electronics.</p>
<p>Attachment 3 depicts the final neutron detector arrangement, incorporating a final assembly of the separate components: the compensated ion chamber; fiberglass-wrapped mineral-insulated cables; polyethylene insulating spacers; protective housing; and lifting eye. This assembly is roughly 3.5 inches in overall diameter, and, with the MI cables, is approximately ten (10) feet long. The detector and protective housing itself is approximately 32 inches long overall.</p>
<p>The detector wells (Attachments 6 and 7) are all approximately 23 feet deep, and they are closed, when in operation, with a five-foot long steel plug. Two (2) of the wells execute an 11-degree bend 12 feet down from the top of the well. This well design places two (2) more constraints on the assembled neutron detectors: (a) the overall length, including attached mineral-insulated cables, may not exceed ten (10) feet; and (b) the length of the rigid (detector/enclosure) portion may not exceed 48 inches.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>NCNR requires seven (7) Compensated Ion Chamber Neutron Detector Assemblies meeting or exceeding the electrical and mechanical performance of the currently-installed detector assemblies.</p>

<p>This requirement is being competed among Microsoft-authorized resellers/business partners.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) currently owns and uses Microsoft Project as an important part of its project management approach. In order to more fully utilize the capabilities of the existing installed base of Microsoft Project, the OCIO plans to procure and implement Microsoft Project Server and also procure 30 additional copies of Microsoft Project Professional software for OCIO staff that have project management duties and need this software.</p>
<p>This requirement consists of the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):<br />CLIN 0001<br />Part # H30-00174<br />MS Project Professional 2010 w/Software Assurance<br />Qty: 30; Unit: EA</p>
<p>CLIN 0002<br />Part # H22-00347<br />MS Project Server 2010 w/Software Assurance<br />Qty: 3; Unit: EA</p>
<p>CLIN 0003<br />Part # H21-03071<br />MS Project Server 2010 User CAL <br />Qty: 100; Unit: EA</p>
<p><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />OCIO already owns Microsoft Project software. Microsoft Project Server is the only project management server solution that works with Microsoft Project software. Therefore, other project management server solutions would not be compatible with the software that already exists in the OCIO environment. Implementing a different project management server solution would require purchasing an entirely new project management software solution and replacing all existing Project software. This would result in spending a significant amount of money on the new software, as well as spending additional money and time training OCIO staff on the new solution. <br /><br />All responsible offerors that are Microsoft-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (a) below replaces paragraph (a) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(a) Submission of quotations.

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-72 ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUIREMENTS (AIR) - GROWTH WORK (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule. <br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses. <br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>Alternate I (Apr 2002) Offerors shall include a copy of this provision with their offer.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.(Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />1. Factor 1- Technical Capability (shall conform to all form, fit and function requirements).<br />2. Factor 2- Price<br />3. Factor 3- Delivery<br />4. Factor 4- Past Performance (based on reference checks and/or historical performance record(s).<br />Technical Capability is the most important evaluation factor. Price is the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery is the third most important evaluation factor. Past Performance is the least important evaluation factor. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Contractor Central Registration database </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">is recommended.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES</p>
<p>In accordance with procedures set forth in AFI 31-101_MWSUP 1 Oct 08:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Normal Installation Entry. Entry to MAFB requires possession and verification of approved identification credentials. Personnel without valid identification will be referred to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) located at the 2nd Avenue North Gate entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People who cannot be properly identified or sponsored will be denied entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Contractor Access:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon award of a contract, the contractor awarded the contract will be issued a request for a Contractor Entry Authority List (CEAL) by the contract administrator. Upon receipt, the contractor must compile the information required for the CEAL and submit a completed CEAL to the contract administrator. Until this occurs, no employees will be permitted to enter Malmstrom AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The contracting office approves the list and hand carries it to the Pass and Registration Section (341 SFS/S5B) for review. S5B personnel will compare the approving official's signature against a DD Form 577, <strong>Signature Card</strong>, or an appropriate letter on file at pass and registration. S5B then hand carries the submission to the 911 Dispatch Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A 911 dispatcher certified on the National Criminal Information Center system (NCIC) will run the contractor names through the NCIC for wants and warrants. The 911Dispatch Center will input all listed employees' names and data into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database for a background check in accordance with Air Force directives. Unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation, including, but not limited to, individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories: those having outstanding wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offenders, those who are on probation, and those who are in a pre-release program. The definition of sex offender and violent offender can be found at Montana Code Annotated &sect; 46-23-502. After the dispatcher completes the NCIC check, they will sign the letters and return them to S5B. Unfavorable results will be grounds for denial of entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor personnel requesting a contractor pass will provide a picture ID</p>
<p>to be verified against the Contractor EAL. Those employees, who clear the background check process, will be issued passes by S5B, located in Building 250, for the duration of the contract or one year, whichever period is shorter. For contracts lasting more than one year, including contract options, renewals and extensions, the contractor must repeat the above stated process on an annual basis. In addition, the process must be initiated for all new employees who are added to the CEAL after its initial submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Contractors are required to notify the contracting officer and S5B if an employee on a CEAL terminates his or her employment with the contractor or is involved in an incident that would result in unfavorable results from the background check including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4 above. If a contractor terminates an employee, it is incumbent upon the contractor to ensure that the employee's access badge is returned to the Pass and Registration office. If they are unable to retrieve the pass, they will contact S5B with the employee's information. S5B will then contact the installation entry control points and have them retrieve the pass if the person attempts to re-enter the base. In the case of a missile field contractor the S5B will contact Keys and Codes Control Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are contractor employees must use their contractor's pass when entering Malmstrom AFB for the performance of contract services. Under no circumstance will retired military members or dependents of active duty or retired military members vouch contractor personnel onto the installation utilizing their Armed Forces Identification Card. All DoD contractors who have been issued a Common Access Card will be allowed to sign people onto the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Violations of the stated entry procedures will be considered a breach of contract and the contracting officer will take appropriate action in accordance with the contract. Repeated or flagrant violations of this policy may result in termination of the contract for default.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor/vendor passes are for granting access to the installation for the sole purpose of employment. These passes do not permit access to or usage of government facilities or services (i.e., gym, service station, and dining hall.) However, during contractor/vendor "duty hours," the Burger King, Base Exchange Bowling Alley and Grizzly Bend Club eateries may be utilized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Local delivery companies (e.g., food, furniture, appliances) will submit a letter to the 341 SFS Pass and Registration Section containing the name of the company, the driver's name(s), date of birth, driver's license number and vehicle information. All information will be cross-checked against the installation barment and revocation list and the NCIC via the 911 Dispatch Center prior to approval. A copy of the letter will be maintained in the possession of the driver requesting entry. If the driver does not possess a letter, he/she will be directed to the VCC where an AF IMT 75, <strong>Visitor/Vehicle Pass</strong>, will be issued after verification of the delivery has been made through the on-base residence sponsor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or log, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) in support of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG&reg;) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number RECOVERY - ARRAOS: ST10-1094 for an initiative called, "Quality Assurance Support for the Janus Software Development Project and the Janus Phase 3 Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA." <br />
<p><strong>PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM EDT JULY 2, 2010.&nbsp; EMAIL QUESTIONS AND/OR CLARIFICATIONS IN WRITING TO THE POINT OF CONTACT BY 12:00 PM EDT JUNE 21, 2010.<br /></strong><br />The scope of this project is to acquire Subcontractor support to provide Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus software development project; Janus Infrastructure Development and Implementation for FDA ARRAOS (Janus Phase III) and whose main scope and objectives are described below for context. The work includes comprehensive testing and QA support for all aspects and phases of the Janus Phase III project. Application functionality testing and testing of interfaces to other systems, as well as, relevant Enterprise Services in the caBIG Service Portfolio. A more specific project service list will grow throughout the project lifecycle, and is being added to project documentation and deliverables accessible at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus-iii/, and is within scope of this request. <br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology Quality Assurance (NCI CBIIT QA) staff oversee's the analysis, coordination, planning and facilitation of quality test plans and quality testing for the quality assurance (QA) environments designated by each application project's plan, and implemented by selected independent QA contractor(s), NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that the selected independent QA contractor adheres to all NCI CBIIT policies and procedures, uses the testing paradigms and standards that are acceptable to NCI CBIIT, and provides communication to NCI leadership regarding best /avoid practices and the overall health of the project quality. NCI CBIIT QA actively insures that through the selected independent QA contractor the final application and services will provide acceptable functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability, as well as oversight and review of certification and accreditation of systems.<br />The National Cancer Institute's Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology has been actively defining, designing, developing, and deploying key infrastructure and application-level components of the IT fabric necessary to support the 21st-Century vision for integrated Biomedical Research, Translational Medicine and Personalized Health Management, a composite environment and context often referred to as the " Oncology Knowledge Cloud." In particular, the Knowledge Cloud is being developed with a focus on developing and deploying reference implementations of specifications developed to support and enable "Business Interoperability" between stakeholders throughout the Knowledge Cloud. In particular, development activities are focused on utilizing a variety of standards that support technical interoperability, as well as on utilizing a number of Best Practices drawn from the collective experiences in both the commercial and open-source software engineering communities. The software components deployed by CBIIT will be based on a commitment to open-source, open-access development with the goal of promoting the maximum amount of sharing and integration. In addition, however, components will be specified in such a manner so as to enable bindings to non-CBIIT technology platforms in other commercial or open-source implementations.<br />It is anticipated that the Janus development project will process legacy and newly created Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) study data sets as submissions, validate the submission against standard rules and automate the processing of the SDTM datasets from the time they are made available for loading from FDA's electronic document rooms (EDR) through their validation and loading into the Janus clinical study data repository. In addition, the Janus development project will enhance the Janus database (to v 2.0) to a more robust database design and improved analytical and visualization functions. <br />The QA of all associated development iterations and releases will be required in appropriate testing environments to move to next step in the development and deployment lifecycle, as determined by project team and project management plan. <br />In progress, are the gathering of requirements and system design documents for Janus phase 3 system, including the 2.0 database model and a SDTM Validation Service (which will automatically load new SDTM datasets into a staging area, perform SDTM validation checks, generate error reports describing all errors, and send them to FDA-designated recipients) from extension of the Janus Phase II pilot.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to provide all aspects of Software Quality Assurance (QA) support for the Janus system throughout its full software development lifecycle. In this request the subcontractor is asked to provide a variety of management and QA services including but not limited to: <br />(a) Work with development teams to produce and maintain appropriate QA and testing plans for new releases of software: <br />(b) Work with development teams and end users to produce test cases: <br />(c) Conduct integration testing, regression and staging testing of software prior to release: <br />(d) Test case automation: <br />(e) Assist with user acceptance testing of software prior to release: <br />(f) Support for Bug Fixes: <br />(g) Troubleshoot Data Issues: <br />(h) Deliver Test Reports: <br />(i) Formal systems validation is not included within the scope of this request.<br />(j) As the system may be validated in the future any design or errors that would prevent or hinder validation known, or anticipated, should be brought to the attention of the project manager for consideration in development.<br />&bull; Test the Phase 3 operational pilot's ability to function as a study data warehouse to support comparative effectiveness analysis of clinical trials data. Using test data provided by FDA identify errors and operational deficiencies.</p>
<p><br />Design and development of the system will be performed by a separate subcontractor under a separate contract. It is expected that the awardee(s) of this contract will interact with the development and architecture teams and any open source developers, to insure all found errors and bugs are eliminated, as part of this QA work; or formulate mitigation strategies (plans), to be designed and approved , by both FDA and NCI.</p>

The Department of State (DOS) removed the previous www.fbo.gov posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005 for administrative convenience. DOS still considers SAQMMA10R0005 as an active solicitation and all dates and timelines including the mandatory synopsis period remain in effect. DOS will now consider requests to attend the mandatory preproposal conference received by 1:00pm EDT Monday April 26. NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010) Worldwide Protective Services (WPS) The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. SPECIAL NOTES: 1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work. Anticipated Acquisition Schedule DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States Government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government (USG) priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION. THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. The High Power Microwaves Technologies Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave, millimeter wave, and other directed energy systems via this High Energy Research and Applications (HERA) program. B. The HERA program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high energy research to include High Power Microwave (HPM), and millimeter wave system and technology development. This program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&amp;D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/RDH capital resources, facilities, and experience. This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&amp;D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power. In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&amp;D service and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities. Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory, the High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/RD, and portions of other AFRL buildings. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR). As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive laboratory / facilities service and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects. Most contractor personnel will be required to have SECRET level clearances, and some must be clearable for access to RESTRICTED DATA, CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION, FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, SCI, and Non-SCI. C. The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $60-75M over five years. FY08 - $12-15M; FY09 - $12-15M; FY10 - $12-15M; FY11 - $12-15M; FY12 $12-15M. The resulting contract will be awarded with a not-to-exceed ceiling of $75M. This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards. This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area. If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order. If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: overall scientific and technical merits, importance to AFRL/RD programs; and affordability. AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation. Technical Areas are described below. TECHNICAL AREA 1. High Power Microwave Development: Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW and average/continuous (CW) HPM systems capable of generating hundreds of kW to few MW are of interest to the HERA program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target. The thrust of this activity is to -- Identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power, and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; also of interest are sources that can provide average/CW power of hundred of kW to few MW. -- Execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results. -- Downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results. -- Coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred. Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical area and the Theoretical and Computation R&amp;D Technical Area 2 is expected. A further aspect of this technical area is to -- Investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development. Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere. Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits. TECHNICAL AREA 2. Theoretical and Computational R&amp;D: The objectives of this technical area are to develop theoretical techniques and computational tools to: -- Advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments. -- Conduct numerical analysis of such devices which typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types. Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software. -- Explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies. This task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness. -- Gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems. The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements. -- Conduct engagement level Model and Simulation (M&amp;S) to address scale system requirements. For example, use of EADSIM to assess duty cycle impact on mission for airborne active denial. -- Describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target." These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, and scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem. -- Determine scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities. TECHNICAL AREA 3. Pulsed Power (PP) and Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&amp;D: The goals of this technical area are to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems. This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&amp;D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/RD applications. The work under this Technical Area includes: -- Hardware design, fabrication, assembly, and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems. Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state). Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness. This Technical Area also includes the exploration and development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical areas. The scope of this effort includes -- Designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s). Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads. Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators. Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances. Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads. Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds. Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds. Pulse power systems work may include -- Fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics. This technical area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles. Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments. Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times. The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds. Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance. TECHNICAL AREA 4. Prime Power: The goal of this technical area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems. This is an enabling technical area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains. Areas of research for this technical area include -- Design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like. -- Investigation and modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design. TECHNICAL AREA 5. Technology Demonstrator Development, Operation and Testing The objective of this technical area is to develop a full scale prototype once a technology is identified for development. This includes -- Conceptual studies, system designs, design drawings, fabrication of subsystems, system integration, engineering and technician support in servicing (including spares) and operating such prototype for purpose of testing and demonstration. Emphasis should be placed on balancing risk, use of commercial of the shelf (COTS), state-of-the art and/or new subsystem technologies for full system design and development. -- Platforms to be considered for system integration and demonstrator development should include but not be limited to land and airborne systems. TECHNICAL AREA 6. System Integration and Demonstration The objective of this technical area is to develop, simulate, fabricate, test, demonstrate, package and fully integrate HPM aerial and ground systems according to form, fit, and function requirements defined by AFRL/RDH using HPM technology. HPM technology includes but is not limited by, existing sources such as the Advanced Counter Electronic Source (ACES), or newly developed sources such at the Relativistic Magnetron (RelMag). The intentions of this task area are to deliver aerial and ground based HPM weapon systems to the end user that is close to an end product. This task includes: -- For both the ground and aerial HPM system, military feasibility studies of the integrated package, system designs, fabrication of components to fabrication of the majority of the system, survivability studies, testing for EMI/EMC, testing individual components, testing the overall system, operator manuals, engineering and technician support, and demonstrating the system in an operational realistic environment. -- For both the ground and aerial HPM systems satisfying form and fit requirements of the end user by designing or replacing components with more efficient, smaller, or lighter technology. This fit requirement can also be satisfied by a redesign of the overall system or the redesign of the orientation of components to ensure the dimensions and weight is minimized. -- For aerial systems safety of flight and SEEK EAGLE standards should be taken into account for design of the end product. Additionally, survivability, fusing methods, delivery of the platform to one or more three-dimensional points in space, and internal/external modifications to the aerial platform should be taken into account. Due to the nature of the aerial platform, an in-depth understanding of air platforms is required as well as requirements of the United States Air Force concerning these types of systems should be understood. The aerial platform options may include current munition type inventories and/or specifically designed systems for HPM payloads. -- For aerial HPM systems the delivery method includes fighter and/or bomber type aircraft. Detailed knowledge and understanding is required to successfully merge the aerial HPM system to the aircraft. -- For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the military feasibility studies is to determine the effectiveness and worthiness of the integrated system given the appropriate platform and HPM parameters. This includes studies of the effectiveness against targets sets such as centers of gravities and facilities with electronic systems. -- For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the survivability studies is to ensure the continued nominal operation of the integrated system in the presence of extremes such as, but not limited to, vibration, pressure, and temperature. The survivability study shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. -- For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the demonstration phase is to validate military feasibility and worthiness against realistic target sets and collateral effects on subsystems in real world scenarios. The demonstration shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. Platforms considered for system integration shall include but is not limited to airborne and mobile ground based systems. D. GENERAL INFORMATION.

ALL TERRAIN CRANES returning from southwest Asia will be repaired/overhauled to 10/20 standards including repair/overhaul of delayed desert damage as required.   Estimated release date of the solicitation is 15 Jul 2010.  The offer due date will be on or about 16 Aug 2010.  Once solicitation is released, it will available on our webpage contracting.tacom.army.mil/sol.htm or email dami_amsta-idq@conus.army.mil.   This buy will result in a 5 year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract.  The acquisition is being sole sourced to Grove U.S.L.L.C through the Justification and Approval process under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements).  Obtaining the requirement from another source under a competitive acquisition process would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  Grove owns the proprietary technical data rights covering the systems already fielded and now being RESET.

<DESC>NOTE: SOLICITATION NUMBER IS INCORRECT.  THE CORRECT SOLICITATION NUMBER FOR OCC GROUP LIFE INSURANCE IS CC-10-HQ-R-0037.

This is a solicitation notice for the Department of Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Group Life Insurance.  The OCC is seeking an experienced and qualified Contractor to underwrite and administer its group term life insurance program for its active and retired employees and their eligible dependants.  OCC employees have the choice of electing coverage for their life insurance through the Federal Employee Government Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and/or through OCC's Group Life Insurance program.  Employees can also elect to waive coverage under both programs.  

OCC Group Life Insurance currently consists of basic life insurance coverage and three types of optional life insurance programs.  These optional programs include (1) optional employee coverage in $25,000 increments up to $400,000, (2) spouse coverage of 50% or 100% of the employee's basic life amount and (3) family coverage in multiples of $5,000 (partner) or $2,500 (child) up to $25,000 (partner) and $12,500 (child).  The OCC and its employees share in the cost of premiums on the basic life insurance, however, optional coverage is the complete responsibility of the employee.  The employee-share of insurance premiums is deducted from their bi-weekly pay on an after-tax basis.  OCC group life does not include a disability waiver extension.  All pre-existing conditions and illnesses are to be covered for currently enrolled employees and retirees, where applicable.  Enrolled participants shall be immediately eligible for the plan upon its effective date.  

All responsible insurance carriers may submit questions to Andrea Lipiro by 6/21/10.

PROPOSALS SHALL BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN JULY 17TH 2010 AT 5PM EST.  Please refer to attached solicitation documentation for submission instructions.

The solicitation with supporting documents (if any) will be posted to the FedBizOpps website on or about April 28, 2010.  No hard copies of the solicitation, supporting documents and applicable amendments, if any will be provided. To receive the entire solicitation package and any applicable amendments, prospective offerors must download them from the FedBizOpps website.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract.  A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers for this procurement.

Technical factors consist of past performance and technical capability. Technical factors when combined are approximately equal when compared to cost or price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

<DESC>Billing Contract
Statement of Work

The primary purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to accomplish the following Billing objectives:

Provide Billing services as an extended business office solution with the generation, processing and submission of Hospital and Professional Medical Claims to Third and First Party Payers on behalf of (VHA) Veterans Health Administration facilities.

Establish and maintain a productive cost-effective Billing system that:

Incorporates industry standard performance metrics that monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the system;

Establishes a reporting mechanism that measures return on investment that is in line with negotiated performance metrics

Allows the VAMC to meet and/or exceed their TRICARE/CHAMPVA goals by optimizing third and first party reimbursements, in part through aggressive, accurate and timely billing

Incorporates performance metrics that monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the billing process Key Assumptions:

Definitions are provided (Attachment A)

A minimum of 125 claims per individual contracted staff member will be processed each day. The claims may be for any backlog and/or current episodes of care.

Claims which cannot be billed due to no insurance coverage or data validation/compliance issues will be assigned a "Reason Not Billable" in Claims Tracking and when appropriate bills will be cancelled in the Integrated Billing Software Package.

VA can only bill health insurance carriers for treatment of non-service connected conditions provided to veterans. Any questions regarding a veteran's service connected status should be referred to the VAMC.

VI-IA submits claims for supplemental Medicare payers to Trailblazer's for development of a Medicare Remittance Advice. Contract staff is responsible for working MRA errors returned from Trailblazers or clearing house as part of the task of completing the claim and does not generate an additional cost transaction. VHA does not send all claims for Medicare supplemental payers to Trailblazer. Certain Medicare supplemental claims are filed directly with supplemental payers without use of the MRA transaction. Contract staff is responsible for working payer rejects of MRA exclusion claims as part of the task of completing the claim.

The VA is not authorized to bill Medicare or Medicaid. There are also specific services that are excluded from billing through the e-MRA process to obtain the Medicare Remittance Advice (MRA). Contract staff is responsible for maintaining a current list of services that are billable for the MRA and understanding proper coordination of benefit issues. Contractor will attach the MRA exclusionary listing to the bill or claim when needed.
 
The Contractor must notify the VA facility of any Release Of Information (ROl) needed for claims processing.

The software application providing bill scrubbing edits used by the VA shall be used by Contractor staff. All edits will be reviewed and corrected as appropriate.

VHA's rate structure, commonly called reasonable charges, must be used when preparing claims.

VA information will not be co-mingled with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems/media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitation can be met. VA also reserves the right to conduct IT resource inspections to ensure data separation and on-site inspection of information destruction/media sanitization procedures to ensure they are in compliance with VA policy requirements.

The Contractor is subject to the same principles in regards to separation of duties. If the Contractor has a contract for both Billing and AR follow-up, the same staff cannot work on both processes.

Contractor agrees that all deliverables, associated working papers, and other material deemed relevant by the Contractor in the performance of these tasks are the property of the United States Government.

"Business Day" is defined as Monday through Friday, excluding standard Federal Holidays and any other day specifically declared to be a national holiday.

All scheduled contacts between the Contractor and VAMC staff shall occur during regular VAMC hours of operation.

General Requirements:

All written deliverables shall be phrased in layperson language. Statistical and other technical terminology shall not be used without providing a glossary of terms.

For every task, the Contractor shall identify in writing all necessary subtasks (if any), associated costs by task with associated sub-milestone dates. The Contractor's subtask structure shall be reflected in the technical proposal.

<DESC>This is the Pre-solicitation Notice for the Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Selectable Output Weapon Industry Day held March 2010. (Reference: Request for Information N6893609R0015). Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement are sought to develop and demonstrate technology that will enable a 500 lb class bomb with 2 or more cockpit selectable output modes using MIL-STD-1760 or other existing aircraft-to-weapon mechanical and electrical interfaces.   Current and planned future Navy, Marine and Air Force manned and unmanned combat aircraft should be considered.  It is envisioned that one output mode will have lethality comparable to the current BLU-111.  It is also envisioned that one output mode will have as small of a collateral damage radius as possible consistent with maintaining a high degree of lethality against a variety of targets including, but not limited to personnel in the open and in buildings and stationary and moving unarmored vehicles! , assuming current Circular Error Probable (CEPs) and Target Location Error (TLEs).  A key element of any technology pursued is that it shall not accidentally function in a higher collateral damage mode than desired or commanded.  It is currently desired that the end product retain the overall aerodynamic shape and mass properties of the existing BLU-111 in order to maintain compatibility with precision guidance kits, JDAM (including Laser JDAM) and LGB, and minimize future integration efforts.  It is highly desired that all explosive material be consumed or other wise rendered safe when the weapon is functioned regardless of output mode selected.  The end product should be consistent with typical weapon design considerations such as Insensitive Munitions, fuze safety (MIL-STD-1316), energetic material qualification requirements (MIL-STD-1751) etc.   The end product should be able to function reliably and safely after environmental extremes encountered during a normal military lifecycle and during normal operating extremes.  The design should be focused to minimize production and lifecycle costs.
A phased approach is required.  Phase I will be a base contract.  Phase II and Phase III are priced options.  Phase I of this BAA will focus on analyses and testing to select or verify technologies and configurations that will meet a variety of potentially competing operational requirements.  For Phase II, the intent is to focus efforts on maturing technologies of the various subsystems required to achieve selectable output and mitigate risk associated with transitioning the technology into the design having the same aerodynamic shape, mass properties and interfaces as the existing BLU-111. The purpose of Phase III is to integrate sub-systems to demonstrate a selectable  output 500 pound class bomb with multiple outputs that can be selected by the pilot from the cockpit This phase is to end with a technology that is at, or above, TRL 6.
This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation will not be issued.
The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA. NAWCWD reserves the right to select and fund all, some, or none of the subsequent Proposals received under this BAA.  NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Any material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of NAWCWD to treat all Proposals as competition sensitive Bid and Proposal Information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. See enclosed attachment for specific submission and formatting information that must be followed when preparing proposals in response to this announcement. 
Awards to offerors of selected Proposals will be in the form of contracts. Therefore, Proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). 
See enclosed attachment for specific submission and formatting information that must be followed when preparing proposals for this contracting effort.

<DESC>Military communications networks exist in order to support information flow up to higher headquarters and command direction down to the executing units. As the executing units (both afloat and on ground) have become more dispersed, the networks have become more complex due to the variety of communication technologies required to enable both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications including intra- and inter-unit. It is assumed that network(s) will never be fully connected (fragmented) at any one point in time. In order to assist the Navy and Marine Corps in addressing their communications network issues, ONR Codes 30 and 31 invest in science and technology initiatives that will provide for future reductions in human maintenance of networking capabilities.

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for efforts that develop and demonstrate technologies addressing selected network communications issues. These are considered to be supporting technologies required to enable improvements throughout the communications realms of interest. 

This effort will develop S&T technologies and products that significantly enhance tactical edge communications networks. Solutions are to be delivered at a technology readiness level (TRL) suitable for transition to acquisition Programs of Record (nominally requiring a TRL of 6). Prior to transition to PORs, the technology and products developed here will first be evaluated via a fleet-led government-coordinated experimentation process. The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that are sufficiently robust to provide to the warfighter. Potential PORs include, but are not limited to, the Navy Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) Future Capabilities, USMC Marine Air-Ground Task Force C24ISR, USMC Warfighter Information Network-Expeditionary (WIN-X) and US Army CERDEC, US Army Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), JTRS and AFRL-related programs.

The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct an Industry Day on Friday, June 25, 2010 at Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20375. 
Building 222 Auditorium. No Foreign Nationals are permitted. Check-in will begin at 8:00 AM Eastern Time. 

For details concerning registration to attend this event, please contact the following point of contact (POC):  Registration POC: Barbarajo Cox, BJ.Cox@nrl.navy.mil, 202-767-2804.

You must be registered for base access. There will be no late registration or registration on the day of the event.

The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies.<BR><BR>Construction will take place on-structure, atop a parking garage designed to accommodate parking for special events, park and city visitors and those working at the man  y businesses throughout the downtown area. Site preparation for this contract will require installing a waterproofing system on the roof of the parking garage. The waterproofing will consist of applying a hot fluid over the concrete deck. The fluid is a rubberized asphalt system with protection board and root barriers. Associated with the work are concrete repairs, sealant joints, and 3 compression joints with cover plates. The waterproofing contractor will be responsible for deck preparation; furnishing and installing the system; and providing protection and repairs to the system during installation of the surface features. The contractor must be certified to install the system and provide a five year warranty. The main feature consists of the Event Lawn, which will provide a place for public gatherings both large and small. A granite paved walkway will be constructed along the west and south edges of the lawn. On the western edge, a stage and canopy will be constructed fac  ing the lawn. The stage is a raised platform paved in granite with a shade structure above. Decorative lighting will be incorporated into the ceiling and also mounted to the canopy's columns. Speakers will be strategically placed at the canopy and at certain areas of the lawn in order to accommodate major festivals that require sound. The lawn rises one and a half feet from the west to the east. The grade change is contained by stone seatwalls to the north and south, the east and west ends are flush with surrounding grade. Within the lawn sit specimen shade trees, alternating with pedestrian post top lights, and punctuated by several sets of stone steps. <BR><BR>This is set-aside for Small Businesses. The proposals will be evaluated based on a best value source selection process. The selection process will evaluate such factors as: Prime Contractor Past Experience and Prime Contractor Past Performance, Price, and Pro Forma information. The estimated cost range for this proje  ct is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 237990, with a size standard of $33.5M. The base construction contract duration is approximately 300 days. The approximate issue date is 24 May 2010 and approximate closing date is 24 June 2010, 11:00 am Eastern Time. Downloading of the project documents requires registration at the FedBizOps (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Amendments will be available from the FedBizOps website by download only. Prior to submission of proposals all contractors must have an active registration in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) data base. To register or update information go to http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>RECOVERY  INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (ISRDS) CONTRACTNUMBER NNA08CG83C. &lt;P&gt;THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLEONLY TO STINGER GHAFFARIAN TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (SGT, INC.) UNDER CONTRACT NUMBERNNA08CG83C FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (ISRDS) AT NASA AMESRESEARCH CENTER (ARC) LOCATED AT MOFFETT FIELD, CA.  THIS IS AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA).	 ARC modified contract numberNNA08CG83C to fully fund Task Order 84 with ARRA funds.  ARC issued Task Order 84, titledImpact of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations in the NAS. This task supports NASARecovery Act work sponsored by the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and theAirspace Systems Program.  Research funded by this task will focus on addressing thecapacity challenges facing the US national airspace. It is forecast that over the next 15years, air traffic in the United States will double, far exceeding the countrys currentcapability to safely fly aircraft. To handle this growth, NASA is contributing toward thedevelopment of the Next Generation Air Transportation Management System (NextGen). Airspace simulations and modeling are important methods used by researchers to create afuture national airspace system that is safe and reliable.  Many future concepts, such asallowing Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) to routinely operate in the airspace, requiresimulations which model not only our current airspace but also a future airspace withmore aircraft and increasingly complex operations.  In support of this effort, the contractor shall use modeling and simulation tools toconduct an assessment of the impact that UAS operations will have on the current andfuture airspace.  This includes generating modeling data (or a demand data set) for theexperiment and performing a gap analysis.  The objective of this work is to enhanceexisting government tools to generate demand data sets that can be used to model currentand future UAS operations.  This data set and others generated will be used to determinethe impact of UAS operations under a variety of conditions.  Additionally, usingpublically available literature, the contractor shall prepare a gap analysis whichidentifies issues specific to the future air traffic system known as NextGen.  Inaddition to the analysis, the contractor shall provide the government with copies of allsoftware, software administrative and users guides, models, and data used in the courseof this task. For all work produced in this task, the government has a strong preferencefor data, methods, tools, algorithms and technologies which are openly available and donot require any sensitive or propriety protections.  Where the contractor utilizessensitive or proprietary information, they will be responsible for the appropriatehandling and protection of the information.  Additionally, should any of this informationbe included in deliverables, the contractor shall guarantee the document containing theinformation and information itself is properly marked to ensure properhandling/protection.Task Order 84 is funded by the Recovery Act.  A contract modification was issued to fullyfund this task order.  The Intelligent Systems Research and Development Support (ISRDS)contract number NNA08CG83C was made on a competitive basis. &lt;P&gt;This announcement is for informational purposes only. All questions and/or concerns mustbe submitted to the point of contact contained herein in writing via e-mail to thefollowing address: sarah.m.andrae@nasa.gov. &lt;P&gt;An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228. The modification addresses the following work:
<p>These funds will be used for:<br />&bull; Technology Development and Field Trials of EGS Drilling Systems ($348,507): Sandia National Laboratories will develop a drilling system based upon pneumatic down the hammer bits and polycrystalline diamond compact bits.<br />&bull; Base Technologies and Tools for Supercritical Reservoirs ($55,400): Sandia National Laboratories will design, develop, and field test highly integrated, high temperature data loggers using silicon on insulator and silicon carbide technologies.</p>
<p>The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance. Cost cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain. The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract. Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter. The work falls within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy which is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled "Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy" that states: "The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation."</p>
<p>NOTE: This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. 382 that recognizes Work Authorization no. GT-100003-20685-10 issued under Management and Operating Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000. This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.</p>

<DESC>Recovery - This notice is provided for information purposes only. NASA LaRC awardeda fixed-price contract to Boeing Inc. entitled Integrated Methods to Enable the DetectionPrediction Mitigation-Management of Aging-Related Hazards. This competitive action isfunded in its entirety by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). This awardresults from a competitive selection under the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA Research Announcement (NRA) forfoundational research in support of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate(ARMD),entitled Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009 under NNH09ZEA001N,Amendment to Appendix B.2  Aircraft Aging and durability Project (AAD1) (Recovery Act).The Aircraft Aging and Durability (AAD) project is part of the Aviation Safety Program.AAD project focuses on aging and damage processes in recently designed and certifiedaircraft, rather than life extension of aircraft which have been in production for manyyears. The AAD project emphasizes new and emerging material systems and fabricationtechniques as well as the potential hazards associated with aging-related degradation(process resulting in reduction of material or structural quality). The AAD project goalis to take a proactive approach to identifying aging-related hazards before they becomecritical, and to develop technology and processes to incorporate aging mitigation andmaintenance into the design of future civilian and military aircraft. The project isorganized relative to three themed areas: detect, predict, and mitigate. The purpose ofthis contract is to support NASA LaRC in research related to the study of system levelconcepts (concepts that view the process as a whole, instead of addressing one part ofthe process without regard to how changing that part will impact the other parts of theprocess) and specific mitigation concepts for improving the material and structuraldurability for transport fuselage structures. The research focus area for this contractis to develop system-level concepts for implementing advanced capabilities to transportfuselage structures in real-world operational environments.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): W9127N10D0002<br><br>Portland District Corps of Engineers has issued Task Order 0008 under Contract W9127N-10-D-0002 for the following procurement:  The Contractor shall characterize dredged material using a modified incremental sampling (IS) approach concurrently with conventional sampling protocols found in the 2009 Sediment Evaluation Framework for the Pacific Northwest (SEF), and to compare the effectiveness and utility of each methodology.  IS was originally developed by the mining industry and was studied by the Corps for use at explosives-contaminated sites as a way to minimize sampling and subsampling errors by collecting a large number of closely-spaced surface soil samples that are then composited and submitted to a laboratory as a single sample.  To the best of our knowledge, IS has not been used to characterize dredged material.  The primary goal of IS (as applied to dredged material testing) is to collect equal amounts of material (known as increments) from each core to create a super-composite of material weighing about 1,000 g (wet weight), and then extract and analyze a greater mass of material than what is typically analyzed under the SEF protocol.  Results of the analysis shall determine if analyses conducted on a larger subsample pulled from a composite of many cores better represents the true value of the particular analyte(s) in a given unit of material (aka the decision unit).  The Corps has selected the Post Office Bar as the study area.  Post Office Bar is a shoaling area located within the Federal Navigation Channel (FNC) in the Lower Willamette River (LWR) at river mile 2.1-2.4.  The proposed dredging prism (DP) varies from 2 to 10 feet deep, with approximately 10% sand.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 MAY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 23 MAY 2010. Contact Sheila Midgette at 252-335-6493 or Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address: <br /><br />USCG Aviation Logistics Center<br />Short Range Recovery Division, Bldg 75<br />Attn: Sheila Midgette<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1

<DESC>VOYAGER INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM REMOTE HOSTING The Department of State intends to procure, on a sole source basis, hardware, software and services necessary to set up remote hosting for the Ralph J. Bunche Library's Voyager Integrated Library system. <br />As outlined below, this service is deemed only available from ExLibris. <br />The remote hosting service must be able to remote host the Library's current Integrated Library System, Voyager. The Voyager system consists of a client server system running ExLibris's Voyager software with a Unix operating system on an Oracle platform with a web based online public access catalog interface known as WebVoyage. Only Ex Libris is able to fulfill this requirement because the Voyager software is proprietary to Ex Libris and only Ex Libris' remote hosting services are compatible with the existing Voyager system.<br />Contracting with ExLibris will ensure that all the Department's library system services can be maintained by a single vendor for a seamless interface among services and in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible. The Bunche Library already has a Voyager software maintenance service with ExLibris to resolve technical problems with the Voyager client/server software without any additional cost. The software maintenance service also includes free upgrades to the Voyager system, which are needed to keep the Library's Voyager integrated library system robust and up-to-date with the latest functionality. Since ExLibris currently has no access to DoS servers, costly onsite visits are required for software upgrades and troubleshooting that would otherwise be included in the software maintenance costs. With the Voyager system remote hosted, ExLibris can easily access the dedicated DoS server and can provide the DoS with maximized efficiencies and reduced costs for software maintenance as well as remote hosting services for the Voyager Integrated Library System. <br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br />The Bunche Library, Department of State, is seeking to remote host their Voyager system, including support of the WebVoyage user interface to the system. The vendor shall provide hosting of the Bunche Library's Voyager system at a remote location. <br />The remote hosting effort includes creating a separate Voyager database for International Information Programs (IIP). The hosted system shall consist of two separate databases: the Bunche Library database and the new International Information Programs (IIP) database. These two databases shall be partitioned, but configured to run jointly on the Bunche Library's existing licensed ExLibris Voyager software. The two databases shall be configured so that the Bunche Library database and IIP database can be searched separately and also be searched simultaneously to retrieve a single set of search results.<br />The vendor shall provide hardware and hardware support to run an Oracle based client server Voyager system using the Solaris 10 Unix or Red Hat Linux operating system. Access to the server(s) by ExLibris, the software vendor for Voyager, shall be allowed in order to troubleshoot software problems and perform installation of services packs and new releases of the Voyager software. <br />This remote hosting service shall be a secure, comprehensive hardware and hardware support solution that shall also include:<br />Disaster recovery <br />Production hardware platform<br />Platinum hardware maintenance<br />On-site spare parts<br />24 x 7 professional operators for monitoring service for hardware and operating system software<br />Centralized backup facilities<br />Redundant environmental systems (power, cooling, and humidity)<br />Robust UPS facilities<br />Diesel power generators (independent power plant)<br />No fewer than 3 ISPs proving OC3 level bandwidth to the facility with load balancing<br />Redundant firewalls<br />Redundant routers<br />Highly secure datacenter<br />The service shall also provide nightly backups and Oracle exports of the database along with secure, off-site storage for the backups.<br />The vendor shall provide prior notification to the Bunche Library of any events or procedures that could or would affect response time or access to services provided to Bunche Library. <br />ADDITIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />The Bureau of Administration, Global Information Services, Office of Information Programs and Services, Archiving and Access Systems Management Division will assume the Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) responsibilities for Voyager and provide ongoing support for the virtual server access to Voyager. <br />The vendor shall be responsible for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, of destruction of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the Department of State and information systems used or operated by the Department of State or by the vendor on behalf of the Department of State.<br />The vendor shall provide a dedicated server for remote hosting of the Department of State's Voyager system. This server shall be for the exclusive use of the Department of State database and WebVoyage online catalog and shall not include data from any other customer nor shall access be provided to the Department of State dedicated server for any customer other than the Department of State.<br />The vendor shall not outsource the maintenance of the DoS Voyager dedicated server to any party outside the United States of America without written consent from the Department of State. The vendor shall not move the physical location of the DoS Voyager dedicated server to a location outside the United States of America without written consent from the Department of State.<br />The vendor shall establish and maintain an SSH tunnel to the Department of State Voyager virtual server that shall include all 70XX ports for Voyager clients, port 1521 for ODBC access for report generation (Voyager Access), and the 80XX ports for WebVoyage. <br />The vendor shall not initiate any connections to the Department of State network. The Department of State agrees that it will configure the firewall to allow traffic to flow back to the Voyager client initiated within the Department of State DMZ. <br />OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT<br />The Ralph J. Bunche Library, U.S. Department of State, will be the owner of all content created and updated by the vendor. All content generated shall be for the sole use of and becomes the exclusive property of the U.S. Government. <br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Office of Acquisition Management<br />1701 N. Ft. Myer Drive<br />Arlington, VA 22209
