<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for Avcoat thermal protectionmaterials and associated engineering services to support the continued development of theCrew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Thermal Protection System (TPS) heat shield.  The heatshield protects the space vehicle and its occupants during re-entry into the Earthsatmosphere.NASA/ARC intends to purchase the Avcoat materials and associated engineering servicesfrom Textron Defense Systems of Wilmington, MA, under the statutory authority of 10 USC2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will SatisfyAgency Requirements.  Avcoat is Textrons proprietary material, thus no other contractorcan supply the material and the associated engineering expertise currently required byNASA.	In 2006, Textron was one of four companies competitively awarded a Phase 1 contract forinitial testing of their TPS ablative heat shield materials.  In 2007, ARC conducted acompetitive procurement (full and open) to select heat shield materials and designs forfurther evaluation and development.  ARC awarded contract NNA07BC07C to Textron for Phase2 testing, evaluation, and development of two of its proprietary TPS materials, Avcoatand 3DQP.  Avcoats predecessor was the TPS material used on the heat shields of theApollo space vehicles in the 1960s to 1970s and successfully protected those vehiclesduring the intense heat of atmospheric entry and return from the moon.	In March 2009,after extensive testing and evaluation of many TPS candidate materials, NASA selectedTextrons Avcoat as the heat shield material for the Orion spacecraft.An Insight/Oversight team, led by NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), has been establishedto provide guidance and to oversee the continued development of the Avcoat heat shieldfor NASAs Constellation Program Office.  ARC is working with JSC on theInsight/Oversight team amongst other NASA centers, and ARC has the responsibility ofprocuring Avcoat materials for any required testing by NASA.  Thus, ARC requiresadditional Avcoat material and associated engineering services to conduct further testingand analysis of Avcoat.

<DESC>This Statement of Work is for Leadership and Program Management Support for the NextGen and Operations Planning Business Unit of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NextGen and Operations Planning Business Unit, also known as AJP, works to get the ATO ready for the air traffic of tomorrow and the strategies and solutions that achieve national and international goals by taking the lead on developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System, also known as NextGen.
In order to achieve these goals, the leadership within AJP requires support to improve program and project management processes. With the anticipated workload that NextGen will bring to the AJP organization, the leadership will need support in the management of multiple programs with multiple dependencies in a dynamically changing environment. This work environment requires an organization to be prepared to change and improve as each element of NextGen is put in place.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to publish the intent of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to solicit, negotiate, and award on a sole source basis to McDash Analytics, LLC, Denver, CODBA LPS Applied Analytics. The anticipated contract will be for a base year and four one-year option periods. FHFA utilizes data from McDash for analytical support to the examination of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Consequently, present conditions require that the data be currently operational for mission-critical analytics.
<p>McDash data provide current and historical loan-level information on mortgages and mortgagors nationwide with extensive coverage across securitized and non-securitized loans, both conforming and non-conforming. Further, FHFA must be able to download data in a user-friendly and timely manner, manipulate the data, and analyze the data at the loan-level. In addition, loan-level information critical to analysis for each mortgage must include, at a minimum, loan-level identifier, property location at zip code level, mortgage type (for example, first or second), loan type (for example, fixed or adjustable), interest rate on the mortgage, interest-only feature, origination date, current and original loan amount, property type (for example, single family, condominium, 2-4 family), loan purpose (for example, purchase, refinance, or cash-out refinance), credit score, occupancy (for example, primary or second property), documentation (for example, full, limited, or no documentation), and delinquency status (for example, current, 30-days, etc). As such, the data allow FHFA economists to analyze mortgage markets nationwide and evaluate the performance of mortgages related to the GSEs holdings and mission. McDash is used to perform such analyses, and an award to any other source would likely result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's critical mission. The costs and delays involved in procuring and implementing a new database are unlikely to be recoverable through competition, and will not be in the best interests of the Government should inconsistencies result in analysis of data and reporting of outcomes.</p>
<p>Interested sources capable of providing data that will perform as prescribed above are invited to demonstrate capability by submitting capability statements, pricing, and any other pertinent information that demonstrates capability and/or cost savings to provide the above software to larna.palmer@fhfa.gov no later than 2:30&nbsp;P.M. EDT, October 16, 2009.</p>

<RESPDATE>111809
<CONTACT>Janice S Olson, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-313-9497, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack.  The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost and Early Intercept Phases through Midcourse into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

MDA Advance Technology Directorate (DV) instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant advanced research at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  This BAA is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle to allow DV to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms to improve the BMDS capability and fill technology gaps.  

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).

Proposals are solicited only from eligible domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education.  Any award resulting from this BAA will be made only to an offeror that is a qualified education institution at time of award.  If the proposal is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the proposal is required to perform 50 percent or more of the effort.  For planning purposes, Firm-Fixed Price or Cost level of effort or completion type contracts are anticipated.  Although subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability, it is anticipated that each MSTAR contract is projected to be funded between $600,000 and $800,000 for a period of two or three years.  Funding ceilings are $300,000 a year during the two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.  Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the Government.  The Government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.

MDA requires that lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a proposal under this program hold US citizenship. MDA desires that participating students conducting research for or sponsored under this program award, hold US citizenship.  In addition, the Government reserves
the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, but who holds a valid green card, for participation in research for or sponsored through this program award. Students without valid green cards are ineligible for consideration and participation altogether.

If MDA decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVI; 256-955-1835, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Any awards are anticipated to occur early in fiscal year (FY) 2010 through FY 2011. 

Research Topics
MDA/DV is interested in development of advanced technology research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment.

The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict.  Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  

The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).  The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:  

EVALUATION FACTORS AND CRITERIA
MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: 
(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; 
(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 
(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; 
(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; 
(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and

Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.

The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror’s proposal:
(1)  The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; 
(2)  The offerors’ capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and 
(3)  The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk;  
(4)  Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.  

No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA covers the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 timeframe.  Response date for 2010 submission is not later than 18 November 2009.  Response date for 2011 will be established when the BAA is reposted next year.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a sole source modification to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), PO Box 11337, Tucson AZ 85734 for the depot level  repair of AIM/RIM-7 M/P Sparrow Guidance Control Section units, assemblies, and subassemblies for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and for the refurbishment of test equipment.  The period of performance is through February 2014.  The Sparrow missile is out-of-production, and RMS is the only firm capable of providing adequate post-production support for the missile at this point in the program.  RMS is the only firm with the specialized experience, test equipment, and special tooling to support USN and FMS repair needs in an efficient and timely manner.  Due to obsolescence issues, it would not be feasible for another company to procure the required parts to support the missiles.

Procurements under this class synopsis will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

The Government does not possess the Level III drawing package, specifications, test procedures, and test benches to allow for full and open competition.  The repairs/procurements are unique to the C-130J and derivative Type Model Series (T/M/S) aircraft and must integrate precisely with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility. 
This solicitation is being issued pursuant to the procedures at FAR 13.  Synopsis exception FAR 5.202(a)(13) applies and Solicitation Number N00164-10-T-0004 http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm is hereby issued as an attachment hereto.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Veeco Metrology, 112 Robin Hill Rd, Santa Barbara CA 93117 for the acquisition of an upgrade for an existing Nanoscope III AtomicForce Microscope (AFM). Veeco Metrology will provide all of the hardware and software needed to upgrade the existing Nanoscope III controller to a NanoScope V control station as well as retrofitting the existing AFM head; replace existing scanners with a 125 x 125 micron and 10 micron x 10 micron liquid resistant scanners; provide a new cantilever holder for operation in contact mode, tapping mode, and force modulation in liquids; provide temperature control capability for operation on samples in air or in liquids and provide complete installation and training. The EPA has identified Veeco Metrology as the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement. Veeco Metrology is the manufacturer of the existing Nanoscope III Atomic Force Microscope   and the only source capable of providing this upgrade. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy, the circumstance permitting "Other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302 1 (b) only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s)exist; and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC E105 02), Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711; by fax to (919) 685 3178; or, by email at smith.pamela@epa.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Furnish all supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to construct a new two-story, 4,800 square meter Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) Plant Expansion for the IRS Enterprise Computing Center (ECC) in Kearneysville, WV.  The proposed site is directly adjacent to the Warehouse portion of the IRS ECC in Kearneysville, WV.  Upon completion of construction of the MEP Plant Expansion, the existing MEP Plant operations in the lower level of the Warehouse building will be migrated to the new MEP plant expansion.  The existing MEP space will be abandoned.  The project will involve the phased relocation of the majority of the existing mechanical plant equipment, including replacement boilers, and the replacement of the majority of the existing electrical plant equipment, including a new static UPS system.  The new plant shall be constructed without interruptions or significant reductions of operational redundancy to the existing operations.  	

The project work includes all work necessary for new construction and renovation and includes, but is not limited to work in the following areas: Deep Foundations, Concrete, Structural Steel, Metal Decking, Fireproofing, Masonry, Pre-cast Concrete, Roofing, Drywall, Doors, Windows, Paint, Elevators, HVAC, Plumbing, Fire Protection, Electrical Power, Lighting, Building Automation System, Landscaping and other associated work.  

This is a metric project as drawings and specifications are prepared utilizing metric units.  The approximate duration of the contract is thirty (30) months.  The estimated cost range of this project is “over” ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00), will be a firm fixed price type contract, and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  The successful offeror will be required to utilize GSA’s computer software ePM system (Electronic Project Management) to communicate with the entire team regarding the status of contract administration issues.

A source selection/best value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being more important than price.  

This is an advisory multi-step procurement process.  Consequently the acquisition process shall consist of five phases: 1) receipt and evaluation of Step 1 technical proposals; 2) provide notification to each firm with regards to their technical rating; 3) after providing firms with the 100% construction documents (any firm who submitted a technical proposal under Step 1 will not be precluded at this stage), receipt of Step 2 technical proposals and price proposals; 4) develop a competitive range and conduct interviews; 5) if necessary, upon completion of negotiations, request, receipt and evaluation of final price revisions.   

Initially, offerors will submit their Step 1 technical proposals, consisting of the following technical factors: Past Performance and Key Personnel Qualifications/Organizational Chart.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  After receiving their technical rating, offerors may submit their price proposals and their Step 2 technical proposals, consisting of the following technical factors: Project Management Plan, Subcontractors’ Past Performance, Project Schedule, Construction Alternatives and Subcontracting Methodology.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  Any firm who submitted a Step 1 technical proposal will not be precluded from submitting a Step 2 proposal.  However, a contractor must submit a proposal under Step 1 in order to submit a proposal under Step 2. Next, those offerors included in the competitive range will be interviewed.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The solicitation will be available on or about 10/15/09.  Interested parties may download their own copy of these documents.  These documents will be in .pdf format and may be accessed on a World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.fbo.gov .  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this website for the release of any amendments and to download their own copy of any amendments.  This site provides instructions for downloading the amendment file(s).  

Licensed general contractors are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and seven (7) copies of the required technical and price information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound or 3 ring binder format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors. 

Prior to award of this contract to a large business, an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required in accordance with FAR Part 19, which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: small business concerns (Goal 37%), hubzone small business concerns (Goal 3%), small disadvantaged business concerns (Goal 6%), women-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%), veteran-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%) and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (3%).  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with            FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  This procurement is being solicited through full and open competition procedures under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  The NAICS CODE is 236220.  This synopsis constitutes the synopsis of the Pre-Invitation Notice.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY ACT - BRIDGING DESIGN BUILD RENOVATION PROJECT AT THE PETER W. RODINO FEDERAL BUILDING IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY
<SOLNBR>GS-02P-09-DTC-0018(N)
<ARCHDATE>11162009

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region, Public Buildings Service, Design and Construction Division is pleased to announce an opportunity for the Bridging Design/Build Renovation of the Peter W. Rodino Federal Building located at 970 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey. This procurement is for the selection of a Design/Build team consisting of an architect/engineer (A/E) and a general contractor (GC) to design and construct the modernization project of the Peter W. Rodino Federal Building. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220. The size standard is $33.5 million per year. This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19).
The Peter W. Rodino Federal Building consists of 16 floors, plus basement and subbasement. GSA previously abated and renovated seven (7) of the floors.  Accordingly, the work to be performed on these seven floors will include non-structural seismic upgrades, limited abatement and limited structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing upgrades. The remaining nine (9) floors will be fully modernized as part of this project - work on these floors will consist of full abatement and renovation, including installation of spray-on fireproofing at abated areas, bathroom modernization, alterations to the fire protection, fire alarm, mechanical, electrical, lighting, plumbing and structural framing to support the tenant improvements and improve the overall energy efficiency of the building. The mechanical system upgrades will include replacement of chillers, cooling tower, and pumps, and selective relocation of risers.  The exterior work will include selective roof replacement, repairs to the precast concrete façade and addition of a new glass curtainwall “over-cladding” with supplemental framing and reinforcement of the existing structure.
The modernized floors are expected to result in a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the 2009 baseline and meet the target of 55,000 BTUs/sf and is required to be LEED certified at a minimum, although a LEED silver rating or better is anticipated.
The estimated contract value is $100,000,000.00 to $140,000,000.00. Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just design and/or construction. Contractors should price according to the specifications. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) (Phase 1 Solicitation) is scheduled to be issued on or about October 15, 2009, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). A site-visit for Phase I is tentatively scheduled to be held the week of October 26, 2009, at the Peter W. Rodino Building in Newark, New Jersey to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project and technical evaluation criteria. Attendance is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. GSA intends to contract for complete design and construction services with the bridging design/build contract that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to design and construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.
The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 36.3 Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and Part 15 Source Selection procedures using the Best Value/Trade-off process. Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire design and construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project. The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202); based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The procurement process will be performed in two (2) phases. The technical factors for Phase I Request for Qualifications (RFQ) are tentatively as follows: (#1) Bonding Capacity Requirement (Go/No-Go); (#2) Technical Approach; (#3) Prior Experience on Similar Projects; and (#4) Past Performance on Similar Projects and Safety.  Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a short list of a maximum of five (5) of the most qualified offerors will be selected to further compete in Phase II. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Phase I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s). Phase II Submission: Only firms (Maximum of 5) selected to be on the short list will enter into this phase of the solicitation. These firms will be issued the bridging design documents with the Phase 2 solicitation. Bridging Design documents will include performance specifications, design intent drawings, relevant design guides and standards, as well as specifications relating to project- and building-specific needs.
The technical factors for Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP) are tentatively as follows: (#1) Detailed Organizational Structure, Significant Subcontractor List and Qualifications of Key Personnel; (#2) Project Management Plan; (#3) Oral Presentation; and (#4) Project Labor Agreement.  Price proposals and a Subcontracting Plan (if the offeror is not a small business concern) will also be required during Phase II. This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA's Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (36%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.
All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-02P09-DTC-0018. This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. Reporting requirements from the contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W91215-10-R-0001.<br><br>The Aviation Integration Directorate has a requirement to study the potential of incorporating the technology gained from DARPA's Sandblaster program and inserting the technology in MH-60 and MH-47 Special Operations rotary wing aircraft using existing aircraft sensors and avionics hardware.  The purpose is to evaluate the capability of these existing sensors to support a synthetic flight functionality.  It is the Governments intent to award a sole source contract to Honeywell Aerospace Advanced Technology, 9201 San Mateo Boulevard NE, Albuquerque, NM 87113, CAGE 07187, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2034 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement.  <BR>This functionality allows pilots with a real-time three dimensional display of flight routes, surrounding airspace, approaches and improved or unimproved landing zones in degraded visual environment conditions. The Government does not possess any technical data to provide to support this analysis or to support full and open competition.  The Honeywell Sandblaster technologies have already been demonstrated in an Army UH-60 aircraft.  Use of another source for purposes of this study would require substantial duplication of cost to the Government. NAICS is 334511, small business size standard is 750. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This announcement will close 15 October 2009. <BR>

North Units: Turn west off of Hwy 200 MP 40 onto Big Beaver  FS road #152. Travel 5.5 miles and turn left onto FS road #301. Continue for 3.9 miles and turn left onto FS road #2720.  There is a gate approximately 100 feet from the junction.  It is 1.2 miles to the first unit and 2.4 to the last.

South Units: Turn west off of Hwy 200 at MP 44, onto Little Beaver Creek FS road #1741.  Travel approximately 1.9 miles and turn left on FS road #300.  There is a gate approximately 550 feet from the junction.  It is one mile to the first Take Off Point, (TOP #1), which is at the second switchback.  By foot, the Contract Area is a quarter mile walk to the west.  You can continue on 300 for another mile to TOP #2.  From this point the Contract Area is one third of a mile to the northwest on foot.

Access Restrictions: (Refer to the Project Area / Accessibility Map) 

Between October 25th and November 8th, there will be NO vehicle access behind the gates on FS roads 2720 and 301.  From November 9th through November 29th vehicle access will not be permitted on weekends.  Access on gated roads requires a permit which can be obtained at the Cabinet District.

The 2720 road that accesses the northern portion of the project area has a yearlong travel restriction.  This road has a locked gate and requires an access permit, obtainable at the district office, prior to entry.  A walk-in from the 2720 road is required to view treatment units 20, 20A, 20B, 21, 22 and 23 during vehicle restriction times.  

The 2720 road is a narrow road with some steep pitches, once snow/ice covered, access will be limited to ATV or walk-in only.

The southern portion of the project area is accessed from FS Road 301 as shown on the Project Area / Accessibility Map.  A walk-in is required from the take off points to view treatment units and required system road construction.   DNRC roads shown on the map are currently under construction and will be gated once construction is complete, public access will be prohibited

After October 15, 2009, FS Road 301 will be gated and locked at the junction of FS Road 1741.

The southern area has a large amount of dead and down Lodgepole pine that will impede foot access.

Introduction

This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Radiology Center (RC) for a four-year continuation of the multi-center Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).  The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through studies of human lung tissues. The LTRC facilitates histopathological and molecular research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium.  Collections of specimens are linked to extensive individual, clinical, and phenotypic data.  This consortium is currently comprised of four Clinical Centers (CCs), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), a Radiology Center (RC), and a center that serves as the Tissue Repository (TR).  

Project Requirements

The RC will 1) maintain and update LTRC protocols related to chest x-ray computed tomographic (CT) image acquisition, processing and transmission; 2) train and certify CC personnel involved in CT imaging and transmission of images to the RC; 3) conduct site visits to CCs as needed to ensure compliance with LTRC protocols; 4) establish and maintain a tracking system for the receipt and analysis of CT images; 5) assist the CCs in de-identifying and transmitting CT images to the RC; 6) maintain an archive of CT images; 7) perform diagnostic analysis of each CT image by a board-certified radiologist; 8) transmit a written report of any significant abnormalities found to the DCC and to the CC from which the image originated; 9) analyze each CT image to obtain quantitative and/or semi-quantitative measures of lung disease; 10) transmit de-identified CT images to researchers as directed by the DCC; and 11) work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication.  The Principal Investigator of the RC participates fully in the activities of the Steering Committee that manages overall operations of the LTRC.

<DESC>This sources-sought synopsis is issued in anticipation of a futureprocurement program. Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research todetermine contractor interest and capability to produce a new product called theCountermeasure, Anti-Torpedo (CAT).  The CAT consists of the Anti-TorpedoTorpedo (ATT) and its associated All Up Round Equipment (AURE).   ATT is being developed by Applied Research Laboratory, Penn State University(ARL PSU) and Naval Surface Warfare Command, Indian Head Division (NSWC IHD).The AURE is being developed by Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport Divisionand SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego.  The development includes generation oftechnical data that will allow potential production contractors to bid a "buildto print" design or be offered as GFI to a production contract with anassociated performance specification.  The ATT is divided into five Major Modules: Nose:  The Nose includes an acoustic array and array processing; Warhead:  TheWarhead includes safe and arm electronics; Guidance and Control:  Guidance andControl includes electronics and the thermal battery; Power Plant:  The Power Plant includes a lithium based Stored Chemical EnergyPropulsion System (SCEPS) Engine, reduction gear, a number of Electro-ExplosiveDevices for Engine start up and propulsion electronics; Tail Section:  The TailSection contains control surfaces, Propulsor and electronics for interface tothe ship's weapon system.  There are two propulsion systems and two warhead variants planned.  The primaryvariants will be for the production system as described above, and a smallerquantity of exercise variants of each will be produced.  The propulsion system for the exercise variant will be replaced with anelectric/battery motor, and the warhead will be replaced with an electronicspackage.  The objective of this new development is to field a hard killcountermeasure for surface ship torpedo defense.   The future procurement mayresult in the award of a single prime contract at the CAT level or multiplecontracts at the major module levels described above. If multiple contracts areawarded at the major module level, government acceptance testing would berequired at the module level.  Final integration with the other modules would beperformed at the contractor's facility, a government owned facility that iscontractor operated (GOCO) or a government owned and operated facility (GOGO).  The tactical warhead production is planned to be at NSWC IHD and will besupplied to the integrator as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  Part of the'build to print' technical design work for the ATT is to provide  built-in-testand test equipment for both the major module level and CAT level to allow selloff at either level, as well as final test at the CAT level.  It also allows forlife cycle support of the weapon.  The Government Furnished Information (GFI)for the test equipment will be included in the Technical Data Package for eithera single contractor or multiple contractors at the major module level.  The ATT software is being developed and will be maintained by ARL PSU.   Configuration management of the "build to print" modules/system will bejointly maintained by the contractor(s) and government (via ARL PSU).Engineering Development Models and Prototypes will not be part of the productioncontractor(s) responsibility.  The development of the EDM will includeengineering changes during development to reflect correction of issues foundduring environmental testing, insensitive munitions testing and the in watertest program.    The last EDM built by ARL PSU is planned to be identical to thetechnical data package issued for LRIP.  The scope of this potential program currently is approximately 110 ATT LRIPunits and 1500 Production units.  The second phase of this program is in theplanning stages which may double the number of production units.   The government is also looking at other applications for the ATT which mayexpand its market further.  No FMS sales are anticipated at this time.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary that does notexceed five (5) pages in length describing Production capability and theirexperience with similar items.  The capability summary should explicitly stateif they are interested in the single prime production contractor role or themajor module level prime production role.  Contractors interested in becoming a single prime contractor for the CAT shoulddiscuss their strategies for teaming with subcontractors and successes that havebeen achieved in this area for similar contract actions.  Contractors interested in single major module production or multiple majormodule production should explicitly state which areas they are interested inmanufacturing and focus their discussion on their capability to build thesemodules.  The discussion should include recent relevant business experience andtheir planned approach to meet the requirements stated above.  Specifically,firms should discuss their past success with "Build to Print" contracts andrelevant experience where higher level integration is required after delivery oftheir assemblies.  If the contractor has experience with similar systems thatwere not "build to print", inclusion of this information in the report is alsodesired.  Responses should include: (a) The name and address of the contractor and where the CAT would be built; (b) Point of contact including name, title, phone, and email addresses; (c) A description of similar or like complexity devices currently offered by thecontractor that meet, or with minor modifications might meet, some or all thelisted requirements. Where to submit: Email responses or inquiries should be sent to Rana Movahed,rana.movahed@navy.mil. To help ensure proper receipt, please place the word"CAT"in the subject field of your e-mail correspondence. Information may also be sentto the following address: Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attention RanaMovahed Code 02622M 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE Stop 2050, Washington Navy Yard,DC 20376-2050.

<SOLNBR>TPFDD-RTB
<RESPDATE>100909
<CONTACT>Randy Dreyer, Email Randy.Dreyer@disa.mil
<DESC><p><br />1. Introduction: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources for technical and development support to satisfy a need for the development of the Rapid Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) Builder (RTB) tool as part of the Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) environment. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives to determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the RTB tool. Industry responses will be used by the government to assess feasibility, technical solutions, and acquisition approaches for this request. The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>Background: APEX is the Department of Defense's methodology for constructing timely and agile war plans that achieve national security objectives. Currently the Department of Defense has several operational capabilities and systems that provide functionality to support the APEX business process. The RTB is a proposed capability that has been identified by the Joint Staff as necessary to field a robust and enhanced APEX capability throughout the Department of Defense. RTB will be a web-based technology that:</p>
<p>A. Provides the capability to create a plan with Plan Identification (PID).<br />B. Identifies the forces for that plan.<br />C. Develops a campaign plan processing the time phased force and civil support flow data for DoD transportation required for OCONUS operation and CONUS/domestic Emergency Support Functions (ESF).<br />D. Assists the Combatant Commanders and their Service Components and DoD joint activities in day-to-day operations, and crisis action and contingency planning<br />E. Allows geographically disperse staffs to conduct collaborative Campaign Planning, to produce a strategic movement plan including the TPFDD.<br />F. Interfaces with the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) to access data.</p>
<p>The DISA APEX PMO is responsible for providing adaptive planning and execution/force projection capabilities that will be accessible in a net-centric environment and will focus on providing the joint forces commander with the data and information needed to make timely, effective, and informed decisions. The APEX strategy will provide new capabilities as well as evolve current disparate planning capabilities into a fully integrated, interoperable, and collaborative joint solution. The APEX capability will provide functionality to support dynamic campaign planning, forecast predictions, information management, and rapid execution for both deliberate and crisis action planning. The DISA APEX PMO is responsible for the development/modernization, integration, testing, and fielding of APEX enterprise capabilities for the Warfighter on the Global Information Grid (GIG).</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Tissue Repository (TR) for a four-year continuation of the multi-center Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).  The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through studies of human lung tissues. The LTRC facilitates histopathological and molecular research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Collections of specimens are linked to extensive, individual clinical and phenotypic data.  This consortium is currently comprised of four Clinical Centers (CCs), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), a Radiology Center (RC), and a center that serves as the Tissue Repository (TR).  

Project Requirements

The TR will 1) maintain and update LTRC protocols for specimen procurement, processing, transport, storage, and distribution; 2) train CC personnel regarding specimen handling, processing, and shipping to the TR; 3) conduct site visits as needed to assure that LTRC protocol procedures are followed; 4) perform quality control/quality assurance tests and report results to the DCC, including assays of RNA integrity; 5) process, aliquot, and store specimens received; 6) perform diagnostic, light-microscopic, histopathological analyses of lung tissues by a board-certified pathologist; 7) transmit a written report of diagnoses and any significant abnormalities found to the DCC and to the CC from which the tissue originated; 8) prepare and distribute specimens and collections of specimens to researchers, including microtome preparation of tissue slices; 9) coordinate with the DCC to maintain an accurate inventory of specimens, and 10) work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication. The Principal Investigator of the TR participates fully in the activities of the Steering Committee that manages overall operations of the LTRC.

<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the intention to competitively award a Task Order from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 38. The period of performance will be from November 1, 2009 though March 26, 2010.</p>
<p>This requirement is for contractor performance of a phase I and phase II Environmental Site Assessment. In planning this phase I and II ESA, the contractor shall utilize information from all previously completed workplans, investigations and cleanups, performed by Intermet and their consultants. The phase II ESA shall consider recommendations in the Phase II RFI work plan, address data gaps and, as necessary (based on input from EPA and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ)), address other areas, including Solid Waste Management Units and Areas of Concern within this 85 acre area for which EPA has obtained access. The general objective of the phase II ESA is to perform all characterization efforts (including collection/analysis of environmental samples, evaluation of results and preparation of a report) necessary to determine the nature/extent groundwater and soil contamination and additional cleanup efforts which may be required by EPA/VDEQ.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDERS ONLY. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CALL OR E-MAIL.</strong></span></p>

<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDER. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</p>

<DESC>Special Notice - Intent to Sole Source:
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Coast Guard Training Center Cape May, NJ intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Gold Type Business Machines (GTBM), 351 Paterson Avenue, East Rutherford, NJ 07073 for the purchase of software services for Info-Cop and Polisys a comprehensive and integrated single-solution platform that offers CAD, RMS, and full mobile computing. This purchase will be made under simplified acquisition for Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 13.106(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  GTBM is the local source that can provide the necessary software and service to meet the government’s requirement for the combination of these services.  This is the local source found that will enable two applications into one instead of two separate systems and use of remote server.  No additional hardware costs are necessary since the hardware server environment will be based on a central virtual server housed at a secure facility elsewhere.  These subscriptions will allow USCG TRACEN Police to access critical information from NCIC, NJ ATS, NJ AOC, DMV, BMV, MVC and provide notification of prior citations, incidents, weapons involvement and keep organized track of all data needed for processing statistics.  All shall be maintained on a secure offsite server that keeps a constant update so no communication is lost by members of the Department between shifts.  Info-Cop is the most widely used source of information utilized by other local New Jersey federal, state, and county law enforcement thus allowing the USCG to communicate with these other local agencies to share law enforcement information.  The anticipated award date is 14 October 2009. The period of performance for this requirement is from time of award through September 30, 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation for offers. There is no solicitation package available. However, all proposals received within five (5) days of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding in writing via e-mail only to Shirley.L.Green@uscg.mil. Responses must provide clear and concise documentation displaying an offerors bona fide capability to provide these items. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Responses may be submitted via email; total file size shall be less than 2MB. All information submitted should support the offerors capability to provide the items required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>Authority: Full and Open Competition
<p>Anticipated Award Date: 01 Aug 2010</p>
<p>PURCHASE KC135 ATS SUPPORT. SOL FA8223-10-R-50094 : This is the official announcement for KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS) support. Pre-solicitation information and a substantial body of data associated with this procurement were publicized at FedBizOps under pre-solicitation notice FA8223-10-R-135TS. The final RFP with attachments and worksheets will be posted 15 days after the date of this Synopsis.</p>
<p>This will be an acquisition of services, follow-on to the support previously acquired under the long term contract, F33657-91-C-0072 with Flight Safety Services Corp which is scheduled to expire 30 Sep 2010. The period of performance to be priced will be ten (10) years, with a base period from 01 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 (FY 2011), and subsequent option years that if exercised, will carry the contract through 30 Sep 2020.</p>
<p>The KC-135 Simulator System is comprised of 19 KC-135 Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs), 2 Boom Operator Weapons System Trainers (BOWSTs), 27 GATM Interactive Hand Controller (IHC) Part Task Trainers (GIPTT), 11 Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) in various configurations, 400 Computer Based Training (CBT) Workstations and laptops, 25 AFMSS desktop trainers, 30 Instructor trainer laptops, 1 Cargo Loading Trainer, and courseware. Devices and Instructional Material (courseware) are utilized at the main training facility, Altus AFB, and at twelve (12) other bases in the CONUS and OCONUS area. Two are OCONUS, Kadena and Mildenhall. A training facility at Hickam, Hawaii will be in operation in the 3rd quarter of FY2011, replacing operations at Grand Forks, ND, as a result of BRAC re-alignments.</p>
<p>The KC-135 ATS is a broadly scoped, active and dynamic performance based services program providing initial qualification and re-qualification KC-135 training to Pilots, Boom Operators and Instructors. Operation, maintenance and modification of devices, and maintenance of courseware, often driven by the mandate to maintain training concurrent with the aircraft, contribute to this dynamic. A very active operations tempo (large numbers of students) and impetus to move more training from the aircraft to the ATS/simulator also contributes to challenges faced by this program.</p>
<p>Key objectives of the program include:<br />1. Initial, continuation, and requalification training for KC-135 aircrew. Aircrews include pilots, navigators, and boom operators. <br />2. Maintaining the training devices and courseware concurrent to the current KC-135 aircraft baseline. <br />3. Support other modifications as required via ECPs. <br />4. Provide facility management. <br />5. Provide Program Management including Systems Engineering, Quality Assurance, Data/Configuration Management, and ESOH management.</p>
<p>To meet objective for small business participation in Air Force Trainer programs, large businesses who expect to submit offers under this program must commit to expanded small business participation, as will be explained in Section H of the RFP.</p>
<p>A firm fixed price, non-commercial, full and open competition services contract is contemplated. Line Item summary description is as follows:</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend the performance period of contract NNA05BE29C with L-3Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC. on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  A modification reflecting this extension will beissued to extend the period of performance up to seven additional months, consisting ofone four-month base period followed by three one-month option periods.The current contractor provides mission critical aircraft services for aircraftoperations, maintenance and research at NASA Ames Research Center, as well as operationof the Moffett Federal Airfield.  These services will support research, technicalinvestigations, scientific studies, airworthiness activities, flight operations and safeand efficient operation of the Federal Airfield.  The services required involve thefollowing technical areas: mechanical systems, electrical/electronics systems,instrumentation, software and data systems to support NASA Ames Research Center.  The purpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of thecurrent contract and the anticipated award of the competitive follow-on requirement.  Theextension will extend the period of performance for up to seven additional months, andincrease the contract value of the current contract, NNA05BE29C.  The seven additionalmonths include one four-month base period (from November 1, 2009, through February 28,2010) followed by three one-month option periods, if exercised.  The total contractperformance period, including extension, remains under five years.  The currentcontractor, L-3 is considered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs given thetechnical expertise of the contractor and short performance period for the extension. Awarding a seven-month contract to another source would result in substantial duplicationof costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements and notallow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services andcausing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.	Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested parties may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact nolater 4:00PM PST on October 16, 2009.  Such capabilities and qualifications will beevaluated solely for the purposes of determining whether or not conduct this procurementon a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposedeffort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, issolely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in responses to this notice.  Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via e-mail to Veronica Llamas at Veronica.Llamas-1@nasa.govAn Ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs link below.Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available athttp://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/eis_apt.cgi

<DESC>Upper Truckee River
Stream Channel Restoration Analysis and Design Project 

The USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU), South Lake Tahoe, California, is seeking a qualified consultant to provide professional services to develop final (100%) design plans (i.e., engineering plans with specifications) from the existing 50% designs to restore Reach 5 of the Upper Truckee River. The consultant will be responsible for incorporating the comments received on the 50% design plans into the final designs, for obtaining design information about the upstream and downstream channel restoration projects to ensure compatibility, and for validating and/or revising the designs by comparing them with a reference channel reach. The project is located in El Dorado County and is accessible from Elks Club Drive at the junction with Highway 50.

The Watershed

The Upper Truckee River watershed is approximately 54 square miles in size. Elevations in the watershed range from 6,224 ft at the rivers mouth at Lake Tahoe to approximately 10,000 feet. The project area consists of a floodplain meadow formed along a low gradient portion of the lower Upper Truckee River watershed. 

Project Location

The upstream end of the project site is a few thousand feet below the Highway 50 crossing at Elks Club Drive. The project reach (Reach 5) extends from that location, near the southeast corner of the Lake Tahoe Airport runway, to approximately 8,000 feet downstream to the US Forest Service property boundary. 

Scope of Work

Professional and technical services shall include all labor, materials, equipment, and facilities, as required to conduct the analysis for design, to be the basis for the development of engineering plans and specifications. The contractor, the LTBMU Stream Restoration Group, and a California Tahoe Conservancy (CTC) representative will function as a team, accomplished through field meetings, office meetings, and email communication.

COMPONENTS OF THE ANALYSIS FOR DESIGN SHOULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
	Soils, meadow soil stratification, and vegetation characterization	Implementation constraints (including wildlife habitat and vegetation communities present, public utilities, and property boundaries)
	Assessment of appropriate channel substrate material (for channel bed and banks)
	Preliminary design validation 
	Assessment of local functional analogue channel. 
	Multiple reach unsteady flow flood hydraulic analysis.


COMPONENTS OF DESIGN PLAN DEVELOPMENT SHOULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
	Hydraulic and geomorphic synopsis
	Geomorphically compatible tie-ins to the existing channel both upstream and downstream of the project reach
	Incorporation of aquatic habitat features
	Meadow revegetation as part of site rehabilitation
	Plans and specifications 

The work to be performed by the consultant shall consist of, but is not limited to, the following items and sub-items:

1.	USFS coordination. A USFS restoration hydrologist and a representative from the CTC will be part of the consultant’s design team from the analysis for design through final project design. There will be bi-monthly coordination among the design team, as needed, regarding the progress and status of the project and related issues through meetings or personal communications.

2.	Other coordination meetings. Three additional coordination meetings will be required before completing the 75% design plans, with; 1) the preparers of the 50% plans, 2) the South Tahoe Public Utility District; and 3) the upstream and downstream project teams.

3.	Analysis for design and design report. A professional memo that summarizes all analyses and conclusions described in the Components of the Analysis for Design section above, and any other analyses developed during contract negotiation and/or during the assessment phase of the contract and agreed upon by both USFS Restoration Staff and the contractor.

4.	Preparation of Design Plans and Specifications. Project designs shall emphasize the use of passive watershed or bioengineering methods and approaches, and shall also incorporate details/specifications for the utility line crossings (approved by STPUD) and crossings over the existing channel alignment, which may require more hardened engineered structures. Design plans shall be stamped and signed by a civil engineer registered in California. Final plans shall be detailed to the degree necessary that they can be used for construction drawings (main sheets at standard engineering scale) and shall include, at a minimum, a cover sheet, location map, legend, abbreviation list, general notes, plan and profile sheets, cross sections, details, temporary erosion control, land capability, revegetation specifications, bioengineering techniques, land disturbance calculations, soil excavation quantity calculations, and in-stream structures. Plans shall also show the location of construction and maintenance access and haul roads, staging and storage areas. 

5.	Construction Support Documents Memo. This memo includes technical specifications that shall include, at a minimum, description of items to purchase and materials specification, quantities of cut and fill, order of work, types of equipment to be used, all procedures and equipment for purchasing, installing, and maintaining all BMPs. Since the project requires a phased approach for implementation, the contract documents shall reflect this. The consultant shall also provide a final engineer’s construction cost estimate for each phase and for the project in total.

6.	Field Reviews. The consultant shall lead 2 field reviews of the project, one at the 75% design phase with the USFS, CTC, Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, TRPA, LRWQCB, League to Save Lake Tahoe, Army Corps of Engineers, and other members of the project Technical Advisory Group. The second field review shall be for the Forest Leadership Team (FLT): Forest Supervisor, Deputy Forest Supervisor, and Staff Officers.

7.	Attendance at agency/organization meetings. 
This includes three meetings, at the onset of the contract, and at the 75% and 90% phases of project design.

Please contact MAJ Brad Willcockson for a complete meal description of this meal including required portions.<BR><BR>The sample meal will be served from 1100 to 1200 on Thursday, 22 October 2009, in the Gymnasium/Auditorium of the Helena Armed Forces Reserve Center building, or other alternate location, on Fort Harrison, MT. Vendors may have access to the serving area between 1000 and 1300, to allow time for set-up and break-down. The vendor is responsible for the entire set-up and break-down of their serving line, including trash removal. No services (power, ice, or water) will be provided to the vendors. The government will provide an eating area with tables and chairs for the diners.<BR><BR>To make evaluation of several food vendors possible, vendors will serve only small (sample) portions to the evaluators. The serving sample size will be determined by the number of vendor<BR>participants. For example, if five vendors are competing, each vendor will adjust their serving size to one fifth normal size, so that after sampling food from five vendors each evaluator will have consumed one normal sized meal.<BR><BR>For each FULL portion served, participating vendors will receive $9.06, which is the maximum BDFA permitted to be paid by the federal government. For example, if thirty students participate in the sample meal, with five vendors serving, each student would pay $9.06 (for a total of $271.80), and each vendor would serve six FULL portion meals and be entitled to 6 x $9.06, or $54.36. The actual number of participants will be given to the vendors prior to the event.   <BR><BR>Payment to vendors for the sample meal will be made partially in cash and partially by Visa. Vendors must be willing to accept government credit card payments.  <BR><BR>The maximum the government will accept as a quote on this requirement is $6.18 per breakfast, $9.06 per lunch, and $13.59 per dinner, which is the maximum BDFA the government may pay. Quotes in excess of BDFA will be considered non-responsive.<BR><BR>Quality Assurance: The government shall develop and provide to the selected a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) incorporating the same factors used in source selection that monitors all service activities and ensures delivery of the high quality food services. The government will periodically evaluate the contractors performance in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, which may include AAR (After Action Review) input from students using numerical evaluation factors similar to those used in source selection. Receipt of student evaluations from students showing less that a 90% satisfaction rating will be deemed an adverse report on quality, and will be considered by the COR is assessing overall quality of performance. In consideration of quality assessments, the Montana Army National Guard may, in its sole judgment - and in addition to remedies available to it for contract default - unilaterally terminate the awarded contract for convenience by giving the Awardee vendor 30 days notice of its desire to terminate. In such case, no termination charges will be awarded, and the requirement may be immediately re-solicited and the services of another vendor obtained. <BR><BR> The contractor shall also ensure the requirements of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and applicable Federal regulations are met.<BR><BR>Special Qualifications:  Contractor must maintain appropriate credentialing files on all employees to include, but not limited to, licensure/certification as a food handler/server, and current registration with the department of health. All food service providers must be a licensed caterer in the State of Montana.<BR><BR>This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.<BR><BR>Provisions:<BR><BR>The provision of  52.212-3 Alt I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (April 2002) applies to this RFQ.   52.212-3 Alt I clause needs to be completed and a signed copy of this provision shall be submitted with any offer.  <BR><BR>52.212-2, Evaluation-- Commercial Items (January 1999).

Factor 1:  CORPORATE EXPERIENCECorporate experience refers to the experience acquired by a corporation as a whole, as opposed to the experience of individual firm members. The offeror shall demonstrate relevant corporate experience.  Relevant corporate experience is experience, which, either individually or in the aggregate, (within the past five years) is directly related to or similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the PWS attached hereto  For purposes of this evaluation, relevancy in scope, magnitude and complexity are measured by the following: 
Scope:  Experience in the areas defined in the Performance Work Statement (performing facility condition assessments (FCA) in a hospital environment identifying and prioritizing facility maintenance and repair requirements.	
Magnitude and complexity  Is the measure of similarity of technical and managerial intricacy and required coordination of efforts and disciplines that exists between the PWS/SOW and the vendor's performance on other contracts.  For complexity, not only will the tasks performed be considered, but also the vendor's ability to coordinate the tasks (e.g. concurrent facility assessments at multiple sites and geographical locations.)
Vendors shall provide up to THREE (3) specific projects performed by their firm, or a critical subcontractor or teaming contractor, completed within the past five (5) years (yet to be performed work or experience prior to the last five years will not be considered) that are most relevant to performing facility condition assessments (FCA) in a hospital environment identifying and prioritizing facility maintenance and repair requirements, as set forth in the attached PWS, as follows: 
a.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience developing specific solutions for defective conditions identified during assessments with regard to Joint Commission Environment of Care standards.b.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience in prioritizing maintenance and repair work based on the assessments and understanding of facility equipment and component failure rates and the risk associated with deficiencies identified in assessments.c.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience in providing data management, detailed reports, recommendations and estimates based on those assessments.
Vendors shall provide the following information for each specific example listed:
1.	Contract number and title2.	Brief description of work performed including type of facilities assessed and required reports.3.	Period of performance4.	Total size (in SF/SM of area) of facilities assessed5.	Dollar value (per year)6.	Location7.	References (Name, Current telephone)8.	Detailed explanation demonstrating s how the listed contract examples are relevant in experience to the requested work.
Note: If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the relevant reference, the percentage of work to be performed by the referenced subcontractor under this contract shall be provided.  Subcontractor experience will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the quote submitted.  It is also noted that the references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow vendors who may not have the same scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual project to still be considered acceptable if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references above. 

Factor 2:  TECHNICAL APPROACH
This factor considers the effectiveness of the vendor's organization and approach that will satisfy all of the requirements of the contract, including Quality Control.  The Government seeks a comprehensive and effective approach that will maximize quality, be cost effective, and result in identifying, prioritizing and estimating facility maintenance and repair requirements for BUMED assets.  The vendor shall submit a detailed work plan  describing their technical approach, work plan and contract management strategy, which addresses the following:
a.	Provide a proposed organizational chart that demonstrates the flow of authority, responsibility, and communication between home office staff, the on site personnel providing the assessments, and organizational relationships with any proposed subcontractors.b.	Indicate how you will plan, schedule, coordinate, monitor and perform worldwide assessments.c.	Provide job descriptions for personnel you plan on using to perform assessments and a resume for the proposed Program/Project Manager.  Based on your proposed schedule, provide the number and type of personnel you will use during the period of performance for the assessments.  Describe how you will provide the staffing and equipment needed to perform this contract.  Describe your ability to maintain program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional employees worldwide.d.	Indicate how you will assure quality assessments, accurate estimates, etc.  Submit a separate document \, outlining your firms internal quality assurance / quality control procedures for both technical / field work and report production.e.

PART III.  PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Attachment I, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire shall be submitted for each project included under Factor 1, Corporate experience.  Ensure that correct phone numbers and e-mail addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed Past Performance Questionnaires are to be sent from the client via e-mail or fax directly to the Government, and shall not be submitted via the vendor or its team members. Completed questionnaires shall be emailed to jean.1.mann@navy.mil or faxed to (757)322-4166. 
EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following criteria shall be used to evaluate quotes: Corporate Experience, Technical Approach, Price and Past Performance.
(b) A written order in response to the vendor's quotation will be e-mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor.  The Contracting Officer may ask the vendor to provide written acceptance of an order.  In other circumstances the vendor may indicate acceptance by proceeding with the services ordered.
Quotations will be evaluated in two Phases as follows:
a) In Phase I, Part I, Factor I, Corporate Experience shall be evaluated.  The Government will evaluate corporate experience to determine if the vendor has demonstrated relevant experience in performing facility condition assessments in acute care hospital/clinic/medical research facilities similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to the work in the PWS.  
If Corporate Experience is found to be unacceptable, the quote will be determined to be technically unacceptable and will no longer be considered for further evaluation or award.
b) In Phase II, the vendor's Technical Approach, Price submission, and Past Performance will be evaluated.
PART I -Factor 2:  TECHNICAL APPROACH
The Government will evaluate the vendor's technical approach to rate the vendor's understanding of the work to be performed, and their ability to staff, plan, schedule and coordinate worldwide assessments, and to maintain the facility software database in accordance with the requirements of the PWS.  
Note:  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to exclude vendors whose technical submittals have been determined to be unacceptable from further evaluation of price and past performance. 
PART II:  PRICE
The vendor's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.  
Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.  
Note: In the event a vendor submits a technically acceptable quotation with a non-competitive, high price when compared to the government estimate and/or other technically acceptable quotations, the Government, at its discretion, may not evaluate that vendor's past performance submission and eliminate that vendor's quotation from further evaluation and consideration for award.  
PART III:  PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance will be evaluated after the Contracting Officer has completed the technical and price evaluation.  The Government will determine whether the vendor's past performance submissions are, in order of preference, relevant, somewhat relevant or not-relevant projects, based on three factors: scope, complexity and magnitude.  
Relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of all three factors.Somewhat relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of some of the three factors.Not-relevant - the past performance submission fails to meet the criteria of all three factors.For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the vendor on the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The vendor acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the vendor fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Vendors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government, including Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS).
The Government will evaluate the vendor's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a vendor's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  
The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.
SELECTION
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Subpart 13.1.  The Government shall select the vendor whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other criteria (technical submission and past performance) when compared to other quotations.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced vendor.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government. 
Please direct questions to Jean Mann at (757) 322-4662 or jean.l.mann@navy.mil
Vendor(s) must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>1. The LRU/SRU list in Table 1 was updated to remove the items for which<br />we did not possess any technical data. We inadvertently did not correct the<br />listing on page 3. This has been corrected in the attached Purchase<br />Description.
<p>2. CLIN 0003 will only come into play if, in the contractor's technical<br />proposal, it is determined that an upgrade to the GeoTest TS-217 is required<br />to support the LRUs and SRUs in Table 3. If an upgrade is not determined to<br />be necessary, then an option for CLIN 0003 will not be necessary. If it is<br />necessary, 309 EMXG will perform an engineering assessment to determine if<br />the upgrade is technically acceptable. It will be evaluated based on that<br />technical acceptability and the contractor's understanding of what will be<br />required to make the existing and new test stations legal with the upgrade<br />(i.e. coordination with AFMETCAL, PMEL and 565 CBSS as well the required<br />technical documentation updates).</p>

The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has a requirement for the purchase and installation of a Three Ton Bridge Crane.  The project is located at S.O. Conte Anadromous Fish Laboratory, Tturners Falls, Massachusetts.  The Government anticipates award of a Commercial, Firm Fixed Price type contract.

The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on the internet on or about 10/06/2009.

This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333923 and the size standard is 500 employees.  The magnitude of the construction is between $25,000 and $100,000.  There is no incumbent contractor.
Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by resultant contract award(s) may utilize funds provided by the Act.  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements by the successful offeror(s), will be required in any resultant contract.
All questions and concerns may be submitted to the Contracting Officer via email at mfritts@usgs.gov.(ATN # DM0039)

<p>First, several offerors have asked for additional information; based on the fact that Mesa Machine is a dealer, a further identification was requested to identify which machine (grinder) they based their offer on.</p>
<p>The Air Force's technical evaluation and Mesa Machinery Services, Inc's compliance report were based upon an Aldridge Grinding Machine Company's Model ES-346CS, Grinding Machine (Huntsville, Alabama, USA).<br />Second, we cannot advise anyone who are seeking to provide subcontracting services under this contract; rather, this would have to be done directly with our prime contractor Mesa Machinery Services, Inc. out of Estero, FL.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES<br />CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
<p>FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION<br />RELATIVE TO USE OF A LABOR HOUR CONTRACT<br />(IAW FAR 16.601(c))<br />RFP 2008-N-10241</p>
<p>FINDINGS:</p>
<p>I. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), have a requirement for Management Consultants and Technical Assistance from the MASO Office.</p>
<p>A. Because the nature of the work for management consultants and technical assistance involves varied labor categories and support, it is not possible to project with certainty how long it will take to perform the required services and associated tasks. For this reason a fixed price contract is not a suitable contract type. The work is also not susceptible to a cost reimbursement contract for the same reason - the extent of support is not sufficiently definable to allow negotiation of an estimated cost and associated fixed fee.<br /><br />B.

<DESC>Utility privatization is a joint Army and Defense Energy Support Center
(DESC) effort to privatize the water and wastewater utility infrastructure at Fort
Meade, Maryland.  Privatization is the total divestiture of a utility system through the transfer and conveyance of the installation's utility infrastructure assets in conjunction with and for the purpose of the conveyee providing utility distribution services on a long-term basis. The successful conveyee assumes ownership, operation, maintenance, and repair of the previously Government-owned utility system infrastructure.

The privatization process includes: (1) the sale of the utility infrastructure; (2) the acquisition of utility services on the privatized system(s); and (3) the granting of an easement. The sale of the utility infrastructure is a property disposal action, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2688, which is not covered under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The acquisition of utility service, which is covered by the FAR, takes place in conjunction with the sale of the utility infrastructure. These are two separate actions that are contingent upon one another and take place at the same time.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2688, conveyance of the system(s) may occur when the long-term economic benefit of the U.S. Government exceeds the long-term economic cost.

<AWARDEE>Accenture LLP, 11951 Freedom Drive, Reston, VA 20190-5640 US
<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS POST-AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO Accenture LLP for the reasons described below.  In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice of issuance of modification 0036 to task order 0006 of Accenture LLP’s Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the Internal Revenue Service’s Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Program.  The TIPSS-3 Program is a multiple agency contract that provides sources of information processing to the Department of Treasury, its Bureaus, and other federal agencies.  The TIPSS indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.504, provide for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies of services during a fixed period.  Each task order placed against the IDIQ contract specifies a definitive requirement or quantity and delivery date. 

The initial task order was competed amongst the twenty-one TIPSS-3 contractors, which consist of large and small businesses, and was awarded to Accenture LLP to provide Integrated Customer Communication Environment (ICCE) full life cycle support.  The task order was awarded on a cost reimbursement basis due to the volatility of the work, which could not be fully defined as required for the use of a fixed price structure.  The ICCE system provides direct interface with the taxpayer and tax preparer via telephone services and internet.  The scope of the task order provides integrated customer communication environment support; including requirements analysis, design, documentation, coding, unit and integration testing, implementation support, post-implementation support and project management support.  The scope of support also includes integration of all customer contact and call center systems.   The task order was used to accomplish ARRA work related to ICCE call center messaging and menu changes since the task order represented the most efficient means of accomplishing the work within schedule (prior to the 2009 tax filing season). 

The Government will issue an administrative modification to realign a portion of the funding for the task order to cover messaging and menu changes in support of the ARRA work.   ARRA funds had not been apportioned to the program at the execution of the task order award; therefore, the ARRA work was initially performed using other than ARRA funding.  The administrative modification is being issued to Accenture LLP against the existing task order.

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate an additional $34,535.46 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site.<br />The general requirement of this work is to have the contractor is to review previous work performed at this site and conduct a Tier II site investigation. The site is located on the northeast corner of Cheyenne Avenue and 4th Street in Lame Deer, Montana on the Northern Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDER. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</strong></span></p>

<AWARDEE>CHEMONICS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
<DESC><p>USAID/Peru's Second Generation Poverty Reduction and Alleviation Program (PRA II) Started: Following a Full-and-Open Competition USAID signed&nbsp;on september 28, 2009&nbsp;a five-year, $13.4 million contract with Chemonics to implement PRA II, a follow-on to the highly successful PRA activity that helped Peruvian micro, small and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) generate $300 million in sales, 82,000 new jobs, and $20 million worth of investment in 13 economic corridors in Peru over a five-year period. The PRA model identifies high-value markets, provides strategic business development services that link MSMEs to these markets, and stimulates private and public investments to support these value chains. <br /><br />PRA II will provide similar services in eight economic corridors where poverty is deeply entrenched and constraints to economic growth are greatest, focusing in the Andean highlands. The program's goals are to increase the sales of goods and services produced by MSMEs receiving USAID assistance by $90 million, generate 27,000 new jobs, and leverage $15 million in public-private alliances. PRA II will be USAID/Peru's signature program to demonstrate that MSMEs can improve their incomes by benefitting from such opportunities as the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.</p>

<DESC>MCSC CT021 J&A Number: 13,069.0
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALTO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Competition Advocate, hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described herein using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) which implements Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  
JUSTIFICATION
1.  Contracting Activity
Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM)Program Manger, Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (PM ONS) Contracts Group2200 Lester StreetQuantico, VA  22134-6050
2.  Nature/Description of Action
Approval is requested to use other than full and open competition to fill a requirement to procure 282 Green Beam Designators III (Custom) (GBD-IIIC) retrofitted with a Safety Control Module(SCM), known as the LA-9/P, due to "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The proposed action encompasses the negotiation and award of a Firm Fixed Price contract to B.E. Meyers & Co. Inc., 14540 NE 91st Street, Redmond, WA 98052. 
The total estimated dollar value of this requirement is $3,705,000
3.  Description of Supplies/Services
Under the proposed contract, the Marine Corps will procure 282 B. E. Meyers LA-9/Ps overpacked with Government approved Installation Instructions, LA-9/P Technical Manual (TM) 11352A-OI per system and 282 pelican cases.  The additional 2 LA-9/P are to replace combat losses that were sustained during FY09.
The LA-9/P will replace the currently fielded GBD-IIIC.  Using the GBD-IIIC alone has the potential to cause eye injury when used within the Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) of 62.9 meters established by the Navy Laser Safety Review Board (NLSRB) on 8 May 2009.  The LA-9/P is the result of integrating an eye-safe laser range finder with the GBD-IIIC to prevent inadvertent lasing within the NOHD.  The LA-9/P is a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) American National Standards Institute, Standard Z136.1 Class 3B laser that can mount to a weapon system or a pistol grip.  When armed and activated, the SCM beam precedes the GBD-IIIC green beam to determine if an object is within the NOHD.  The mechanical controls designed into the SCM will not allow the GBD-IIIC to fire if it detects a target within the NOHD.  Any object attempting to enter the green beam along the horizontal axis will first enter the SCM beam.  
The LA-9/P is designed to be an effective medium range non-lethal warning device to deter and dissuade non-combatants in current and future missions from encroaching unauthorized zones; thereby, expanding engagement options of Marines during Escalation of Force (EoF) procedures at Entry Control Points (ECPs), Vehicle Check Points (VCPs) and during convoy security operations.  
4.  Identification of Statutory Authority
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) which implements FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  
5.  Demonstration of the Contractor's Unique Qualification and Rationale for Use of the Authority Cited
B.E. Meyers is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the GBD-IIIC and attached SCM, which are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) items.  The Government does not have any intellectual property rights in or to the GBD-III and/or the SCM.  Moreover, the Government does not have a technical data package, which would permit the procurement of the GBD-III and/or the SCM through full and open competition.  Therefore, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(b)(2), which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the existence of limited rights in data make the supplies and services available from only one source.
Notwithstanding the fact that the existence of limited rights in data make the supplies and services in support of the GBD-III and the SCM, which comprise the LA-9/P laser system, available only from B. E. Meyers, supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).  
Any other source would have to develop the various proprietary components of the GBD-III and the SCM, which were designed by B.E. Meyers exclusively at its private expense.  The amount of time required for another source to develop the capability of the various proprietary componets of the GBD-III and the SCM is conservatively estimated at not less than nineteen (19) months.  
Furthermore, award to any other source would require a Laser Hazard Evaluation (LHE) and NLSRB approval prior to being fielded and employed.  The B. E. Meyers GBD-IIIC and SCM that make up the LA-9/P laser system is the only laser system that has been approved by the NLSRB Dahlgren Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center for Marine Corps deployment.  The amount of time required to perform the requisite testing, evaluation and certification is conservatively estimated at not less than six (6) months.  Therefore, the amount of time required for another source to develop the capability of the various proprietary componets of the GBD-III and the SCM, and perform the requisite testing, evaluation and certification is estimated at not less than twentyfive (25) months, and would result in unacceptable delays in satisfying these requirements in support of the warfighter's prosecution of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  
6.  Efforts Made to Solicit Potential Sources
A Pre-Award Synopsis was issued on NECO on 1 July 2009.  This announcement expressed the Marine Corps' intent to award a contract on a sole-source basis for the supplies identified herein.  Moreover, the synopsis invited any interested parties to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  No inquiries or responses were received in response to this synopsis.  
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost
The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The B. E. Meyers LA-9/P is a COTS item with established commercial pricing.  Price Analysis and historical pricing from previous buy of the GBD-IIICs and SCMs will be used in determining a fair and reasonable price.  Quantity discounts will be sought.  
8.  Description of Market Research
The synopsis discussed above in paragraph 6 served as a contemporaneous market survey by advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting capabilities from any interested parties.  No inquiries or responses were received. 
9.  Other Supporting Facts
As provided in paragraph 5, the GBD-IIIC and attached SCM are COTS items.  The Government does not have any intellectual property rights in or to the GBD-III and/or the SCM.  Moreover, the Government does not have a technical data package, which would permit the procurement of the GBD-III and/or the SCM through full and open competition. 
10.  Listing of Interested Sources
None; see paragraph 6 above. 	11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition
The PM ONS will conduct market research to seek other sources if additional requirements are received.  In addition, the Marine Corps has started the Ocular Interruption Program that will develop a system to replace the LA-9/P.  As this is an acquisition effort the new device is not scheduled for fielding until FY14.  
12.  Statement of Delivery Requirements
Delivery is to begin 120 days after contract award and will be completed within twelve months of the first delivery date. 
13.  Estimated Dollar Value of the Acquisition Covered by This J&A
Fiscal Year (FY) 08 PMC Global War on Terroism (GWOT) funding has been identified for the procurement of 244 B. E. Meyers LA-9/P systems and FY 09 PMC OOTW funding has been identified for the procurement of 38 B. E. Meyers LA-9/P systems.  The estimated schedule of funding for the B. E. Meyers LA-9/P program is as follows:
						Description	FY08	FY09	FY10	FY11	FY12	FY13Production	$3,204,000	$0	$0	$0	$0	$0Production	$0	$501,000	$0			$3,204,000	$501,000	$0	$0	$0	$0$3,705,000








14.  Acquisition Plan
A written Acquisition Plan is not required due to the fact that this procurement does not meet the threshold dollar amounts delineated in DFARS 207.103(d)(i). no acquisition is required   
15.  Documentation of Spare and Repair Parts Acquisition
The LA-9/P is a Stores Account Code (SAC) 3 consumable item.  Therefore,  spares will not be procured with this acquisition.  All other components are catalogued and in the Marine Corps Supply system.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Competition Advocate, hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described herein using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(g)(1)(b).  
LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
1.  Contracting Activity
Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM)Program Manger, Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (PM ONS) Contracts Group2200 Lester StreetQuantico, VA  22134-6050
2.  Nature/Description of Action
The use of other than full and open procedures for the issuance of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the procurement of B.E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green Lasers.  The proposed action requires limiting competition to sources on the basis of obtaining the Brand Name item. 
The total estimated dollar value of this requirement is $1,081,500.
3.  Description of Supplies/Services
Under the proposed contract, the Marine Corps will procure 228 GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green Lasers and one Technical Manual per system.  The B.E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green is a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) American National Standards Institute, Standard IEC Class 3B visible weapon mounted Laser system with a Nominal Ocular Hazard (NOHD) distance of 25.2 meters.  It is designed to be an effective short range non-lethal warning device to deter and dissuade non-combatants in current and future missions from encroaching unauthorized zones; thereby, expanding engagement options of Marines during Escalation of Force (EoF) procedures at Entry Control Points (ECPs), Vehicle Check Points (VCPs) and during convoy security operations. 
4.  Identification of Statutory Authority
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c(1), 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 


5.  Demonstration of the Contractor's Unique Qualification and Rationale for Use of the Authority Cited
The Army Rapid Equipping Force transferred 392 B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Greens to Marines supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in 2007.  The Program Manager, Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (PM ONS) procured five B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Greens to obtain safety approval from the Naval Laser Safety Review Board (NLSRB) and to conduct training.  The NLSRB approved use of the B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green as a mounted device on 1 February 2008.  
B. E. Meyers is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green and to date, is the only manufacturer with the necessary expertise to manufacture a Dazzling Laser that meets the short range capability gap identified in the Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS).  The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green has gone through successful testing by the NLSRB, training packages have been developed, and training has been conducted in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS).  CONUS training is continually conducted in three locations. 
No other manufacturer can develop, produce, and complete testing in time to meet schedule requirements or has the prerequisite technical knowledge, special tooling and familiarity to manufacture a comparable GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green without incurring additional costs to the United States Marine Corps (USMC).
6.  Efforts Made to Solicit Potential Sources
The PM ONS procured the five B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Greens in 2007 via a Request for Quote.  The following three sources submitted a quote:  ADS Inc., B. E. Meyers & Co. Inc., and Amron International.  ADS Inc. was the successful bidder that was determined to be the best value.  Recent market research revealed that the B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green is still available through the three sources referenced above, at a minimum.  Other similar products do not meet or cannot be modified to meet the Marine Corps' need in a timely manner.  The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green has completed safety testing and has been approved by the NLSRB for Marine Corps use.  Competing for other manufacturers would require development/modification of a Dazzling Laser that meets the requirements in the Statement of Need (SON), retesting and reevaluation by the NLSRB, and development of additional training materials and scenarios, which would negate any cost benefit derived from competition to solicit for another brand of mini green laser.
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost
In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer (CO) shall ensure that all supplies ordered under this contract are procured at a fair and reasonable price.  The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green is a COTS item with established commercial pricing.  The CO also has historical pricing from the three quotes referenced in paragraph 6 that will be used in determining a fair and reasonable price.  The CO will seek large quantity discounts when possible. 

8.  Description of Market Research
As stated in paragraph 6 above, efforts were previously made to solicit sources that manufacture similar items.  Results from the market research were that other than B. E. Meyers product, no other products on the     market could meet the Government's requirement.  Testing has confirmed that the B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green brand meets the requirements of the Government.  
9.  Other Supporting Facts
Marines require non-lethal EOF capabilities to safeguard the lives of innocent civilians while protecting the force.  The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green capability is essential to EOF tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) missions and tasks at Vehicle Check Points (VCP) and during convoy security operations.  Contract award to another source will result in unacceptable delays in fielding this critical capability.
10.  Listing of the Available Sources for the GLARE MOUT 532P-M
-	ADS Inc.-	B. E. Meyers & Co. Inc. -	Amron International	11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition
Currently, B. E. Meyers is the only manufacturer capable of meeting the Marine Corps' requirement for a short range Dazzling Laser.  The PM ONS will conduct market research to seek other sources if additional requirements are received in the future.  
12.  Statement of Delivery Requirements
Delivery is to begin 120 days after contract award and will be completed within twelve months of the first delivery date. 
13.  Estimated Dollar Value of the Acquisition Covered by This J&A
Funding	Description	FY08	FY09	FY10	FY11	FY12	FY13PMC Core	Production	$607,500	$421,000	$0	$0	$0	$0PMC SUPPL	Production		$53,000				Total	$607,500	$474,000	$0	$0	$0	$0Program Total	$1,081,500The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green is fully funded.  Fiscal Year (FY) 08 and 09 Core and FY09 Supplemental Procurement Marine Corps (PMC) funding in the amount of $1,081,500 is available to buy out the acquisition objective of 228 systems stated in the SON.  The estimated schedule of funding for the B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green program is as follows: 14.  Acquisition Plan
A Marine Corps Single Acquisition Management Plan (MC-SAMP) is being developed and will be staffed for final signature by the Director, Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS) upon completion.  However, based on the dollar value of the procurement no formal acquisition plan is required.   15.  Documentation of Spare and Repair Parts Acquisition
The B. E. Meyers GLARE-MOUT 532P-M Mini-Green is a Stores Account Code (SAC) 3 consumable item; therefore, no spares will be procured with this acquisition.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AUTHORITY CITED:Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures, including sole-source awards, for contracts awarded to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) where the anticipated price will not exceed 55,000,000 (including options). We considered limiting competition to VOSB but. Alliant Healthcare was the only VOSB we found that could meet the Government's requirements. Therefore, we have elected to use authority of PL 109-461. 38 USC 8127(c), to conduct the procurement on a sole-source basis, 5. DESCRIPTON OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE  SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICALBE.The procurement was for a Surgical Integration System consisting of numerous items and components which are made by Stryker Corp and sold by Alliant Healthcare Products, a VOSB company. The communication, endoscopy booms, surgical lights and tower integration is an all encompassing OR system that enables the surgical suite to communicate with other OR rooms pathology; ICU and other areas throughout the facility. Keeping with the priorities of FAR Part8, a check was done on GSA Advantage in an attempt to determine if this product, or like products, were available on Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). Although there were companies that have some components on FSS, Stryker is the only company offering a completely integrated system. Alliant does have an FSS schedule, but these items are not currently available on their FSS contract. Stryker and Alliant's past performance was checked and they were rated superior.6. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The procurement was reviewed against other contractors' products to determine price lair and reasonableness. Other comparable lights, monitors, booms, and arms were found and prices were determined to be comparable with the products being purchased. In a lot of instances. Stryker Equipment was priced lower than other FSS contract holders.7.	MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED:  Extensive market research was conducted per FAR Part 10,8.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL  AND OPEN COMPETITION: The requirement will be procured with an exception to Fair and Open Competition under FAR 6.302-5. based upon the authority of PL 109-461, 38 USC 8127(c).9, A LISTING OF THE SOURCES. IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING. AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:NIA10. STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY. THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION  FOR THE SUPPLIES REOUIRED: Alliant does have an FSS contract and plans to add these items to their contract in the future,. I l CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: "I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief",1.
