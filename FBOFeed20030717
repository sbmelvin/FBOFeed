TVA intends to enter into an agreement(s) with one or more qualified firm(s) to provide solutions for capture of SO3 including but not limited to, injection systems, catalysts, etc. at TVA’s Fossil Plants.  TVA desires to develop a system wide SO3 mitigation plan for application throughout the TVA system.  This applies especially on coal fired units burning or planning to burn eastern U.S. coal in the 1.2-6.0 lb sulfur/MM-Btu range.  TVA strongly prefers that the SO3 mitigation be accomplished after the flue gas exits the economizer (or SCR as appropriate) but before the gas enters the air heater.  TVA is soliciting expressions of interest, including innovative financial arrangements and project delivery arrangements for the project(s).

TVA desires to select firm(s) that have a history of successful experience with environmental systems as well as balance of plant systems.

TVA will have certain mandatory minimum qualifications that Respondents must meet before consideration.  Only those Respondents which certify to TVA that they can fully meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will be considered.  Prospective offerors will be required to submit detailed supporting documentation (with their proposals) to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements as stated below.  Teaming and subcontracting relationships are encouraged, and these minimum qualification requirements may collectively be satisfied by combining the qualifications of team members and subcontractors committed to perform in the event of award.  Individual qualification criteria, however, must be satisfied by individual entities.  The following is a summary of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements: A) Has successfully supplied, erected (for turnkey work), and placed into service or successfully demonstrated mitigation equipment for the pollutant described above.

E) Has a design presence in the TVA region or be willing to establish a presence in the region either directly, through teaming arrangements, or through sub-contractor alliances.  F) Has the financial capacity (creditworthiness) to guarantee the timely performance, obligations, duties and responsibilities under or related to the contract (including performance and warranty issues), for the term of the contract.  G) Has an established Total Quality Program.  H) Has the ability to provide information on equipment performance history, experience data of design and experience data of erection.  FOR TURNKEY/INSTALLATION WORK.  I) Must be willing to become signatory to TVA’s project labor agreement.

<DESC>The purpose of a MIS, or a network of MISs, is to educate the traders, producers and consumers about the market.  A better understanding of the market should lead to informed decision making, resulting in higher profits for producers and traders as well as lower prices for consumers.  In effect, the result would be increased trade based food security, achieved by providing commercially relevant and timely information to promote cross border trade.    Current market information enables farmers to negotiate with traders from a position of greater strength and encourages an efficient distribution of products between markets.  Increasing the capacity of traders’ organizations is seen as key in the development of a regional market information system that must respond to commercial needs, and not academic or bureaucratic exigencies.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate/Power Division (AFRL/PRP) solicits research proposals for Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space.  The Power Division (AFRL/PRP) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to develop, demonstrate and improve upon key power and thermal technologies supporting air and space applications in the areas of Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The technical improvements in these four areas will contribute toward meeting the Power Division's goals in the 2009 and beyond timeframe, and goals deemed necessary to facilitate nearer-term transition or transfer.   

Power and thermal technologies for aircraft support the integrated goals of the joint DoD/NASA/Industry More Electric Initiative.  Advanced power technologies support the initiative to develop directed energy weapons and place these weapons on airborne platforms.  The airborne use of directed energy weapons is driving the onboard electrical power requirements beyond the limits of conventional electrical power and thermal management systems and has driven the need to develop the necessary power generation, distribution and conditioning technologies required for the airborne use of these weapons.  Power technologies for space applications develop innovative technologies to reduce spacecraft size and weight, increase efficiency, increase operational life and develop affordable spacecraft.  

The over arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of a 7-year open-ended solicitation spanning the four major technology areas of Power Generation, Power Management and Distribution, Energy Storage and Subsystem Integration for Air and Space applications.  This strategy will provide AFRL/PRP an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs on a “real-time” basis as ever-changing technology issues are identified.  

The BAA will remain “open” for 7 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during "calls".  Each call will identify solicitation topics and will contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission.  

The first “call” for proposals occurs with the issuance of this BAA.  Refer to Part 5 of the solicitation for detailed information concerning the Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Scientific Research Program.  This program will sponsor scientific research and early development of materials, thermal concepts, battery cells and others, in the following four major research areas in which problems frequently arise which require unique and innovative solutions: Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The anticipated funding for this program is $49M.

Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement

<DESC>The National Oceanic and atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Silver Spring Md., intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with 
Extension Technology, Inc., of  Alpharetta, GA to manufacture the Photodidoe, CHI Receiver, Silicone Avalanche for the ASOS Celometer.

The receiver optics is designed to focus the incoming light onto a silicon avalanche photodiode. Because only the wavelength of the transmitted pulse (904 nanometers (nm)) is needed, a filter built into the receiver circuit blocks out the majority of the extraneous signals.  The photodiode converts the light signals into a small electrical current. The preamplifier in the receiver circuit converts this current into a larger voltage signal and is sampled by the A/D converter to produce a digital value. This digital value is then stored in the sample accumulator, processed and reported to the data collection package (DCP).

The Vendor=s product must meet the following specifications: For the specific Silicone Avalanche Photodiode P/N: C30817E on the VAISALA model CT12K Receiver Board that detects reflections of the transmitted laser pulses. The Government shall procure 100 Silicone Avalanche Photodiode P/N. Delivery expected 16 weeks after award date.  NWS performs repair of the VAISALA model CT12K at the NWS National Reconditioning  Center in Kansas City, MO.

Vendors who believe that they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating they can meet the Governments requirements.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement tot competition based upon response tot his notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative responses must be received no later than 5 calendar days after the posting of this notice.

Land Chair at the U.S. Naval War College, Newport, RI.  A market survey was conducted in May 2003.  One potential offeror responded to the 2003 sources sought synopsis, but was considered unqualified.  As no further interest in the procurement has been received since the in CBD/FedBiz Ops Notice of July 24, 2000, or FedBizOpps Notice of May 22, 2003, there is no reason to believe that market conditions have changed.  Therefore, the Maritime Administration intends to award a sole source contract to the incumbent Professor Robert K. Reilly for his services filling the Emory S. Land Chair for an additional 10 month period.

The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement for Navy Display Systems (NDS).  It consists of the AN/UYQ-70(V) Advanced Display Systems and the Future Common Display System (FCDS).  The government is interested in selecting one offeror to manufacture and support this equipment.  However, it is equally important to provide integration and manufacturing capability for the entire family of new and evolving systems such as the CVN 77 MultiModal Worksta tion, DD(X) Next Generation Workstations and systems for new platforms including Littoral Combat System (LCS), CVN 21 and LHA(R).  The requirement includes a Common Future Display focusing on Human Systems Integration facilitated by the use of an Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) which will service total ship combat and non-combat processing needs that can be utilized aboard any ship platform.  The Government intends to convene a “users” team to ensure all platforms and users of the various systems provide a coordinated integrated approach to the evolutionary nature of this contract.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, Cost-Type and Firm Fixed Price contract is expected to result from the request for proposal (RFP).  The contract is expected to include separately priced line items for first article units, production units, kits, spares, engineering servic es, training, and data.  The minimum quantity is expected to consist of first article units.  The contract is expected to contain five production years and include five additional award-term years.  It is anticipated that it will allow for an estimated ordering quantity of 500 NDS and kits per year.  First article unit delivery, testing, and qualification will be required within 16 months after receipt of order.  Production unit delivery will be required within 180 days after receipt of order.  Delivery will be FOB Origin to the location specified in the delivery order.  A draft RFP will be issued on or around 4th Qtr FY03 and will be available for download at http://www.eps.gov and http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Questions and comments on the draft RFP must be submitted to the NAVSEA PCO, Beverly Hobbs, at HobbsBL@navsea.navy.mil.  A formal RFP will be issued on or around 4th Qtr F Y03.

The grass growth will be maintained so that it is not higher than ten inches nor less than four  inches. The area to be mowed comprises approximately five and one-half acres of surface and is depicted on the attached drawing.   EPA estimates that, under the usual precipitation conditions for the area (45 inches/year), the grass will require mowing approximately eight to ten times per year  beginning in April and ending in October.  The grass maintenance will include "weed wacking" along the chain link fence bordering the south-western boundary of the area, along the southern embankment of the hiking/biking trail (the former railroad embankment) that forms the northern boundary of the  area, and around the catch basin inlet on the eastern side of the area.  In order to prevent "clumping" and matting of the grass and the production of  ruts by the mowing equipment, mowing shall not be done under wet conditions.  The contractor will make minor top soil replacements (up to two cubic  yards of topsoil per incident), as necessary to repair incidental damage and erosion, and will also re-seed (up to 10 pounds of seed per incident) any small areas requiring re-seeding.  Any damage done to the ground surface, such as rutting of the top soil, by the contractor, shall be repaired by  the contractor at his expense.  The contractor shall assure that any entry gate(s) that he unlocks upon his arrival is/are again locked upon his departure from the Site.  The contractor shall inform the EPA Remedial Project Manager (RPM) of any problems encountered, and of any ground surface  conditions, such as excessive erosion that require EPA's attention.  The contractor shall initially visit the Site with the RPM in order to view the area to be mowed prior to any actual mowing activity.  The RPM can be contacted at 215-814-3217.  This procurement is being conducted under the  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR 13.  Anticipated award date on or about August 8, 2003.  BASIS OF AWARD WILL BE ON PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE.  Only facsmile requests will be honored, reference RFQ number.

<DESC>B—The overall goal of this project is to develop a standard evaluation and intervention protocol that can be used to accommodate the special needs of noise-exposed, hearing-impaired workers so that they can continue to perform their jobs safely while preventing additional hearing loss.

There are currently no guidelines to assist these workers, their supervisors, or hearing conservation program managers in accommodating the unique difficulties associated with working in a noisy environment with impaired hearing. Request for Quotations must be in writing only. You may FAX your request to the following number: (513)533-8283, Attn: Cheryl A. Ball. All responsible businesses may submit a written quotation which, if received timely, will be considered by the government. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized for this purchase. The anticipated issuance date of this RFQ is July 23, 2003. This is a Simplified Acquisition with an estimated value of less than $1000,000.00.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source purchase order, using FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition procedures, with Oliver Borchert, Gaithersburg, MD.  The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR subsection 13.106-1(b).  This procurement is for an extended module of the original Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching/Lightwave Agile Switching Simulator (GLASS) tool.

The sole source determination is based on the Contractor’s unique expertise and detailed knowledge of the GLASS tool, optical network protocols including routing, wavelength assignment, restoration and protection, and experience and familiarity with the Scalable Simulation Framework (SSFnet).  It is anticipated that a fixed price purchase order will be awarded, with an option for maintenance.  No RFQ package is available.  Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  If no affirmative responses are received by August 4, 2003 at 9:00a.m. the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to Oliver Borchert.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities, 8415 Datapoint Drive, Ste 400, San Antonio, TX  78229 for the Outreach to Rural and Urban Communities (OTRUC) Project.  The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how partnerships with HBCUs, HSIs, and TCs can assist CMS in achieving its broader goals, and test a model for helping States reduce racial health disparities.  The OTRUC project is a CMS collaboration with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges (TCs) to develop targeted outreach projects that address the needs of rural and underserved communities.  The projects are developed through partnerships with State Medicaid agencies, local agencies, and other community organizations.  The Contractor shall work with HSIs, State/local agencies, and community organizations to develop a dual eligible, Medicaid, or SCHIP outreach project that targets a rural or underserved community. The HBCUs, HSIs, and TCs have an established presence in racial and ethnic communities.  They have access to their respective communities that other organizations do not.  These institutions have the cultural competence and sensitivity to develop materials and delivery processes that will make connections within their respective communities.  Other vendors are not able to develop the trust within the communities to be effective with their outreach activities.  Traditional outreach techniques have not worked in racial and ethnic communities.

<SUBJECT>U -- COMMUNITY-BASED DIABETES SELF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR USE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-771-3-923523
<RESPDATE>073103

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intend to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Network for Health Services and Health Disparities, 11107 Maiden Drive, Bowie, Maryland  20720.  The goal of this procurement is to develop an understanding of the effectiveness of community-based diabetes self-management education upon members of the African American community. According to the literature, such programs have been shown to be generally effective, but depend upon collaborative models of care.  The objectives of the contract are to: 1) determine the knowledge of participants about the disease process of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), 2) identify the knowledge of African Americans with DM about self management of the disease, 3) provide information about the disease process of DM, 4) Discuss the risk factors for developing DM, 5) Describe strategies for self management and preventing complications of DM, 6) determine access to care among African Americans with DM, 7) describe strategies for self management and preventing complications of DM, and 8) measure the impact of the project by developing a follow-up evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the intervention to determine their progress on the participant’s behavior associated with current attitudes and practices for addressing disease management. The HBCUs National Network for Health Services and Health Disparities Research will identify two appropriate urban and rural HBCUs and other entities as program participants to carry out a community based diabetes self management education program for use in the African American community.  Approximately 250 persons from each site will participate in the program.  The program should target African American adults (males and females) 45 years and older diagnosed with diabetes or at high risk of developing the disease.  The perspective of an HBCU contractor is needed, especially to insure that questions are asked with sensitivity to issues of race and culture, as well as to insure a sophisticated understanding of the differential effects of race, culture, and socio-demographic variables. During this critical time when diabetes in the African American community continued to increase, it is essential that HBCU health services researcher(s) take a lead role in investigating the continuing determinants of this disparity.  For example, HBCU investigators live and work in the community and know that the problem of health disparities is not new.  The ability to conduct baseline studies, long-term follow-up, risk factor identification, health education interventions; identification of socio-cultural factors affecting health, ethnic influences, and measurement of health outcomes, contribute to the uniqueness of HBCU researchers.  The academic intellect currently available within the faculty and accessibility to the target population is an ideal combination needed to assist CMS and other government agencies to achieve their objectives. The HBCU Network is a consortium of HBCU investigators with the capacity to conduct health services research and programs such as the one envisioned here. Making the award to the consortium affords the agency the maximum flexibility in terms of the appropriate number and location of sites. Making the award to a single entity also reduces the fixed costs associated with the program design phase of the project.  A major factor for the sole source justification is that this organization is addressing a health area that CMS is concerned about.  The National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Network for Health Services and Health Disparities (The Network) was established in 1996 through a collaboration between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Office of Research, Demonstration, and Information (ORDI) and HBCUs in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, DC.  This effort was one of CMS’s activities designed to implement the mandate of the President’s Executive Order 12876 (New Order is 13256 – 2/12/02).  The Network is a non-profit organization established for the purpose of promoting opportunities that increase the capacity of HBCUs to develop and conduct quality health services research and outreach activities that address the health needs of African Americans.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a modification to a delivery order with Hamilton Sundstrand, Windsor Locks, CT 06096, to implement a software change to five modules of the Electronic Propeller Control (EPC) on the NP2000 propeller system in an attempt to minimize the likelihood of a decouple event.  Decouple is a gearbox safety feature employed to limit the amount of negative torque and prevent excessive drag on the E-2C aircraft, however it imposes a higher degree of difficulty in maintaining aircraft control.  The EPC software will implement a decrease pitch rate limit for a short interval following the Negative Torque System  (NTS) plunger action and an increase in the NTS gain.  The software logic changes will be verified and validated through engine/propeller dynamic software models and closed loop bench simulations.  Hamilton Sundstrand is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the 54460 and NP2000 propellers and is, therefore, the only source that possesses the resources and in-depth technical knowledge and technical data necessary to provide these services within the time required to meet USN requirements.  See Note 22.  NAVAIR synopsis No. 20064-03.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

UPDATE (15 JUL 03): The site visit has been rescheduled from 17 Jul 03 (1:30)  to 18 Jul 03 (9:00). Project Number 981911A: Renovate for DPC, Facility 30002 (Base) Project Number 981911C: Provide Furniture for DPC Fac. 30002 (Option I) Project Number 981911D: Relocate/Utilize Existing Furniture for DPM, DPF,                            MSS Fac. 30002 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0047 The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the three-phase renovation, purchase and  installation of new furniture in the DPC area, and relocate an utilize the  existing DPM, DPF, and MSS furniture in Facility 30002. The scope will also  include the architectural, electrical, environmental, fire protection,  mechanical, and plumbing modification and reconfiguration of Bays 1, 2, 3, and  4 in Facility 30002 to meet the functional requirements of multiple service  organizations. The overall estimated price range is between $5M and $10M.  The  Base Line Item is estimated between $1M and $5M, and the two Option Line Items  are estimated between $1M and $5M (combined).  The NAICS Code is 236220.  The  size standard is $28.5M.  This is a RESTRICTED procurement for 8(a) Small  Business Concerns certified in Region 5, Kentucky, West Virginia, and  Pennsylvania.  This is in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness  Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: Facility 30002 is being  renovated to house the main administrative offices and  customer service areas for the personnel management  organizations servicing both the military and civilian  population of WPAFB.  The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations.

(2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation.

<DESC>The due date for receipt of Phase I responses is hereby changed to 2 JUNE 2003.  The following provides a description of the project requirements:  The National Museum of the Marine Corps building is a new building to be located on an undeveloped site located at the junction of I-95, VA 619 & US 1 in Prince William County Virginia on Federally owned property.  The building’s function is to house museum space to display the heritage of the US Marine Corps.  In addition to the 60,000 square feet of museum gallery space there will be an orientation theater, some general-purpose offices, a gift shop, an entry lobby and mechanical space.  The 60,000 square feet of gallery space will consist of 42,000 square feet of high bay space, 25 – 35 foot high, and a central gallery of 18,000 square feet enclosed by a monumental skylight.  The building is approximately 87,700 GSF on two levels.  Level one is 80,000 GSF and level two is 7,700 GSF.  There are options to add 7,500 GSF of additional exhibit space to level one and 8,500 GSF to level two for a total of 16,000 GSF of additional space.  The additional second level space will house additional offices, a multi-purpose room and a cafeteria with a full service kitchen.  The structural system is a combination of cast-in-place concrete walls and columns and steel columns and beams all supported by spread footings.  The roof and floor decks are primarily concrete fill on metal deck.  There will be earth berms around the perimeter of the building that will require significant earth work within the general footprint of the building.  The exterior cladding of the building is primarily cast-in-place architectural concrete, CMU and metal panels.  There is a limited amount of storefront windows and entrances.  All glazing will be laminated glass.  Unique Features:  the entire 18,000 square foot central gallery will have an asymmetrical cone shaped monumental skylight over it.  The skylight starts at a point 45 feet above the finish floor and extends to a point 150 feet above the finish floor.  A central stainless steel clad support mast for the skylight will extend from the finish floor elevation of the central gallery through the top of the skylight to a height of 205 feet.  The mast structure is a steel box frame.  The central gallery is a 150 foot diameter circular space with 45 feet high walls which are clad in travertine stone. The floor is epoxy terrazzo.  The work will require coordination with a work of a separate contract for the exhibitory in the gallery spaces.  It is anticipated that portions of this work will be done at the same time as the museum is being completed. There will be a series of milestone dates for turning over portions of the exhibit space for exhibit fabrication and installation that will occur prior to the completion of the museum.

This modification is to answer questions, received for solicitation Number USS0300031 and to amend line item 0006.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) is currently seeking sources for the assembly and manufacture of the BLU-97B/B submunition (Part Number 809420-70 and in accordance with Navy Munitions Data #NMD-189B Rev. G dated 29 Apr 2003) in order to determine if adequate systems engineering, manufacturing, assembly and test capability exists to support a competitive reprocurement in support of the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW-A) production program.  The effort would involve manufacture, assembly and testing of the BLU-97B/B bomblet in accordance with a Government provided Technical Data Package (TDP) using Government Furnished Material (GFM) in “as-is” condition in inventory at the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant and new manufactured parts.  The planned effort would also involve assumption of systems engineering responsibility for the BLU-97 design.  NAVAIR anticipates award of a competitive production contract for BLU-97B/B submunitions beginning in FY05 or FY06, including a base year and four years of fixed priced production options.  Production of BLU-97B/B submunitions is expected to continue through FY17 at a rate of 65,000 bomblets per year (not including potential FMS sales) or until the inventory objective is achieved.   The majority of the current BLU-97B/B components in GFM stores are only available through FY07.  The GFM inventory will be made available for inspection by potential offerors prior to submission of a proposal.  Additionally, as part of the competitive reprocurement, potential offerors must have the capability to redesign the BLU-97B/B submunition to eliminate hazardous unexploded ordnance (through self-neutralization or other means) and produce test articles to validate an engineering change proposal (ECP) to the Technical Data Package for insertion in future production should funding for the engineering change become available to the program.  Other key goals of the redesign effort will be to maximize use of existing GFM parts, ensure no degradation of existing BLU-97B/B performance, comply with MIL-STD-2105 and potentially MIL-STD-1316E (if significant changes to the fuzing are planned), and reduce life cycle cost for the BLU-97B/B submunition.    Interested parties are requested to reply by 31 August 2003 to Ms. Lori Frame, by email at FrameLA@navair.navy.mil and to arrange for a technical briefing that includes your company’s capability to produce the existing BLU-97B/B submunition design per the Technical Data Package as a prime contractor and capability to design a solution to eliminate hazardous unexploded ordnance.

<SUBJECT>B --Workshop:  Extended 1553B Databus Performance Workshop
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center Aging Aircraft Division, ASC/AAA, WPAFB, OH, will host an Extended 1553B Databus Performance Workshop, 0830-1600, Tuesday,  23 September 2003.  The scheduled workshop will be held at the Hope Hotel and  Conference Center (http://www.hopehotel.com/frame.htm), Super-Flying/Main  Ballroom, Area A, WPAFB, OH.  Please consider this notice as preliminary  notification.  Expanded workshop details and registration provisions will be  made available in approximately 10 working days.  Extended (high-bandwidth) 1553B data bus performance will be demonstrated and  the business plan for deploying the enabling Xi Channel technology will be  discussed by Edgewater Computer Systems, Inc., http://www.edgewater.ca/.  One- on-one technical interchange, held in conjunction with the subject workshop,  with Edgewater Computer Systems can be requested by contacting the company  through their website.  Substantive discussion with Edgewater requires formal  concurrence with their Proprietary Information Agreement (PIA), demanding  responsive action to ensure adequate cycle time for PIA review and coordination  (approx. 30 days.)   All conference registrants, other than US government employees and/or military  personnel will be required to submit a certified copy of their DD 2345.   Military personnel and civilian government employees of the United States  Government are exempt from the DD 2345 certification requirements.  The subject  workshop is ITAR restricted in accordance with DOD Directive 5230.5, under the  provisions of Public Law 98-94, “Department of Defense Authorization Act,  1984”, Section 1217, September 24, 1983.  Only certified individuals under  directive 5230.5 are eligible to obtain access to unclassified technical data  with military or space applications in the possession of or under the control  of the Department of Defense. To determine if your employer already has a certification on file that extends  to all employees, contact the Joint Certification Office at (616) 961-4485 or  (800) 352-3572.  If your employer or you are not certified, certification may  be requested by completing the DD Form 2345 (OCT 2001) and must be submitted to  the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Services Center,  Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084.  Processing time is approximately  one month.  The Joint Certification Office will notify each company’s security  officer by mail if the company’s request for certification as been approved.   Questions regarding the application approval process should be directed to the  Joint Certification Office.   The planned event will 1) showcase Air Force investment activity aimed at  enhancing 1553B throughput performance, 2) highlight the results from two  independent 1553B assessments, 3) provide a forum to discuss anticipated  databus bandwidth requirements and options for meeting expanded throughput  across existing 1553B cable plants and 4) introduce Air Force business and  technical strategies for assessing and validating expanded (high-bandwidth)  1553B performance across existing cable as flight capable.   Under an Air Force Dual Use Science and Technology (DUST) Program award,  ASC/AAA has teamed with ASC/ENA, AFRL/IFTA and HECV and the Ogden Air Logistics  Center F-16 System Program Office to accelerate demonstrating high bandwidth  1553B performance capabilities, using existing 1553B cable plants.  The shift  to netcentric warfare, achieved through information dominance, demands the  existing force structure has the required avionics databus bandwidth headroom  to affordably accommodate quick reaction capability growth.  Avionics  advancements continue to enable leading edge platforms to be readily equipped  with combat superior capabilities; however, incurred bandwidth constraints can  no longer be affordably mitigated through additional cable plant insertions.   Alternative transmission options for legacy aircraft are not attractive to the  Air Force because of the incurred wiring modification and/or  test/recertification burden.    The Air Force Expanded 1553B Databus Performance team encourages broad industry  representation and is looking forward to vigorous interchange and discussion.   Lead avionics engineers from the major ASC system program offices will be in  attendance.  Invitations will be extended to relevant avionics representatives  from the other services. Again, expanded workshop details will be made available in approximately 10  working days.

This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated as a result of this announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to request “white papers” for a Marine Airborne Command and Control Communications Capability (MAC4).

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, but anticipates making an award within the approximately $1,000,000.00 expected to be budgeted for the MAC4.  This BAA shall remain open for receipt of white paper proposals through 16 September 2003.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this BAA is 541710 with the small business size of 1,500 employees.  No portion of this BAA has been set-aside for historically black colleges and universities or minority institute participants, though their participation is encouraged.  For awards made as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits of the proposal shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions. If the contracting officer requests a full cost proposal, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Woman Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. 

White papers will be evaluated in the order in which they are received and may be accepted at any time prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals/white papers.  White papers/proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  Proposals identified as feasible for potential funding may result in a contract; however, there is no commitment made by the Marine Corps, expressed or implied, to make any awards, to make a specific number of awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by the Offeror before award of any contract.  Information provided herein is subject to amendment and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract.
 
II.  BACKGROUND:

The current airborne command and control package (AN/ASC-26) used to transmit and receive tactical radio communications is technologically dated and fails to provide the functions required by the Marines.  The AN/ASC-26 provides three (3) legacy single-channel radios: one (1) AN/ARC-159 Ultra High Frequency (UHF) (225.00-399.975 Megahertz (MHz)) and two (2) AN/ARC-186 Very High Frequency (VHF) Amplitude Modulation / Frequency Modulation (AM/FM) (30-87.975, 108-115.975 receive only, and 116-151.975 MHz).  The MAC4 is intended to offer an updated system that meets the current needs of the MAGTF Commander, specifically a frequency hopping capability.  The MAC4 should provide the latest command and control communications technology in a lightweight and portable package that may be mounted aboard several airborne platforms.

Several multi-band radios are currently available to meet this need and provide an additional capability of digital data connectivity.  These radios include the AN/ARC-210(V), AN/ARC-231, AN/PSC-5D and AN/PRC-117F.  

The MAC4 will consist of multiple VHF/UHF/Line of Sight (LOS) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) radios and a single Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS) radio.  Multiple processors will provide software support for Command and Control Personal Computers (C2PC), FalconView, Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) and Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) applications.  Multiple displays will allow the mission commander and crewmembers to view software output.  Operators may control the radios and software applications via keyboards and manual controls as necessary.  The MAC4 system must also include four (4) intercom stations.  The MAC4 may incorporate a modular design to facilitate the size and weight restrictions of smaller platforms if necessary.

III.  SCOPE - RESEARCH TOPIC INTEREST:

The design and development of the MAC4 system shall be based on the following requirements:

The MAC4 must mount to the UH-1N (with provisions for the UH-1Y), CH-46E, CH-53D/E, MV-22, and KC-130 platforms.  Initial concept modeling and development will begin with the UH-1N platform.
The MAC4 must provide standalone communications functions requiring only an external power supply and connection to external antennas.  The unit must use 28 volts Direct Current (DC) power and connect to the UH-1N at the hoist power outlet.
The MAC4 must specify all required antennas. 

The MAC4 shall weigh no more than 200 pounds and the unit must allow for installation and removal by not more than two operators.
The MAC4 shall successfully complete shock and vibration testing in accordance with Military Specification-810 (MIL-SPEC-810) and suitable for the UH-1N platform, including the 20gram (g)/20g/10g crashworthiness specifications.

The MAC4 shall be designed to withstand and remain operable in battlefield conditions, including resistance to inclement weather conditions and sand in accordance with MIL-SPEC-810. The MAC4 shall permit rapid ingress and egress from the helicopter platform.

The MAC4 will provide the ability for two (2) operator workstations. A modular design allowing for multiple operator workstations is desirable.  Each operator shall be provided a dedicated display and keyboard.  One workstation will be designated as the “primary” operator and provided access to the radio controls.  A scalable design allowing for different configurations on different vehicle platforms is desirable.
The MAC4 should allow for two primary operators and at least one secondary operator to have unobstructed visual access to a display.

The MAC4 will be in a configuration that permits four (4) mission essential personnel in the cabin area access to information provided by the workstation(s). The MAC4 must transmit and receive over VHF, UHF and SATCOM radio frequencies (30.00-512MHz).  The MAC4 must 1) operate in VHF/UHF single-channel, VHF Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS), UHF HAVEQUICK, EPLRS and DAMA/Dedicated SATCOM modes, 2) be capable of TYPE I encryption, and 3) be compatible with existing tactical communications platforms.

SATCOM is defined as the relative term of transference of data via ground based links (Earth Stations) and Satellites that are in orbital positions around the Earth.

Intercom requirements for the MAC4 shall provide communications capability for the operators, separate from the aircraft’s Intercom System (ICS), but will have a connection into the aircraft’s ICS to facilitate communication with the pilot and co-pilot.  EPLRS is a Time Division Multiple Access System (TDMAS) using a frequency hopping, spread spectrum waveform in the UHF band.  It incorporates internal Communications Security (COMSEC) devices of the Thorton family and has an Over-The-Air-Rekeying (OTAR) capability.

The MAC4 will be capable of operating and displaying information provided by the following software: (1) C2PC, (2) FalconView, (3) Navy Portable Flight Planning System (N-PFPS), and (4) GCCS-M.  C2PC is a Windows-based program that facilitates military command and control.  N-PFPS is a mission-planning program that has provisions for limited mission execution tracking.  N-PFPS may accept data from an EPLRS radio and display the information within FalconView.  GCCS-M is a UNIX based platform, supported by the SUN server.  GCCS-M is a command and control system supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and Commanders in Chief (CINCs) in managing military assets.  

An Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11b air-to-ground data communications capability is desired.  

A copy of the Universal Needs Statement (UNS) Improved Airborne Command and Control Capability - 00322FD that supports this desired capability is enclosed in this document.

The UH-1N will be provided for the Limited Technical Assessment (LTA) and for the demonstration.

The MAC4 is required to be fully operational by July 2004.

IV.  PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS:

MCWL will review all white papers that address the desired capabilities stated in the above scope.  White papers that do not address the identified technology areas will not be reviewed.  White Papers shall be no more than twenty (20) pages for the technical section and five (5) pages for the management section, prepared in 12-point or larger font, double-spaced, single-sided on 8.5 by 11 inches white paper.  The White Paper should summarize the proposed effort(s) and a rough order of cost magnitude (ROM) in order to obtain a preliminary indication of MCWL interest/feasibility.  It may be desired, but not required, for the contractor to present a technical briefing on the White Paper at Quantico, Virginia.  Technical briefings will only be requested after submission and review of White Papers that address the desired capabilities.  Offerors should not expect to present details subsequent to submission of their White Paper and should pr

(2) The second phase of the evaluation will be comprised of three areas: Technical, Past Performance, and Price. The Technical Area Criteria are:  Development/Implementation of Curriculum and Demonstration of Types of Training. Technical is more important than Past Performance.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are more important than price. Offerors must note the evaluation of  development/implementation of curriculum and demonstration of types of training will be essentially a subjective assessment by the technical evaluators. 

Technical Evaluation:

b)   Examples of such training are discussed and demonstrated in enough detail in the proposals to indicate success.  

c)  The information provided demonstrates unequivocally the Offeror's strengths and ability to conduct training in the area of technical surveillance.

(4) The Past Performance evaluation includes the Offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the Offeror's record of compliance with safety, environmental and security laws and regulations; and generally, the Offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers. 

(5)   Although price is less important than the other evaluation factors, it is an important factor.  Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the requirements and risks inherent in the scope of work. In addition, Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the offer within the total price proposed by the offeror.

 Cost will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and a total evaluated price for the entire length of contract.  When evaluating cost, the Government will determine if: 

·	the proposed cost reasonable for work to be performed;
·	reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; and
·	is consistent with approaches contained in the Offeror's management/technical proposal


(6) Award will be made to the offeror or offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the factors set forth in this solicitation.
