<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>A Deltavision OMX super-resolution microscope in the NHLBI DIR is in need of a one year Service Maintenance Agreement (SMA).

<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The Light Microscopy Facility in the NHLBI DIR is looking for a Service Maintenance Agreement (SMA) to cover a Deltavsion OMX super-resolution microscope (serial # OM06044, NIH decal # 01910518) for a one year agreement. The SMA should cover onsite and/or offsite repair, labor, parts, and travel costs associated with keeping this microscope properly working. The company that provides this service must have the knowledge and the capability to keep these microscopes in good working order.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>Maintenance agreement period of performance: 2/11/2014 - 2/10/2015</p>

<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the Sole/Single Source Justification that is attached to this Notice of Intent.</p>
<p>Only GE Healthcare (which owns Deltavision) has the proprietary knowledge to fix and maintain this microscope. No other company can provide this service. This is a very complicated microscope that enables very high resolution experiments. Only Deltavision as a subsidiary of GE Healthcare can service this microscope and maintain its functionality. This SMA must be purchased through GE Healthcare as a sole source order.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued for planning purposes, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. This notice is open to all sources.
<p>Background and Mission: <br />The mission of DTRA-Research and Development Enterprise (RD)-Chemical and Biological Directorate Technologies Directorate (CB) (DTRA-RD-CB), is to develop scientific knowledge, technical solutions and deliver Medical Counter Measures to reduce the chemical and biological threat to the military and the Nation. As part of this mission DTRA CB/JSTO seeks to initiate programs and deliver "Medical Counter Measures" (MCMs) against tier 1 infectious threat pathogens. Tier 1 list includes bacterial threat pathogens (natural or engineered) for which effective MCMs are required for preparedness.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The objective of this RFI is to identify candidate Small organic Molecules Inhibitors (SMI) that have the potential to potently and specifically inhibit multiple drug resistance (MDR) bacterial pathogens including tier-1 CDC/DoD listed bacterial.</p>
<p>The DoD is interested in exploring availability of SMIs that possess new mechanism of action(s) and are bactericidal against broad MDR bacterial infectious pathogens. DoD welcomes engagement of all sources that have reached at an advanced Phase I clinical studies or completed this clinical Phase.</p>
<p>Interested parties should fully describe their technology and provide all available information with respect to criteria listed below. Responders can be from the commercial sector, academia, the United States Government, and international entities.</p>
<p>General Guidelines: The SMIs of interest need to have supporting information for a unique, novel mechanism of action that does not substantially overlap with marketed anti-bacterial pathogens for which multiple drug resistance (MDR) strains have been identified. The compound of interest should have commenced Phase I clinical studies for safety, tolerability, and PK, and advanced through Single Ascending Dosing (SAD) regimens with promising data that support utility against civilian infectious diseases (including MDR pathogens below. Data supporting safety and tolerability of compound administered via systemic or oral routes for at least 10 consecutive days are of special interest to the DoD. In this latter respect, it is an advantage for the compound to be delivered as a single dose or twice a day dosing regimen in either the oral or systemic (intravenous) injections. <br />It is also assumed that the compound(s) of interest have completed 3 month Toxicokinetic studies in 2 species for the duration of 1-3 months with acceptable profile supporting the IND filing. Furthermore, it is expected that no major issues regarding CMC, acceptable shelf life, and formulation needed to support viable civilian indication have been identified.</p>
<p>Specific requirements:<br />A. DTRA CB/JSTO will screen against threat bacterial pathogens will seek in vitro screen of the company compound to establish MIC50/90 sets of the strains of interest. <br />B. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek small animal proof of concept (POC) studies using animal models where &lsquo;natural disease' profile acceptable to the FDA has been established. Where needed, complementary PK studies and modeling will be performed. <br />C. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek single efficacy study for treatment efficacy as per FDA guidance.<br />D. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek "animal rule" studies as guided by the FDA for respective threat pathogens.<br />E. DTRA CB/JSTO will require company to submit data generated in "animal rule" studies as sIND and eventually sNDA along with NDA submission for civilian indications.<br />F. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek the establishing of joint teams working in collaboration towards accelerated development path in tandem with all regulatory requirements. <br />G. It is also expected that the company intention in regards to compound development such as CAP (Community Attracted Pneumonia), UTI (Urinary Tract Infection), skin abscess etc.</p>

All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the responsibility of the new utility system(s) owner.<br /><br />Installation Description<br /><br />Keesler AFB is located in Biloxi, Mississippi. The installation is on a narrow peninsula running west to east, with the Back Bay of Biloxi to the north and the Gulf of Mexico, to the south. US Highway 90 parallels the base's southern border and provides access, by US Highways 49 and 110, to Interstate 10.</p>
<p>Biloxi is the second largest city in Harrison County and the third largest in Mississippi. The city's estimated year 2012 population is 44,578. Harrison County's estimated year 2012 population is 194,029. One-third of Biloxi's labor force is military personnel. Almost one-fourth of Biloxi's civilian, nonfarm employment is in government, and much of that is attributed to Keesler AFB. Keesler AFB and Ingalls Shipbuilding are the largest employers in the Jackson-Harrison County area. Keesler AFB contributes significantly to the regional economy through its direct employment and purchases from local businesses.</p>
<p>Keesler AFB covers 1,960 acres and has 18 acres of easements for runway clearance and 45 acres for gas lines right-of-access. Keesler AFB has 1,833 family housing units and 322 non-housing buildings. Average assigned personnel at Keesler AFB total about 30,700: 12,600 military personnel, 3,600 civilians, and 14,500 dependents. In addition, 31,000 military retirees and 47,000 retiree family members reside near Keesler AFB and have access to its facilities.</p>
<p>Keesler AFB is the home of one of the largest technical training centers and the second largest medical training center in the Air Force. The 81st Training Wing is the host unit. Major associate units are Headquarters Second Air Force and the 403d Airlift Wing.</p>
<p>The 81st Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) maintains and repairs all facilities, grounds, and infrastructure. It provides utilities, environmental protection, fire protection, and disaster preparedness. The CES also provides engineering support for new construction and renovations.</p>
<p>Additional information is available at: http://www.keesler.af.mil.</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>If sufficient interest is identified and this requirement proceeds in a competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br /><br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br /><br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br /><br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br /><br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br /><br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), Dahlgren, VA is seeking sources on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Integrated Warfare Systems Electronic Warfare (PEO IWS-2E) Office and the program under its cognizance. The intent of this market research is to determine the level of interest among qualified potential sources in providing capability advancements to the Surface Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) programmed upgrades described under the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), specifically in stages labeled Block 1, 2, 3 and 4. As these Block upgrades are implemented, trouble reports and needed improvements arise in part because of the integration of legacy systems to new technology (hardware and/or software) and in part because of improved threats. Projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Surface Navy EW capabilities via the application of state-of-the-art technologies are desired to protect against new and emerging threats to the Navy.</p>
<p>Specifically, NSWCDD is seeking Rapid Capability Insertion Program (RCIP) opportunities of relevance to the Naval Sea Systems Command, Integrated Warfare Systems Electronic Warfare (PEO IWS-2E) Office. It is expected that the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for proposed efforts will be at or near TRL-6, as defined in the Department of Defense Technology Readiness Assessment Guidance, dated April 2011. Relevant information demonstrating TRL-6 maturity should be included in response. Further demonstration, validation, and test &amp; evaluation events should be addressed in the response necessary to support TRL-7 within 12-18 months from the completion of the proposed effort; including detailed plans, schedule and costs for the complete task.</p>
<p>The RFI solicits responses for any or all topics of interest. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI.</p>

Provide improved or new shipboard-based decoy capabilities that provide increased protection from legacy or developing Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM) or provide increased endurance, easier recovery and reuse, etc., within the constraints of existing launch systems.<br />4. Provide improvements in Electronic Support (ES) capabilities to detect and classify advanced threats.<br />5. Provide improvements in Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities to counter advanced threats.<br />6. Expand the capabilities beyond the operating frequency bands of current EW systems.<br />7. Integrate situational-awareness information from EW as well as other sensor systems into a common display for EW operators.<br />8. Capabilities that reduce electro-magnetic interference (EMI) or otherwise improve the interoperability of shipboard EW systems.<br />9. Improve, integrate and/or simplify embedded training capabilities for EW.</p>

  With  No Sensitive Data but Requires Training

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE:

a. Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

b. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

c. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 

d. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING:

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days' notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

TRAINING:

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior Training.

(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Rules of Behavior. 

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete. 

The Certification and Accreditation (C&A) requirements do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required for this SOW.

<DESC>The USDA ARS Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit (CICG) in Ames, IA, intends to award procurement of an Organic Corn Winter Nursery to the University of Puerto Rico AES Research Office in San Juan, PR. This nursery will be managed by the USDA Organic Standards for producing corn. This nursery procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on previous organic corn winter nursery experiments that have utilized this farm space. Establishing a nursery in a different location may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiments and impair comparison of results from previous experiments. Introduction of corn experiments in a new location may negatively impact results from numerous years of research and could be detrimental to ongoing research. This vendor has proven their ability to provide farm space, ability to operate within the necessary parameters of our research, provide the stock, pollinating and harvesting supplies needed and to provide the local temporary help to assist breeders during the 4 week pollination period. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $52,068.50. This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the nursery space, supplies and labor required for this project. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 12:00 pm central time, February 19, 2014.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following: <br>  <br>   Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and  <br>   Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.   <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army. <br>  <br> Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly. <br>  <br> 3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br> The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br> Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br> This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br> 4. TARGET AUDIENCE: <br>  <br> All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI. <br>  <br> 5. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br>  <br> In an effort to gather information in a manner which can be analyzed, the US Army is requesting responses in three separate Sections (1) General Information; (2) Capability Questionnaire; and (3) General Feedback and Comments regarding the proposed concept and software products indicated (optional). <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 1: General Information <br>  <br> In order for a company's responses to Section 2 and Section 3 to be considered for the Government's analysis, the completion of Section 1, General Information, must be provided. <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 2: Questionnaire <br>  <br> The government is seeking comments from industry regarding the overall concept of the proposed ITES 3S contract.

<DESC>Sole Source Justification<br />Puerto Rico Army National Guard programed the hiring of two state positions of Environmental Techicians to their Environmental Staff station at San Juan PRANG Headquarters, the process has being slowed due to issues like developing the positions, PR elections hiring moratorium and more recently new government reorganization.&nbsp; <br />PRANG requested from EL Yunque National Forest, base on an active cooperation agreement between both agency, that we contract two environmental tech to give them support to their environmental compliance field program.<br />Ms Veronica Francis Rodriguez and Ms Rosa I Santos Alicea&nbsp;were&nbsp;contracted to that matter and they have&nbsp;being performing since February 2013.&nbsp; PRANG still is not prepared to recruit their permanent positions and has ask for us to extend the contract services for another year to give them time to advertise, recruit and fill their field technicians.&nbsp; They prefer the actual contractors to avoid issues like learning curve, security clearances, field knowledge of the training camps and associated military personnel and knowledge&nbsp;of Forest Service and PRANG rules and regulations.<br />Because of the sensitive and critical nature of the needed services and the fact that the proposed contractors have current skill,&nbsp;unique insight into the needs of the particular unit and possesses the expertise to accomplish these identified tasks, it is determined not feasible to obtain competition from another source at this time.<br />The facts and circumstances of this requirement dictate that, under the present circumstances, it is reasonable to solicit only one source, and in&nbsp;the best interests of the Government to recruit the services of Ms Veronica Rodriguez and Ms&nbsp;Rosa Santos Alicea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

Box 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194 for the procurement of a yearly maintenance renewal agreement for 577 statistical software licenses for CDC personnel to conduct statistical analysis on public health data.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).

SUDAAN offers procedures for descriptive statistics and for statistical modeling. The modeling procedures include both linear and multinomial-logistic models and a procedure for fitting proportional hazards (Cox) regression models for time-to-event data. Due to the sensitive nature of the statistical software, RTI is the only source that provides statistical software license support based on the data collection and studies of a senstive nature which ensures integrity in meeting the critical needs of the CDC mission. No other vendor is authorized to sell this software license due to its proprietary nature. RTI International has been the sole provider authorized to sell SUDAAN Statistical Software products.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541512 and the small business size standard is $25.5 million dollars. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.</p>

Reference #2014-57885.</p>
<p><br />Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services and/or supplies in the future.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, the Government shall consider all responses received within seven (7) days of this posting, in accordance with FAR 5.203 (A)(1). If no affirmative responses are received within seven (7) days, negotiations will be conducted with the RTI International, SUDAAN Statistical Software Center as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CLAUSES:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.

<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs.

<p>(11) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed.

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.

This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(15) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>

Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction? <br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)? <br />Management of Key Personnel <br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION:  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance.  <br>    <br>  2. PURPOSE:  <br>    <br>  The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following:  <br>    <br>    Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and <br>    <br>    Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.    <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army.  <br>    <br>  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly.  <br>    <br>  3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  <br>    <br>  The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br>   <br>  The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br>   <br>  Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br>   <br>  This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br>   <br>  4. TARGET AUDIENCE:  <br>    <br>  All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  5. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:  <br>    <br>  In an effort to gather information in a manner which can be analyzed, the US Army is requesting responses in three separate Sections (1) General Information; (2) Capability Questionnaire; and (3) General Feedback and Comments regarding the proposed concept and software products indicated (optional).  <br>    <br>  Instructions for Section 1: General Information  <br>    <br>  In order for a company's responses to Section 2 and Section 3 to be considered for the Government's analysis, the completion of Section 1, General Information, must be provided.  <br>    <br>  Instructions for Section 2: Questionnaire  <br>    <br>  The government is seeking comments from industry regarding the overall concept of the proposed ITES 3S contract.

<DESC>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS - 3 SERVICES (ITES-3S) <br> Request for Information <br>  <br> 1. DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command, in conjunction with Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 7 Feb 13 to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. Based on results of information received the Government is considering several changes to the acquisition strategy for ITES-3S.  <br>  <br> The period of performance has been changed from a total performance of 5 years to a total performance of 9 years.  In order to incentivize performance the additional years are added to reflect the use of Award Term for additional option periods for the top performing prime contractors.   <br>  <br> The estimated value of services within the scope of this effort has changed from $11B - $15B to $20B - $25B.   <br>  <br> The NAICS code has been changed from 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers to 541519, Other Computer Related Services.  <br>  <br> There are several task areas listed below that were within scope of ITES-2S and could be utilized to create very specific task orders.  These types of task orders created the potential of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues under ITES-2S.  Under ITES-3S these task areas will be considered incidental to the actual service being performed and will not be utilized to create individual task orders.   <br>  <br> Program/Project Management <br> Strategic Enterprise IT Policy and Planning <br> Change Management <br> Program Assessments and Studies <br> IT Research and Development <br> IT Strategic Planning Program Assessment and Studies <br> IT Project Cost & Schedule Management <br> IT Strategic Planning   <br> Management/Administrative Support/Data Entry  <br> Independent Verification and Validation. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The intent of this RFI is to: <br> 1)	Survey the marketplace to understand the number of businesses (large and small) that can accomplish these services as both prime or sub contractors, <br> 2)	Obtain industry suggestions for a more effective pricing methodologies at the basic contract level that will lead to enhanced competition at the task order level, <br> 3)	Obtain feedback on the use of Award Terms on the basic contracts,  <br> 4)	Additional feedback on task areas that are not being included in ITES-3S, <br> 5)	Identification of other vehicles that duplicate the ITES-3S vehicle,  <br> 6)	Identification of industry standards that shall be met by all contractors.  <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army. <br>  <br> Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly. <br>  <br> 3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The ITES-3S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-3S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment.  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agency are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-3S.  The task areas for ITES-3S are listed below. <br>  <br> 4.

<DESC>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS - 3 SERVICES (ITES-3S)  <br>  Request for Information  <br>    <br>  1. DESCRIPTION:  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command, in conjunction with Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 7 Feb 13 to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. Based on results of information received, the Government is considering several changes to the acquisition strategy for ITES-3S.   <br>    <br>  The period of performance has been changed from a total performance of 5 years to a total performance of 9 years.  In order to incentivize performance, the additional years are added to reflect the use of Award Term for additional option periods for the top performing prime contractors.    <br>    <br>  The estimated value of services within the scope of this effort has changed from $11B - $15B to $20B - $25B.    <br>    <br>  The NAICS code has been changed from 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers to 541519, Other Computer Related Services.   <br>    <br>  There are several task areas listed below that were within scope of ITES-2S and could be utilized to create very specific task orders.  These types of task orders created the potential of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues under ITES-2S.  Under ITES-3S these task areas will be considered incidental to the actual service being performed and will not be utilized to create individual task orders.    <br>    <br>  Program/Project Management  <br>  Strategic Enterprise IT Policy and Planning  <br>  Change Management  <br>  Program Assessments and Studies  <br>  IT Research and Development  <br>  IT Strategic Planning Program Assessment and Studies  <br>  IT Project Cost & Schedule Management  <br>  IT Strategic Planning    <br>  Management/Administrative Support/Data Entry   <br>  Independent Verification and Validation.  <br>    <br>  2. PURPOSE:  <br>    <br>  The intent of this RFI is to:  <br>  1)	Survey the marketplace to understand the number of businesses (large and small) that can accomplish these services as both prime or sub contractors,  <br>  2)	Obtain industry suggestions for a more effective pricing methodologies at the basic contract level that will lead to enhanced competition at the task order level,  <br>  3)	Obtain feedback on the use of Award Terms on the basic contracts,   <br>  4)	Additional feedback on task areas that are not being included in ITES-3S,  <br>  5)	Identification of other vehicles that duplicate the ITES-3S vehicle,   <br>  6)	Identification of industry standards that shall be met by all contractors.   <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army.  <br>    <br>  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly.  <br>    <br>  3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  <br>    <br>  The ITES-3S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-3S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment.  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agency are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-3S.  The task areas for ITES-3S are listed below.  <br>    <br>  4.

<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.    <br>        <br>   For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation.    <br>        <br>   After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities), with hardware deliveries to commence no later than sixty (60) days after contract award.    <br>        <br>   The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is providing a draft of the solicitation for the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) for review and comment by industry. ACC-APG intends to host face-to-face meetings with industry sources in approximately two weeks from the date of this posting, and the details of the meetings will be posted by amendment to this notice.   <br>      <br>   ACC-APG is particularly interested in receiving comments and questions from industry as early as possible to facilitate consideration of items prior to issuance of a formal solicitation.  Industry sources are directed to review the Draft RFP for additional important information.    <br>      <br>   The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the formal RFP will be posted with response dates and   <br>   instructions as applicable to this solicitation.   <br>      <br>   The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, a single Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One-   <br>   Year base period and three (3) One-Year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated services.   <br>      <br>   It is the Government's intent to award a contract in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process.   <br>      <br>   Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.   <br>      <br>   The above discussed intent is subject to change.   <br>      <br>   If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.   <br>      <br>   Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil or donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted.   <br>      <br>   All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified above. Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above. Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.   <br>      <br>   All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned.   <br>      <br>   No Classified information shall be submitted in response to this notice.   <br>      <br>   This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.   <br>      <br>   Responses should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats. If a zip file will be used to transmit the information, please contact the Contracting Officer in advance to coordinate the process, as files with a .zip extension will be blocked from delivery via e-mail.  E-mail messages must be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate messages.     <br>        <br>   No telephone requests will be accepted.  <br>    <br>  CHANGE 2 :  DUE TO FILE SIZE UPLOAD LIMITATIONS THE DRAFT RFP DOCUMENT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF THE DRAFT RFP, BUT IS INCLUDED WITH THIS CHANGE. <br>  <br> CHANGE 3:  PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT <br>  <br> The purpose of this announcement is to provide information about the Project Manager Tactical Radio (PMTR) Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held on February 12, 2014 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.   <br> This conference is in conjunction with Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002 currently posted on FedBizOpps (ww.fbo.gov). <br> The Government intends to address any non-competition sensitive questions and comments regarding the draft RFP that are received by February 10, 2014 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time at the Pre-Solicitation Conference.

The following requirement is set-aside for small business concerns.  However, if we are unable to prequalify at least 3 small businesses to ensure competition, the prequalification process will become full and open. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC), located in Pomona, NJ has a requirement for construction.  The project includes the provision of all labor, materials and equipment to replace the roof and mechanical equipment of Building 287 at the WJHTC and all incidental related work.  The work includes the removal and replacement of approximately 4,800 square feet of roofing over three roof levels and the removal and replacement of the building mechanical components.  The mechanical components to be removed and replaced are the boiler, air handling units, chiller, fan coil units and test cell exhaust units, and all associated work piping, wiring and controls.

The FAA anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract in the beginning of April. Award of this requirement will be made to the responsible lowest price, technically acceptable offeror.  

The performance period is expected to be 270 calendar days, following the issuance of a Notice to Proceed. 

This procurement will be done in three phases.

Phase I  INFORMATIONAL ONLY Preliminary Drawings are attached (Attachment I); the preliminary drawings outline the scope of the envisioned work.  This broad scope is to give vendors an idea of the size of the project and the resources it will require.  It is meant to be informational only.  Also attached to this posting is a list of pre-qualifications (Attachment II).  Vendors interested in being considered for this requirement must respond to the pre-qualifications, and submit their responses in writing to nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov no later than 12:00 p.m., February 14, 2013.  

Phase II  Once all of the pre-qualifications have been collected, they will be evaluated by the program office on a pass/fail basis.  Vendors must meet all of the requirements under Factors 1, 2, and 3 in the pre-qualification criteria to be considered technically acceptable to move on to the next phase.

Phase III  The FAA will invite all of the pre-qualified vendors to a site visit, at which time final drawings and specifications, and a complete Request for Proposal (RFP) Package will be distributed.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in attendance of the site visits or preparing responses to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with the site visit or response to the RFP is solely at the interested vendors expense.

All potential vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management website (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) for consideration of this award.

Potential sources are cautioned that further public announcements may not be made and the RFP along with SOW documents will only be released to the qualified vendors invited to the final site visit.

Questions about this announcement must be submitted in writing to nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov  no later than February 6, 12:00pm (local time).  Questions/Answers are attached.  A question and answer period regarding the bid documents will open at a later date.

Please review Attachments I, II and III to ensure a proper understanding of this requirement.  Also, please complete the Business Declaration (Attachment IV) and return it with the Pre-Qualification submission.

Attachments:
Attachment I  INFORMATIONAL ONLY Preliminary Drawings
Attachment II  Pre-qualifications

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security/Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, will issue a solicitation, HSFLBP-14-R-00001, for construction of a Waste Water Thermal Decontamination System (WWTDS) Replacement for the existing system at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) on or about February 5, 2014. PIADC is a federally owned 840-acre island off the northeastern tip of Long Island, New York, and is located approximately 1.5 miles from Orient Point, New York, and approximately 12 miles from New London, Connecticut.
<p>There is a current need to replace the facility's existing WWTDS. The resulting contract will require construction of a new Bio-safety Level 3 Enhanced facility capable of decontaminating 65,000 gallons per day of raw sewage and animal waste. The decontamination system shall be a batch system using steam to heat the waste to 275 degrees Fahrenheit at 31 psig and holding the waste at that temperature and pressure for one hour. After treatment the waste shall be discharged to the sewage treatment plant at no more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Major components for the system to be provided as part of the construction include approximately 60,000 gallons of storage in carbon steel tanks for holding waste prior to treatment, five 3300 gallon stainless steel cook tanks, heat recovery heat exchangers to preheat the next batch of waste, sea water heat exchangers to achieve the final 80 degree Fahrenheit temperature, a solid separator system to remove the majority of un-digestible cellulose and non-organic solids, and a HEPA ventilation system for the facility. The facility will require information technology and security infrastructure to support a highly automated treatment system in a secure, monitored facility.</p>
<p>The solicitation is unrestricted, under NAICS Code 236220, with a size standard of $33,500,000. Contract award will be determined using the best value continuum as addressed at FAR 15.101. It is anticipated that the awarded contract will be firm-fixed price construction contract. Evaluation factors will include present/past performance, proposed key personnel, proposed staffing plan/organization, price, and other directly relevant factors identified in the RFP. The relevancy of present/past performance and other non-cost factors are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government anticipates awarding the contract without discussions; however, should discussions become necessary, a competitive range will be established, comprised of the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>Other Relevant Information:<br />&bull; The range of estimated price for the construction is between $25,000,000 and $35,000,000. <br />&bull; The Period of Performance for the work will be 730 calendar days.<br />&bull; A Pre-proposal Site Visit will be held on March 6, 2014. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o ALL ATTENDEES MUST PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER TO OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION TO ATTEND THE SITE VISIT DUE TO SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AT THE SITE BY 2:00 PM&nbsp;CENTRAL TIME, FEBRUARY 19, 2014.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61607; NCIC Form <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61607; PIADC Visitor Application Form or the Approval of Foreign Visitor Form<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61607; The forms will be posted on FedBizOpps as they become available. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61607; Attendees may submit their forms to Edel.Brooks-Wilcox@fletc.dhs.gov, with a carbon copy to Erin.Riffey@fletc.dhs.gov at any time prior to the due date above.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o No more than 2 attendees per interested company may attend the Pre-Proposal Site Visit. <br />&bull; Specifications and drawings are For Official Use Only (FOUO) and will be accessible at FedBizOpps only with approval. Instructions for access will be in Section C of the RFP.<br />&bull; Proposals are due by 2:00 PM Central Time on April 3, 2014.<br />&bull; Neither electronic nor telefax proposals will be permitted or evaluated. <br />&bull; Contract award is anticipated to occur by June 2014.</p>

<DESC><p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract to BARCO Federal Systems LLC, Duluth, GA for the procurement of ACIS hardware, including associated program management for United States Navy (USN) and Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customer, E-2C aircraft. The contract will consist of a twelve (12) month base year and one (1) twelve (12) month option year.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is for the supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Title 10, U.S. Code 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &lsquo;Only One Responsible Source', based on substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition for the supplies or services to be procured. The E-2C Hawkeye Program Office is leveraging work completed under a Taiwan integrated logistics support (ILS) effort for the USN and JASDF E-2C ACIS RFD-251 Indicator Assembly including documentation (technical publications, maintenance plan, and drawings), qualification testing results, and developmental testing information. As such, substantial savings can be achieved by the Government by eliminating significant non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs associated with development, product qualification and testing. Accordingly, BARCO is the only known qualified, responsible source that can fulfill the requirements specified herein.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. All responses received within thirty (30) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contracts based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Persons interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact Mr. Tony Hatten, BARCO Market Segment Manager (Airborne), by phone at (678) 475-8027 or via email at Tony.Hatten@barcofederal.com.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to announce the government's intent to award a Task Order for conference space and related services and lodging to accommodate a large number of participants. Each year, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) hosts an annual training symposium for approximately 6,000 attendees, representing approximately 2,000 institutions of higher education participating in the federal student aid programs. These schools are responsible for annually disbursing approximately $150 billion in annual federal student aid awards to approximately 15 million students attending their institutions. Ensuring these financial aid professionals understand student aid policy, programs and procedures is critical to ensuring students have the aid they need to pursue a postsecondary education and to preventing waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer funds. FSA's conference employs Department personnel to train conference attendees, i.e. school financial aid professionals responsible for offering the federal student aid programs on their campuses. This training is part of FSA's school oversight responsibility and increases the integrity of the federal student aid programs while ensuring appropriate stewardship of taxpayer resources. It is anticipated that between 6,000 - 6,500 attendees from approximately 2,000 institutions, will attend the conference.
<p>Please note, FSA negotiated a contract with A-S-K Associates, Inc, (ASK) a small Veteran Owned business, to provide site selection and related acquisition support for this requirement. The contract was awarded under A-S-K Associates' GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract (GS-23F-066J) and a Department of Education Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). A-S-K Associates is currently identifying space to hold the conference, therefore interested parties shall contact A-S-K Associates, at bwalmsley@askusa.com.. Locations under Consideration: Central and Eastern US</p>

<DESC>The M320_M320A1 (M320) is a 40mm low-velocity grenade launcher (GL) weapon system that replaced the previously fielded M203 grenade launcher weapon system used on the M16_M4 series of rifles and carbines. The M320 GL is an improvement over the M203 GL in that the M320 GL can accept a wider variety of ammunition. Its unique unrestricted breech design permits the system to fire longer 40mm low-velocity projectiles. The M320 GL uses a unique modern double action trigger/firing system, making the weapon safer and more reliable than its predecessor and increases the first round probability of hit. The M320 GL can be configured as a stand_alone weapon system.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6,  Salisbury Medical Center
submits a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition in response to procurement request 659-14-1-064-0014.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This is a request for other than full and open completion for the procurement of C. Difficile/Epi 25 test kits from Cepheid.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  :  The Salisbury VAMC requires C. Diff test kits which are used on the GenXpert analyzer owned by the station.  The estimated cost is $13,080.00.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The station purchased PCR analyzers from Cepheid in 2008, and the analyzer is used to test for C. Difficile and MRSA.  Cepheid is the only manufacturer of test kits for this analyzer. A substantial duplication of cost would be incurred by requiring the station to purchase a new analyzer and test kits, and cause unacceptable delays testing patients for C. Difficile due to the validation process required when a laboratory purchases a new analyzer.  The test kits provide results in 45 minutes, thereby decreasing potential transmission time and substantially increasing the time to receive treatment for C. Difficile.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  The FDA clearance database was surveyed to find vendors capable of providing automated PCR C. Difficile test kits.  Two companies have FDA clearances for test kits, Cepheid and Becton Dickinson.  Becton Dickinson test kits cannot be used in the Cepheid analyzer owned by the station, thus Cepheid is the only source for the kits.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Test costs have been found to be fair and reasonable based on comparison to published prices for the same test and the price to send the test out to a third party lab.    

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The FDA clearance database was surveyed.  Vendors may not sell test reagents in the United States without first obtaining FDA clearance, and only two companies have obtained clearance to provide an automated PCR test for C. Difficile.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:   None.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The two  vendors who provide automated PCR tests for C. Difficile are currently renegotiating FSS contracts with the NAC.  It is expected both companies will have contact awards by April 2014, at which time a competitive solicitation will be published to GSA eBuy to establish a BPA.

<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: <br />Requiring Agency: Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC/A6XP)<br />66 Kenney Ave<br />Building 5576, Ste. 228<br />Barksdale AFB, LA 71110</p>
<p>Contracting Office: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)/PL8223<br />2300 East Dr., Building 3600<br />Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): <br />This Justification for OTFAOC is submitted for the purpose of issuing a modification to the current contract DCA200-01-C-5012, with SRT Communications, Inc., continuing the firm fixed price (FFP) Minot AFB, ND MAF requirement. The purpose of this contract extension is to ensure the services provided by the Minot AFB MAF Network are uninterrupted during the equipment upgrades and transition to the Networx contract. This contract extension will be awarded to SRT with a period of performance up to 1-year (from 11 January 2014 to 10 January 2015), consisting of 12, one-month options</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: <br />This contract supports the MAF and 100% of the missile warning communication services for United States Air Force ballistic missile operations at Minot AFB, ND and its remote locations.</p>
<p>Minot AFB, ND supports 15 MAFs with 12, 2-wire off premise extensions, connecting to an Air Force maintained key system. The key system provides additional telephonic and equipment dial-up services at each MAF site. Communications upgrade is required to bring state-of-the-art communications capabilities to the MAFs and improve Minot AFB's ability to monitor and respond to site personnel, security, and associated support requirements.</p>
<p>This modification will extend the period of performance under the current statement of work (SOW) so there will be no break in network support during the contract upgrades and transition period to the new contract. The continuation of contract DCA200-01-C-5012 will ensure outages are controlled, circuits are secured and the interface and telecommunication services are maintained between Minot AFB, ND and each of its 15 associated MAFs during the transition period.</p>
<p>The current contractor, SRT, provides a point-to-point service, providing a secure link between Minot AFB, ND and each of the 15 MAF locations. Point-to-point service contains 12 base telephone extensions for each site. Telephone extensions provide not only base voice service, but fax services and dial-up modems. Dial-up modems allow remote monitoring separate mission and site support services at each MAF location. <br /><br />The Minot AFB MAF Support network is an internet protocol (IP) based network providing digital/IP-based services and must be available for use by AFGSC 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and 365 days per year. At SP locations where the geophysical data is in an analog format, the contractor must provide analog to digital converters to transform the data into a digital format prior to entering the Minot AFB MAF Support communications network. Once the data reaches its destination, it is converted back to analog for final processing.</p>
<p>This Minot AFB MAF Support network cannot be shared or interfaced with other services or networks without the written consent of the Government. AFGSC requires the contractor to provide a communications network whose common points of entry or exit will not be subject to a failure. Such failure will cause isolation between deployed military forces and the main operating base at Minot AFB. The network must not have single points of failures on satellite equipment, frame circuit equipment, servers, switches, modems and routers at the points of entry into the network.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: <br />Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1). (FAR 6.302-1/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 206.302).</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: <br />(a)Description of events. <br />Contract DCA200-01-C-5012 was awarded to SRT, Inc. on July 09, 2001. The contract was awarded based on full and open competition. The contract's period of performance is a base period of one year with nine one year options. A modification was accomplished to exercise the 6 month extension clause 52.217-8 on June 10, 2011. In January 2012 the contract was extended via justification for OTFAOC under contract modification P00017, from January 11, 2012 to January 10, 2013, which consisted of a six month base period and six, one-month options. In January 2013, the contract was extended via justification for OTFAOC under contract modification P00020, from January 11, 2013 to January 10, 2014, which consisted of a three month base period and nine one-month options. These extensions were necessary to allow additional time for unexpected delays in transitioning service of the Minot AFB MAF Network to a task order under the Networx contract.</p>
<p>In May 2012, task order GS00T07NSD0038 was awarded under the Networx contract, which is a General Services Administration contract. This Networx task order will supplant contract DCA200-01-C-5012. The government previously anticipated that an eight-month transition period from contract DCA200-01-C-5012 to the Networx contract was sufficient (from May 8, 2012, when the Networx task order was awarded, to January 10, 2012, when contract DCA200-01-C-5012 was set to expire). Installation of services under the Networx contract, however, has been delayed by several unanticipated events. Due to security access requirements by Networx contractors, additional time is needed to validate contractor credentials for access into nuclear command and control areas. To date, eight of the 16 sites are pending wide area network activation. Of the remaining eight sites, seven are pending final extensions by the local exchange carrier (LEC), and one is still awaiting a final technical solution under the Networx contract. The extension of contract DCA200-01-C-5012 will allow for additional time to transition the services to the Networx contract. At this time, it is anticipated that the cutover will take one week per site once service is scheduled to cutover to the Networx contract. Additional delays have been caused by inclement weather. During the winter months (January through March), weather in the areas in which the MAF sites are located has inhibited team member resources. Due to the remote geographical location of the sites, heavy snows can delay or cancel transition of services. Under this extension, the Government will only exercise those option periods necessary to effect a seamless a transition of services to the Networx contract.</p>
<p>(a) Justification:<br />(1) Minimum Government requirements. <br />The purpose of an extension to the current contract is to ensure the services provided by the Minot AFB MAF Network are uninterrupted during the equipment upgrades and transition to the Networx contract. Failure to extend the current contract creates serious consequences to the national defense of the United States.<br /><br />AFGSC requires the ability to monitor and maintain the following network service and site supported systems:</p>
<p>&#61607; The pressure monitory response transmitter that provides dial up data for the hardened inter-site cable system. <br />&#61607; The vehicle identification link that provides dialup data on the status of the fuel tanks.<br />&#61607; The remote automated weather station that provides dial up data for weather. This is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>All service points are critical to mission effectiveness. A 99.5% availability rate must be maintained whenever the network is operational, and not in a state of repair or preventive maintenance. This contract supports the MAF and 100% of the missile warning communication services for United States Air Force ballistic missile operations at Minot AFB, ND and its remote locations. Any break in services caused by a failure to extend the current contract would greatly impact the effectiveness and eliminate confirmation of nuclear missile launch control of the United States Air Force ballistic missile operations at Minot AFB. Any failure to the AFGSC mission would greatly impact the security of the United States.</p>
<p>(2) Proposed sole source contractor. SRT is uniquely qualified to continue the required work because they are the only contractor with their services currently in place. For a new contractor to provide the same or similar services would not be cost effective for the Government or practical for the AFGSC.</p>
<p>(3) Discussion regarding cause of the sole source situation. An award to another vendor would be a substantial duplication of effort and cost to the Government. The services that are being extended by this contract have already been issued on the Networx contract, but have yet to be completed. It is relatively unquantifiable to put a cost figure on the amount it would cost the Government to halt all efforts of communications to award to a new vendor. It would also be duplication of efforts as all the recent investments under the Networx transition would be lost and not be able to be recouped by the Government. Additionally, the downtime of these missile defense circuits, critical to the national defense is not acceptable as there is a basic 99.5% availability rate requirement. Additional transition time is necessary to insure the MAF circuits are transitioned to the Networx vendor without impact to the mission. The cost of mission failure remains unquantifiable and cannot be recouped by the Government.</p>
<p>(4) Demonstration of unique source. AFGSC requires additional time to allow for Networx equipment installation and Air Force mission track to transition to new contact path. SRT is the only source available to continue supporting the MAFSs and 100% of the missile warning communication services at Minot AFB, ND, without causing mission failure.<br /><br />(5) Procurement discussion. The current services were awarded under Networx in June 2013. Due to security access requirements by Networx contractors, services installation has been delayed. Additional time is needed to validate vendor credentials for access into nuclear command and control areas. To date, new 2 X T1 services are being installed and local site active notices are being scheduled by LECs. During the transition to the Networx contract, SRT will continue to engineer, test, install, operate, and maintain end-to-end service of a global, full duplex, communications network connecting multiple Government networks to Service Point at Minot AFB, ND. <br /><br />Prior to the transition of the MAF service at Minot AFB, ND to the Networx contract, an equipment modification is needed on the base telephone switch to upgrade Minot AFB Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service vice the present 180 telephone extension. This will be done via a separate Air Force contract. The Air Force is still planning their acquisition strategy to purchase installation and activate a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution on all MAF network devices, as the Networx topology is different than provided by the current contractor. All of the Air Force actions have not been accomplished due to end of year funding delays, and are now impacted by weather delays on the North Dakota prairie.</p>
<p>(6) Impact. To award this extension of services to a new third party/non Networx contractor would necessitate new equipment/services that will require additional time for site surveys, power, rack space for equipment and other ancillary services. An additional transition to and from a third party is not practical or even feasible. Additionally, the current contractor would need to remove their equipment while the newly contracted contractor would be required to transition their equipment in place. This would cause various outage concerns and network vulnerabilities; causing mission failures as AFGSC is required to maintain a 99.5% availability rate. <br /><br />6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: <br />The modification resulting from this action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The approval authority will be advised of any responses to the synopsis.<br />.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: <br />The prices will be a continuation of the prices on the current contract for the Minot AFB MAF network support being provided as the level of support has not changed. The original prices were based on adequate price competition at the time of the initial contract award and were determined to be fair and reasonable at that time. For this contract extension, the Contracting Officer will make a determination that the proposed prices are fair and reasonable before any contract extension is awarded.</p>
<p>8. MARKET RESEARCH: <br />N/A. Market research was not required as the Government can only continue supporting the Minot AFB, ND MAF requirement through a sole source contract with SRT. This is an extension of the current contract; the incumbent will maintain critical contractor support only until the services being provided under the Networx contract are installed and operational. The transition to the Networx contract was delayed for legitimate reasons and not due to inadequate acquisition planning.</p>
