<DESC><p>PRESOLICITATION RELEASE NOTICE FOR <br />COUNTER-ELECTRONICS HIGH POWER MICROWAVE ADVANCED MISSILE PROJECT (CHAMP)<br />JOINT CAPABILITY TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION (JCTD)
<p>16 October 2008</p>
<p>THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION. The High Power Microwave Technologies Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of non-lethal weapons technology that targets high valued electronic systems.</p>
<p>Combatant commanders (COCOMS) have expressed desires for additional military options against the variety of electronic systems that are used in military, industrial, civil, and asymmetrical applications. To provide viable military options to the COCOMS, the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate's High Power Microwave Division (AFRL/RDH) is seeking to develop and demonstrate the capability and operational utility of a high power microwave (HPM) aerial demonstrator.</p>
<p>The objective of this effort is to develop, test, and demonstrate a multi-shot and multi-target aerial HPM demonstrator that is capable of degrading, damaging, or destroying electronic systems. For this effort, the contractor shall develop a compact HPM payload for integration into an aerial platform. The contractor shall produce five aerial demonstrators. One aerial platform without the HPM source shall be developed for a flight test to demonstrate delivery, controllability, and fusing. The remaining four aerial platforms with the integrated HPM source shall be developed for flight testing, demonstration, and HPM effects tests. Of the four HPM prototypes one shall be used for ground tests, two shall be used for flight tests, and the remaining one shall be used as a back-up for the flight test.<br />Offerors will be required to have SECRET level clearances, and some personnel must be clearable for access to RESTRICTED DATA, CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION, FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, SCI, and Non-SCI.</p>
<p>B. The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $40M over 39 months. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.<br /><br />FY09 FY10 FY11 FY12<br />$9M $17M $10M $4M</p>
<p>C. GENERAL INFORMATION. The government anticipates awarding one Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee completion effort contract, but reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposal, or no awards pursuant to this BAA. The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified. In the event the government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, the government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror. If the offeror is a large business, any resultant contract will include a subcontracting plan, which must be submitted prior to award. In addition, AFMC 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause, will be applicable, with probable inclusion of Alternates III and VI. The successful awardee may be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the AFRL/RDOS support contractor to permit administrative access to proposal and contract data. It is anticipated a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification with a classification level of Secret will be required during the performance of this contract. Foreign-owned firms are excluded from participating. It is expected that contractors may have access to, or generate, data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, offerors will need to be certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) prior to award. Contact the US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572), or logon to http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information on certification and the approval process. Also, DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, must be completed by the successful offeror and processed prior to award of a contract. All DOE Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers (FFRDCs) and DOD FFRDCs C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory or Software Engineering Institute may submit proposals in response to this solicitation. Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in the proposal that research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that the research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e). For the purposes of this BAA, the business size standard is 500 employees, NAICS 541712. The acquisition is unrestricted, full and open competition. All firms responding to the subsequent solicitation shall state whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a woman-owned business, a hubzone certified small business, a historically black college or university, a minority institution, a veteran-owned small business or a service-disabled veteran owned small business.

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to support the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) requirement by providing a single Universal Serial Bus (USB) IDM interface cable capable of supporting dual channels in order to support digital Close Air Support for Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties.  A critical link in the dismounted digital Close Air Support chain of Air Force Tactical Air Control Party is a rugged, small, light weight, and low power portable computer that utilizes a PC Integrated Data Modem (IDM) to interface with Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), High Frequency (HF), and SATCOM radios.  Currently, the interface between the computers and the Integrated Data Modem is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot.  Many computers in this class lack PCMCIA support and eventually the PCMCIA slots will become obsolete as the computer industry is moving to other interface methods.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to conduct a total small business set-aside competition to procure technical services for the purpose of maintaining and further developing its Hydrologic Database (HDB) System.
The HDB system is combined with a collection of software applications that are set up to automatically collect and store a variety of operational and hydrologic data from various data sources.  Operational staff accesses the data for day-to-day operations and modeling of dams, reservoirs, and related features.  The support and maintenance of this HDB system will require the successfull offeror to possess expert-level Oracle database management, computer programming in JAVA, C, Perl and VB.net, and software development skills.
It is anticipated that the contract type will be indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) using task orders, and a period of performance to be a base year plus three option years.   The solicitation is projected to be released sometime during the 1st quarter of FY-2009, with contract award estimated to occur in the early part of the 2nd quarter of FY-2009.
Potential offerors with an interest in this requirement are encouraged to provide point-of-contact information via the cognizant Contract Specialist's email address:  kmunro@uc.usbr.gov.   
Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR web site, http://www.ccr.gov. or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the
area of Chip-Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA).&nbsp; The objective of this
program is to fully develop and demonstrate robust microsystem technologies for
realizing high quality factor (Q) resonators and associated filter circuits
that reduce the size and power consumption while enhancing the performance of
spectrum analyzers and other devices.&nbsp; CSSA technologies will advance the
state-of-art in fabricating individual resonators and similar devices.&nbsp; It
is anticipated that these advances will enable the fabrication of highly
miniaturized, high-Q resonators in circuits and arrays interconnected with
electronics to significantly improve system performance.&nbsp; Arrays can make
massive parallelism possible and new flexible circuit architectures capable of
much higher performance levels can then be attained.&nbsp; <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <u1:WordDocument> <u1:View>Normal</u1:View> <u1:Zoom>0</u1:Zoom> <u1:PunctuationKerning /> <u1:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <u1:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</u1:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <u1:IgnoreMixedContent>false</u1:IgnoreMixedContent> <u1:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</u1:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <u1:Compatibility> <u1:BreakWrappedTables /> <u1:SnapToGridInCell /> <u1:WrapTextWithPunct /> <u1:UseAsianBreakRules /> <u1:DontGrowAutofit /> </u1:Compatibility> <u1:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4</u1:BrowserLevel> </u1:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <u2:LatentStyles DefLockedState="false" LatentStyleCount="156"> </u2:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <u3:WordDocument> <u3:View>Normal</u3:View> <u3:Zoom>0</u3:Zoom> <u3:PunctuationKerning /> <u3:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <u3:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</u3:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <u3:IgnoreMixedContent>false</u3:IgnoreMixedContent> <u3:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</u3:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <u3:Compatibility> <u3:BreakWrappedTables /> <u3:SnapToGridInCell /> <u3:WrapTextWithPunct /> <u3:UseAsianBreakRules /> <u3:DontGrowAutofit /> </u3:Compatibility> <u3:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4</u3:BrowserLevel> </u3:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <u4:LatentStyles DefLockedState="false" LatentStyleCount="156"> </u4:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]-->DARPA will post a consolidated Question and

The period of performance is 12 months with an option for up to an additional 12 months for a total period of not more than twenty-four (24) months.  These efforts will be transferred to competitively awarded MiDAESS contracts as fast as reasonably practical.  These proposed acquisitions are pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   A Justification and Approval for this action was approved by the Agency head on Aug 22, 2008. A copy of the J&A is available upon request.  The Agency intends to issue periodic updates on the MiDAESS acquisition within the next few months.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the wastewater distribution system for the New Castle Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located in New Castle, Delaware, to New Castle County Dept of Special Services Sewage and Drainage.   Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  The New Castle County Dept of  Special Services Sewage and Drainage (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The wastewater system being privatized is described as follows: The 166th Airlift Wing is located on New Castle County Airport, 5 miles south of Wilmington Delaware.  The installation is located on 79.6 acres and includes 44 buildings totaling 256,534 square feet.  The normal population of the installation is approximately 290 personnel but surges to approximately 900 personnel one weekend per month. The New Castle-ANG Base wastewater collection system is comprised of approximately 8,000 linear feet of sewer pipes ranging from 4 to 8 inches in diameter.  There are 3 lift stations on the base, 2 installed in 1999 and one in 1989.  There is a wide range of ages in the system from 50 years old to recently installed and general condition is unknown.  The base has no sewage treatment facilities, septic tanks, storage tanks, nor leach fields. The collection system contains mostly clay pipe and 27 manholes.  The system contains several oil water separators and one kitchen grease trap that are not included in the privatization and are considered part of the facility creating the discharge.<BR> Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the system; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact SMSgt.

This procurement is a set aside for only Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  The purpose of the contract is to acquire real estate consulting and analysis services from a designated SDVOSB that meets all the criteria of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 531390 (Real Estate Consulting Services).  The Contractor will provide analyses and recommendations concerning the content of the applications and plans submitted by the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA), the LRA's responsiveness to Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) requirements, and the cost associated with ! the LRA's business plans.  The Contractor will further provide recommendation on possible plan modifications and ultimately on whether the Navy should approve or disapprove the LRA's plans for reuse and redevelopment.  The Contractor must possess expert staff with in-depth knowledge of EDC applications and redevelopment business plans, as well as have the unique experience, knowledge and capability to satisfy all the requirements for this procurement.  Additionally, the successful completion of this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's knowledge of BRAC rules and regulations, as well work experience with EDC and LRA.
Intrepid Solutions LLC possesses the experience required based on its past performance and has the ability to provide a continuity of knowledge; the loss of which would harm the BRAC PMO mission by delaying the transfer of properties.  Intrepid Solutions LLC possesses an understanding of the complex project requirements and the multifaceted nature of the development concept plans, as well as the sheer volume of information involved.  It is the Government's position that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.  Therefore, no other offers will be accepted.  The contract will be awarded for a duration of sixty (60) months.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal or quote.  No solicitation document is available.  Any questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to Maryann!  Hough at maryann.hough@navy.mil.

<DESC>Rental of Excel Modular Scaffolding.  Brand Name Mandatory.  Estimated 39 weeks.  FOB Destination, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth NH.
The proposed requirement is to rent Excel Modular Scaffolding for the NR-1 that will supplement a significant amount of modular scaffolding equipment already owned by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS).  Modular scaffolding fits together quickly and can be adjusted to accommodate angles and adapted to other variations needed at the worksite.  However, the way in which it fits together is peculiar from one manufacturer to another.  Excel Modular Scaffolding cannot be mixed with another manufacturer, such as Bil-Jax, or vice versa.  
In order to support the increased amount of ship maintenance, PNS has re-opened dry-dock #1, which had not been used in recent years.  More ships in dry-dock have created a need for more scaffolding.  The shipyard's inventory does not meet the scaffolding requirements for the NR-1

<a href="mailto:wise.william@epa.gov">WILLIAM J. WISE</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a design-build requirement for an HVAC system for the Metrology Lab (clean room) located at the Agency?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The Metrology Lab itself consists of a modular building located within the large soak area of the NVFEL facility.  The design-build project contains requirements for both a standard grade office HVAC system and a precision grade HVAC system suitable for a class 100,000 clean room laboratory.  The HVAC system must maintain precise control of the temperature (+/- 0.5 degrees C), humidity (+/- 5% RH), and room positive pressure while cleaning the air to class 100,000 clean room standards.  The air distribution is intended to provide laminar air flow with uniform air velocity throughout the room.
Design considerations will include use of clean agent fire extinguishing systems not typically found in most HVAC projects.  The HVAC system will function in a cooling mode only and will only provide humidification when necessary to meet specifications.  All controls for the Metrology Lab shall be microprocessor-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) type (including PC interface), providing immediate and damped response to an offset.  The Contractor will be required to conduct various tests to prove that the installed system meets detailed performance-based specifications.  
This procurement is being conducted using the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 36.3.  A single solicitation shall be issued covering both phases.  Proposals will be evaluated in Phase 1 to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase 2.  Phase 1 evaluation factors will include technical approach (but not detailed design or technical information), past performance, and specialized experience and technical competence.  After evaluating Phase 1 proposals, the Contracting Officer shall select the most qualified offerors (not to exceed five) and request that only those offerors submit Phase 2 proposals.  Phase 2 evaluation factors will include technical and management approach, design concepts, and price.  All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.    
One contract will be awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the estimated contract price range is less than $150,000.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  Solicitation issuance is anticipated on or about November 3, 2008.  Prospective offerors can obtain an electronic copy of the solicitation by forwarding an email to Bill Wise, Contracting Officer, at wise.william@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This action will provide both shore and fleet userswith parts and modules for various configurations of the Navy's ruggedizedTime Frequency Distribution System (TFDS).

Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.

National Stock Numbers (NSN) have been assigned to allTFDS modules and full life cycle support is provided to all TFDS modules underthis program of record. The use of any other source for this acquisition wouldresult in unacceptable delays because of the logistical burden of implementinga competing system(s) for fielded equipment (e.g. supportability, training,spares, drawings, installation support, etc.). The additional cost ofintroducing acompeting system would not be offset by potential cost savings from acompetitive procurement.  Therefore, it has been determined that BrandywineCommunications is the only source that can perform this effort without eitherunacceptable delays or substantial duplication of costs.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirementor submit proposals. Information received will normally be considered solelyforthe purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Adetermination by the Government to compete the proposed contract basedupon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of theGovernment.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Background:</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000000;">The GPO is the Federal Government's primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and Government agencies a set of centralized services that enables these GPO customers to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, GPO has offered these publications for sale to the general public through the GPO Sales Program, and has made them widely available for no fee public access through</span> the Federal Depository Library Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The GPO currently is exploring the option of a Print on Demand (POD) process for its Publications and Information Sales (P&amp;IS) Program under the auspices of the Superintendent of Documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The process will include, but is not limited to, order processing, digital printing, archiving of digital files, and shipment of orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the GPO is considering expansion of its existing sales channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The GPO is requesting an industry assessment of GPO's documentation as well as capability statements from the vendor community detailing experiences with implementation of Print on Demand, just in time printing and order fulfillment systems.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The vendors community's information will be used to revise, if necessary, our documentation in order to implement a system beginning in the second or third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2009. GPO's Sales Program currently carries approximately 2,400 publication titles in inventory, and also manages approximately 150 subscription products. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Traditionally, the bulk of the copies for the sales inventory have been printed as part of an offset print run</span>. GPO's plan is to continue to offset print and maintain an inventory in sufficient quantities of the top 500 active titles to meet demand. Slower moving titles and backlist titles will be candidates for "print on demand" (10 copies or fewer per print run) or for short-run "just in time" printing (25 to 100 copies per run). There are approximately 20 different categories of titles identified as candidates for POD. The number of titles contained in these groups, plus titles that are currently low in inventory and will require a print/no print decision, are approximately 400 titles. Going forward, GPO expects to place approximately 100 titles per year into Print on Demand status.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These will include both front-list (new) and backlist (already existing) titles. <span style="color: #000000;">No inventory will be kept for the POD publications as they are to be printed from press-optimized PDF files once ordered by a customer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A repository of POD masters will be created for all information products that fit the technological criteria of POD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The GPO markets to a diverse network of<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> </span>customers, many of whom are purchasing Government information as a reference or guidance tool for the workplace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These individuals are employed at a wide variety of places including libraries, government agencies, businesses, and law firms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>C<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">onsistent purchasers of Government publications have been the public, academic, law, special, school, and Government agency libraries that buy the GPO's major subscription and serial publications. GPO has developed business relationships with a number of resellers. </span>It also sells directly to private citizens via the U.S. Government Online Bookstore on the Internet at bookstore.gpo.gov. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Military history publications, national park books, and Senate art publications are among those informational materials that appeal to the retail market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>NOTICE  OF INTENT :Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Servics Will Satisfy Agency Requirements",  the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) , Investigative Services Division  (FISD) intends  to renew a sole source agreement to obtain education record information throughtout the nation with National Student Clearing house (NSC).   When OPM field agents are unable to obtain education record information at the actual college/university  they are referred to the NSC to obtain the records. NSC  is the nation 's consolidated source for student degree, diploma, and enrollment verification.  They maintain an electronic registry containing more than 75 million student records;  more than 2,800 colleges enrolling 91% of US college students currently partner with NSC. OPM deems it appropriate  to award a fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to NSC.    NSC is the available responsible source and no other source will satify the need of the Agency.   The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NACIS) Code for action is 611710 - 4 Educational Support Services THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHERMORE , IT DOES NOT REPRESENT  A COMMITMENT BY THE GIVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COST INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COST INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a solicitation of offerors, but rather a notice of OPM 's intent to find other sources that may be able to provide information as NSC or the Government will negotiate a sole source award to NSC. This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

<DESC>I. STATEMENT OF NEED
The Tongass National Forest recently finished its Forest Plan Amendment (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/2008_Forest_Plan.pdf). As part of the amendment there is a need to have and or develop a model for projects, to implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Record_of_Decision.pdf) (as described in Record of Decision for 2008 Forest Plan Amendment). The Tongass National Forest needs to develop project plans that allow phased implementation of the Forest Plan as described in the recent Record of Decision to project the development of forest conditions over time to quantify the effects on young growth management as it applies to wildlife habitats and to determine a sustainable harvest level at the project level. The implementation of the Adaptive Management Strategy requires the use of a proven vegetation model with the ability to (a) handle large data sets associated with analyzing forest lands with multiple land use allocations (and complex goal rule sets to be simulated); (b) calculate timber harvest level and potential outputs considering the Forest management goals, objectives, and constraints; (c) project the effects on wildlife habitats; and (d) to perform both cost and revenue (financial efficiency) analyses based on alternative management strategies with potential to help evaluate costs factors and trade-offs as the Tongass moves into young growth management.  We seek the flexibility to account for and generate spatial and temporal changes resulting from the implementation of any alternative. We seek to adopt a spatial simulation model which will help us develop a range of alternative, feasible land management projects. We seek a model to provide information appropriate to the development of implementable designs for actual on-the-ground projects that meet Forest Plan direction and display progress towards the forests desired future condition (DFC). The model should provide a spatially explicit display of the development of the forest conditions and key habitat baselines that move project to DFC. The model should provide a means of constraining and projecting silvicultural treatments while tracking effects on each specific polygon for each year and providing a variety of useful outputs. The inputs and outputs of the model should meet operational and habitat needs and help forest planners for feasible land management projects for our land base. Alternatives developed to implement the Tongass Timber Sale Program Adaptive Management Strategy will need to project the development of forest conditions over time to quantify the effects on wildlife habitat and to determine a sustainable harvest level that allows the ability to incorporate newer deer models, such as Hanleys FRESH Deer Model (http://cervid.uaa.alaska.edu/deer/). We seek a model wherein constraints and targets can be set for both annual and periodic (multi-year) evaluation within a scenario, enabling differing levels of compliance or restriction between single years and multiple years.
II. POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS
The Forest Service is aware of several potential solutions for a vegetation model, including (a) Telsa / Vegetation Dynamic Development Tool (VDDT) - ESSA Technologies; (b) Multi-Resource Land Allocation Model (MRLAM) - John Sessions; (c) FPS - Forest Projection and Planning Systems; (d) OPTIONS - DR Systems; and (e) SNAP - Sale Network Analysis Program, originally developed by Dr. John Sessions at OSU. These are only potential solutions, and there may be other solutions. In addition to the needs to have a model that implements the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy outlined above under the statement Of need the following additional considerations are important: (1) habitat indexes (the model should allow customization via prescription development, treatment responses and timing -- future use of Hanleys FRESH model should easily be incorporated); (2) modeling disturbance (the model should be able to insert disturbance events spatially via GIS layers with potential to be incorporated into software); (3) growth model (while many models can grow trees, the model sought here should to be configurable to use the Forest Service growth and yield model); (4) manipulating individual stand treatments thru time over different rotation lengths; (e) any models may allow individual stand manipulating through database but there is a need to allow this through management regimes, via GIS-based constraints or target rules developed by Forest Service); Other considerations such as software cost, fitting the analytical needs of the EIS, and number of polygons (the model should have enough capacity and potential expansion of data sets to allow for evaluations of small settings and even across the Tongass are also important.
III. INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES
Potential providers of a vegetation modeling solution to meet the needs of the Tongass National Forest (including those potential sources listed in II. above) are invited to identify themselves by submitting brief white papers to help us understand such matters as (a) what capabilities exist in the marketplace; (b) whether existing models meet our needs already or could be easily modified to meet our needs; (c) the buying and selling practices of firms engaged in providing and supporting these models and institutions using the models; (d) the practicability of and potential approaches to testing or demonstrating potential solutions as an early step in a future Forest Service acquisition; (e) the practicability of free short-term licenses for our use as potential customers investigating a product; (f) thoughts on how the Forest Service might evaluate proposals to identify the best solution; and (g) ideas and thoughts regarding the costs the Forest Service might expect to pay. The information shared in these white papers will be used by the Forest Service to determine how we might proceed with an acquisition strategy. This is not a solicitation for prices and products to be purchased in the immediate future; rather, this is market research to help us determine how we might proceed with acquiring a vegetation model in the near future. White papers should be delivered by November 10, 2008, with one copy to Richard Abt, Tongass National Forest, 204 Siginaka Way, Sitka AK 99835-7511, and the second copy to Steve Patton, Tongass National Forest, 648 Mission Street, Ketchikan AK 99901-6534.

<DESC>1.0 Introduction

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) intends to purchase new, dedicated Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) davits to safely handle the RHIB on board the T-AGS 60 Class vessels.  The RHIBs on board the T-AGS Class are currently stowed port side on the 02 level at Frame 115 and deployed/retrieved by the ship service crane. Using the ship service crane can be hazardous and is not the preferred method for handling a RHIB.  This survey in no way commits the Government to purchase any products or services from responding vendors.  The information contained in the resulting solicitation may differ from this initial description.

Interested vendors are requested to address and supply the following:

1.	Recommended davits for the installation
2.	Approximate delivery schedule to U.S. East Coast after award


2.0 Background

There are six T-AGS 60 Class Oceanographic Survey Ships built for the U.S. Navy.    These ships are designed and constructed to provide multi-purpose oceanographic capabilities in coastal and deep ocean areas.  The ships are equipped with three (3) multi-purpose cranes, one (1) articulated davit, and five (5) types of winches which aid in mission performance.  The handling gear is capable of overside operations which include the carrying, launching, and recovering of equipment on the starboard side from midship to stern.   Drawings indicating potential locations for the davit are attached.


3.0 Scope

One davit will be required per vessel (6 davits total). 

The following provides the RHIB particulars to be handled by the davit: 

MFR and Model: Zodiac Hurricane Model 590 OB 
Length Overall: 5.8 m (19'-0") 
Length of Rigid Hull: 4.47 m (14'-8") 
Beam Overall: 2.44 m (8'-0") 
Beam Over Rigid Hull: 1.5 m (5'-0") 
Hoisting Weight without Crew: 818 kg (1800 lb) 
Hoisting Weight with Two Crew Approx: 980 kg (2160 lb)

It is the intent to supply one (1) davit for each vessel so that the RHIB will no longer need to be deployed via the ships service crane.

4.0 Requirements

4.1 Applicable Specifications

The davits shall be Electro-Hydraulic pivoting or gravity davit types and shall be U.S. Coast Guard approved and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) compliant. The davits shall be capable of being located in multiple locations and attached to the vessel deck using existing 610 mm x 610 mm (24 x 24) recessed deck bolt holes with 25.4 mm (1&#1524;) bolts.  It is desired that the davit and foundation (skid) have the capability to be moved by fork truck and the ship service crane.


It is requested that the above information be provided no later than 4:00 PM on 06 NOVEMBER 2008.  Responses should be faxed to (202) 685-5965.  The points of contact for this action are Ms. Marilyn May at (202) 685-5953 or marilyn.may@navy.mil and Mrs. Stefani Nick at (202) 685-5962 or stefani.nick@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION1.0 Description1.1 The Space and Naval WarfareSystems Command (SPAWAR) insupport of the Program ExecutiveOffice Command, Control,Communications, Computers andIntelligence (PEO C4I)Communications Program Office (PMW170) is seeking information on how aninterested contractor could provideNavy advanced Low Noise Amplifier(LNA) technology.1      THIS IS A REQUEST FORINFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI isissued solely for information andplanning purposes  it does notconstitute a Request for Proposal (RFP)or a promise to issue an RFP in thefuture. This request for informationdoes not commit the Government tocontract for any supply or servicewhatsoever. The information providedin the RFI is subject to change and isnot binding on the Government.Further, the Navy is not at this timeseeking proposals and will not acceptunsolicited proposals. Respondees areadvised that the U.S. Government willnot pay for any information oradministrative costs incurred inresponse to this RFI; all costsassociated with responding to this RFIwill be solely at the interested partysexpense. Not responding to this RFIdoes not preclude participation in anyfuture RFP, if any is issued. If an RFPis released, it will be synopsized on theFederal Business Opportunities(FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWARE-Commerce Central website athttps://ecommerce.spawar.navy.mil. Itis the responsibility of the potentialofferors to monitor these sites foradditional information pertaining tothis requirement.2.0 BackgroundNavy satellite communicationsthroughput capabilities have beengrowing at an exponential rate inrecent years and demand growth showsno indication of slowing down.  Userscontinue to rate increases incommunications throughput capabilitiesnear the top of all prioritizedcommunications needs lists.  Toenhance the ability of satellitecommunications terminals to receivedata at higher rates involves improvingthe figure of merit, G/T, of theterminal.  Due to limited shipboardspace availability, increasing thegain G of terminals by increasingaperture size is frequently difficult, ifnot impossible.  Consequently, this RFIis focused on options that may bepotentially available to decrease thenoise temperature, T, of theshipboard satellite communicationsterminal.3.0 Requested InformationPMW/A 170 is soliciting industry statuson conventional and novel low noiseamplifier (LNA) technologies in thesuper high frequency (SHF) frequencyband (20.2-21.2 Ghz) for circularlypolarized RF carriers with the goal ofenabling bandwidth efficientmodulation modes and correspondinglyhigher data rates while consuming noadditional satellite resources.   Designconsiderations of interest include activeand passive cooling for noise figurereduction and may include optionalfront-side bandpass filtering.  Technicalparameters of interest for LNAs are:weight, power consumption dissipation,operational temperature and inputlevels, physical size, reliability, andperformance specifications (noisefigure, gain, gain flatness, 1dBcompression point, VSWR, phaselinearity, etc.).  Navy emphasizes aneed for graceful degradation givencooling failure, and will consideroptional integration with tunable filters.4.0 Responses4.1 Interested parties are requested torespond to this RFI with a white paper.4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word orAdobe PDF format, supplemented withExcel, PowerPoint and .pdf formattedattachments as necessary, are due nolater than 02 December 2008, 12:00Noon PDT and must be submitted toSPAWAR electronically via the SPAWARE-Commerce Central website, locatedat:https://ecommerce.spawar.navy.mil.Respondents must register and selecta password in order to submit a paper.Respondents are required to readthe Submitting a Proposalinformation located on the SPAWAR E-CC website.

<DESC>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and 374th Medical Group (MDG), Yokota AB, Japan. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is April 2009. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director<BR>808-433-3686,  mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B. Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Elastic Bandage Wraps, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $69,869.02. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. <BR><BR>The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>4426 Bandage Elastic Tensor 6IN X 5YDS $13,209.00<BR>4423 Bandage Elastic Tensor 3IN X 5YDS $9,608.76<BR>4424 Bandage Elastic Tensor 4IN X 5YDS $7,824.60<BR>4206 Bandage Elastic Tensor 6IN X 4.5YDS $5,685.12<BR>3616 Bandage Elastic Tensor 4IN X 4.5YDS $4,315.20<BR>3930 Bandage Elastic Tensor 6IN X 4.5YDS $4,190.16<BR>4422 Bandage Elastic Curity 2IN X 5YDS $3,384.48<BR>3550 Bandage Elastic Tensor 3IN X 4.1YDS $3,020.16<BR>79-98238 Bandage Elastic 5 IN X 5 YDS $2,973.70<BR>59160000 Bandage 6INX5.5YD Elastic Self Closure $2,777.32<BR> <BR>At the request of the Pacific Regional Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor. <BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors<BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (POC) Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address to mary.summers1@us.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 5:00 post meridian (p.m.) Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge product samples and no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional TRBO via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D. Source Selection Procedures  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process and program. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Pacific Region. The board is chaired by the Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) and Co-Chaired by a physician and nurse from the Naval Hospital Yokosuka and the Hawaii Multi Service Marketing Management Office, respectively. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. <BR><BR>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. <BR><BR>This source selection procedure is a one-step process. The TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, the no charge literature and no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. Vendors will have 30 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with their responses to the technical/company criteria, delivery of the no charge literature and no charge sample set to the participating MTFs, and submission best value price quotes. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Pacific Region. Vendors that fail to respond to the technical/company criteria or fail to send the no charge literature and no charge sample set or fails to provide a best value price quote will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by close of business (COB) 5:00 PM HST, 30 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment. <BR><BR>All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The no charge samples to be provided are as follows: 10 each of the following Elastic Bandage Wraps types 1) 2 inch wide x {acceptable range} of 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile; and, 2) 4 inch wide x {acceptable range} of 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile;  and, 3) 6 inch wide x {acceptable range} of 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile. <BR><BR>Specific Clinical Product Teams (CPTs), at the designated MTFs, will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The evaluating CPTs, which consists of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and technicians from the participating MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric) and (4) consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. <BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria<BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>1. Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Elastic Bandage Wraps. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes: 1) 2 inch wide x {acceptable range} of 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile; and, 2) 4 inch wide x {acceptable range} of 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile; and, 3) 6 inch wide x {acceptable range} 4.5 to 5.5 yards length, wrap bandage, latex free, Velcro closure, unsterile<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for Elastic Bandage Wrap, Latex Free with Velcro Closure, Sterile and Unsterile. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the regional Prime Vendor will be disqualified<BR>4. Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified<BR>5. Vendors will provide latex free Elastic Bandage Wraps. Failure to provide latex free Elastic Bandage Wraps will result in disqualification<BR>6. Vendors will provide Velcro closure Elastic Bandage Wraps. Failure to provide Velcro closures will result in disqualification<BR>7. Vendors will provide unsterile Elastic Bandage Wraps. Failure to provide unsterile Elastic Bandage Wraps will result in disqualification.<BR>Clinical and Performance Criteria:<BR>1. Product unrolls evenly and lies flat upon application. (Maintain even layers of woven materials, avoiding clumping, creasing or bunching of layers, which would put unequal compression on the patient) Addresses patient safety.<BR>	a) The wrap woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together during the application.<BR>b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <BR>	c) The evaluators will apply the bandage wrap on each other, rolling the wraps in the acceptable circular application. The expectation is that the woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together and cause uneven compression and pain to the patient.<BR><BR>2. Product maintains therapeutic elasticity throughout a reapplication - removal of bandage wrap and rewrapping the same bandage wrap. (Loss of elasticity will require a tighter rewrapping and uneven therapeutic compression) Addresses patient safety.<BR>	a) The bandage wrap will retain elasticity (elastic memory) when the bandage wrap is removed and reapplied.<BR>	b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <BR>	c) The expectation is that the bandage wrap will retain therapeutic elastic memory and provide therapeutic equal compression.<BR>3. The Velcro closure adheres securely and evenly. (Secure and evenly attached closure is critical to the bandage wrap remaining in place) Addresses patient safety and maintenance of therapeutic application for the patient.<BR>	a) The Velcro closure will adhere to the woven material securely and evenly. No gaps between the Velcro and the woven material.<BR>	b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product<BR>	c) The expectation is that the Velcro closure will adhere securely and evenly  against the woven material, eliminating the possibility that the bandage wrap will become loose or fall off; thereby, loosing the therapeutic effects of the product.  <BR>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.
Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
		Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
		2100 Second Street, SW
		Washington, D.C. 20593
		Telephone (202)267-2285
		FAX:  (202)267-4011
Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response:  Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

<a href="mailto:william.prenzler@va.gov">Contracting Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Joint commission Resources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-26. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. Items being procured must be the same as or equal to: For Joint Commission Resources to provide the services of two (2) consultants over three (3) days (November 5-7, 2008) for Medication Management - Medication Reconciliation with on-site consultation, interviews with appropriate staff and a written summary of consulation services, findings and recommendations within 30 days of the consultation.  Scope of Work:  Joint Commission Resources (JCR) will provide a total of three days (during the month of November 2008) to follow up on the assessment of survey readiness based on compliance with the Joint Commission Hospital and Behavioral Health programs Accreditation Standards that was previously conducted by JCR in October 2008.  The focus of this review will be on Medication Management, specifically, the storage, security and administration of medication and Medication Reconciliation current work processes and creating workable solutions to improve the current medication management system.  The on-site evaluation for the hospital on Joint Commission preparedness should include a team of medication management experts including pharmacists for three days.  Consultants will provide a comprehensive review of current medication management processes throughout the healthcare system.  The review should focus on improving inefficiencies, workflow and patient safety within the medication management system. The consultants should assist with identifying and implementing strategies that will improve the medication management process for VACT.  The consultants should review pertinent healthcare system documents (healthcare system policies, committee meeting minutes, environment of care manual and any other relevant hospital documents) and provide a summary of findings which will include implementing identified strategies for improvement.  As the Joint Commission survey process is unannounced, the situation may present that the consultation dates may post-date, conflict or be in progress during the unannounced Joint Commission survey.  If those conditions present, the hospital may elect to stop or cancel the consultation, request the consultant to continue the scheduled consult or assist the organization with survey findings or other activities.  JUSTIFICATION  FOR SOLE SOURCE :Joint Commission Resources (JCR), a not-for-profit affiliate of The Joint Commission, is a dedicated expert resource for health care organizations worldwide, providing consulting services, educational services, and publications to assist in improving quality and patient safety and to help in meeting the accreditation standards of The Joint Commission.  JCR has helped organizations maintain compliance with Joint Commission standards for more than 20 years helping more than 700 organizations across the country.  JCR has long standing consulting relationships within the VHA system.  JCR has worked in many VHA facilities and VISNs throughout the network with assessing organizational survey readiness for hospital, behavioral long term care and home care programs.  They are very familiar with the VHA healthcare system.  JCR will customize an accreditation preparation consulting service to meet VACT Health Care System's needs for survey readiness.  JCR consultants are standards trained and many have on-site survey experience.  No comparable system is currently available as a package assembling comparable capabilities from individual components would be costly to validate.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. eastern Time, Oct 22nd, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) manages the basic research investment for the U.S. Air Force (USAF)</p>
<p>AFOSR announces a Fiscal Year 2009 competition for research to promote and sustain university research and education focused on small satellites (nanosats) and related technologies.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the awards will be made in the form of grants to universities.</p>
<p>Eligibility. This competition is open only to and full proposals are to be submitted only by, U.S. institutions of higher education (universities) including DoD institutions of higher education, with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering.</p>
<p>The program description follows.</p>
<p>AFOSR, in conjunction with the AFRL Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV), and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) announces a program to promote and sustain university research and education focused on small satellites (nanosats) and related technologies. The primary outcome of individual projects funded under this program is the design, fabrication and functional testing of a nanosat. Secondary objectives are to foster research in enabling technologies for nanosats and the design of experiments that can be performed by nanosats in orbit. In a related activity, AIAA will sponsor a competition to select a small number of nanosats to be prepared for space launch and operation. AFRL/RV will work actively with program participants to promote space-worthy design and fabrication and to prepare selected nanosats for launch.</p>
<p>Teaming by a maximum of two universities is an acceptable option. In this case, each university must produce its own nanosat and must apply individually to AFOSR. Individual grants will be made to each university. The team of universities will share as a team the constraints of a single entry into the nanosat competition, thereby splitting available design space between team members. Each such proposal should detail the overall team objectives and the role of each university. One institution should be indicated as the Point of Contact (POC) for team operations.</p>
<p>Proposing universities may elect to design experiments to be performed (should there ultimately be a launch) on the nanosat, including the demonstration of novel space technologies. To determine which technologies and demonstrations are of interest to the participating agencies, contact Kent Miller at Kent.Miller@afosr.af.mil. The incorporation of such technologies is not mandatory for proposals. However, this may affect one of the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>For this program &lsquo;nanosat' will be used to indicate satellites having a mass of no more than 50 kg and with linear dimensions of 50x50x60 cm or less. These restrictions are chosen to maintain a focus on small satellites, to keep project costs reasonable and to facilitate the potential launch of the nanosat.</p>
<p>For further information on AFOSR-BAA-2008-6, please go to Grants.gov, click on 'Grant Search', enter the BAA number 'AFOSR-BAA-2008-6' under 'Search by Funding Opportunity Number' and click on 'Search'. From there you can download a copy of the Full Announcement.</p>

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Modification of notice is to correct contracting officer's e-mail address.Architect and Engineering (A/E) Services - Carl Vinson Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1826 Veterans Blvd, Dublin, GA 31021 seeks a qualified A/E firm to provide Schematic Design, Design Development, Contract Drawings, Specifications, Construction Cost Estimate, and Construction period services for the construction of a new 6,046 square foot Recreational Therapy Center necessary to support the Domiciliary, Long Term Care, Mental Health and other patient services provided by the Carl Vinson VAMC, Dublin, GA.  The center will provide the necessary care for the current veteran patients but will also focus on the varied needs and interests of the emerging OEF/OIF veteran population.  The new facility will be located adjacent to the existing baseball field and Bldg 16 on the West Campus of the medical center.  Recreation Therapy is currently located in the basement of Buildings 10, 14 & 16.  The proposed location is strategically situated to support the Domiciliary Program (Bldgs 14, 16 & 8) but also aligns with the long-term goal of relocating all Nursing Home Care Units to the West Campus.  This project will provide a standalone facility distinctly separate from the main medical center building.  It will be easily accessible to the resident patient population but will also include an adjacent parking area to provide easy access to patients arriving from off-station. This project will incorporate Green Building features (i.e., energy efficient construction materials and equipment, enhanced use of natural light, use of recycled materials, etc) in order to minimize lifecycle operating costs and limiting the environmental impacts resulting from new construction.  Building exterior should be as closely compatible with the existing architecture on site as appropriate.  The estimated construction budget is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.  The area for consideration for this acquisition is restricted to 250 mile radius from Dublin, Georgia.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541310.

Proposal Submission Place:
Mr. Rajesh Wadhawan, Chief Manager-Inspection
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Refinery
Mahul, Mumbai - 400074, India
Phone: 25533888
Mobile: 9833009290
Fax: 91-22-25546003

BPCL Asset Integrity Management Project:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for an Asset Integrity Management (AIM) project for its petroleum refineries and associated pipelines.

The Grantee, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), is seeking to develop a comprehensive program of AIM that it intends to apply at its Mumbai refinery.  This type of program involves world class standards of inspection and maintenance of refinery facilities and pipelines to ensure the uninterrupted, reliable and efficient operation.  This program, which utilizes advanced technologies and methodologies, is vital to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities of large scale petroleum operations, protect the safety of the workforce and neighboring population, and to maximize energy security for India.

The Technical Assistance would examine BPCL's refinery in Mumbai and train BPCL personnel on a comprehensive strategy for evaluating risk to petroleum refineries and related facilities, and would demonstrate a wide range of advanced technologies available from the United States at BPCL's Mumbai refinery.  The training and field demonstrations will be open to select individuals from other Indian refining companies and also to the Oil Industry Safety Directorate, which is the safety regulatory body for refineries, pipelines, and storage facilities under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.  OISD has indicated that, based on the results of this Technical Assistance, it would consider modifying standards and regulations regarding inspections to have refiners apply these new methodologies and technologies to other refineries throughout India.

The overall technical assistance shall: (1) Analyze the current AIM program and recommend steps to improve and optimize the current AIM program in accordance with US and international recommended practices (Gap Analysis), (2) provide the necessary training to Grantee personnel that will enable them to more effectively make improvements and better understand how these improvements will be utilized in their day-to-day decision making process, (3) address several key areas in which the Grantee has identified a requirement for technical assistance and (4) provide a technology demonstration to show how key technologies are utilized to enhance the safety and the integrity of petroleum refining operations to better ensure the reliability of meeting its petroleum products supply obligations to the Indian market.

BPCL is a large public sector company in India whose core business is the refining of crude oil and the marketing of petroleum products.  BPCL operates two large refineries in Mumbai and Kochi with a combined refining capacity of 19.5 MMTPA (million tons per annum).  BPCL also has majority equity interest in a third refinery (Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Assam) with 3.0 MMTPA of capacity.  In total, this accounts for about 15 percent of India's current refining capacity.

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance will include:

Task 1:	Mobilization
Task 2:	Initial project meeting and site surveys
Task 3: 	AIM Program Analysis (Gap Analysis) & Audit
Task 4: 	Advanced Technology Field Demonstrations 
Task 5: 	Technical Training Addressing Key BPCL Issues 
Task 6:	Conduct technical evaluation
Task 7: 	Preliminary environmental impact assessment
Task 8: 	Development impact assessment
Task 9: 	Prepare cost estimates and economic assessment
Task 10: 	Provide list of equipment and technology suppliers
Task 11: 	Training program recommendations
Task 12: 	Final Report	 	

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $370,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The Grantee will provide an additional U.S. $63,310 in cost share contribution, for a total of U.S. $433,310.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, November 12, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.
