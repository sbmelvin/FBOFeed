<DESC>RADIATION DOSE ESTIMATES FROM
PLUTONIUM INTAKES

1.	OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the proposed work is to develop dose assessment methods and computational tools based on recently available toxicological information on plutonium and to estimate the organ doses for use in epidemiologic studies. 
The purpose this work is to provide support to epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to plutonium by inhalation, ingestion, or open wounds by: (1) estimating radiation organ doses from plutonium; and (2) quantifying uncertainties in dose estimates. 
The computational tools consist of computer software that allows the user to derive the intake of plutonium based on bioassay data (e.g., measured urine or fecal excretion rate), and then, by working from the intake forward, to reconstruct organ doses using contemporary biokinetic and dosimetric models.  The computer software will provide the capability of individual and batch (cohort) analysis, resulting in annual and committed organ doses with uncertainties.

 

 
Updates of the current ICRP plutonium systemic model are already emerging by analysis of data coming from two recent plutonium injection studies (the Harwell study; Talbot et al. 1993, 1997; Newton et al. 1998 and the NRPB study; Popplewell et al. 1994; Ham and Harrison 2000), from historical exposure of the Mayak workers (Khokhryakov et al. 1995, 2000; Suslova et al. 1996) and from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (e.g., Ehrhart and Filipy 2001).  A number of modifications to the ICRP biokinetic model are now being proposed for addressing the biases described above (Eckerman KF 2003; personal communication).  
A post-ICRP systemic model has been developed and tested.  The post-ICRP model is expected to be more accurate than the ICRP model, but the ICRP systemic model is still considered the “gold standard”.  Thus, both models will be available for analysis of exposures.  The new post-ICRP model will be incorporated in the computer codes.
While other similar computer tools are available, this work represents an advancement of the state-of-the-art bioassay analysis and dose estimation for exposure to plutonium in the following areas:
1)	The computer codes performing intake determination by regression techniques can work in a batch mode, allowing analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates, or particle sizes of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
2)	A new post-ICRP biokinetic model based on analysis of recent plutonium data from the Harwell, NRPB, Mayak and USTUR studies, will be incorporated in our computer codes.  The structure of the current biokinetic model will be modified by adding or removing compartments and by adding or removing transfers among various model compartments.  
3)	In addition to the uncertainty in the doses to the lung tissues, the computer codes developed here will quantify the uncertainty in the doses to organs other than lung (e.g., bone surfaces, bone marrow, liver, kidney, bladder, and other soft tissues in general).

4.	PROPOSED TASKS, DELIVERABLES, AND SCHEDULE
TASK 1 – Determination of plutonium intake and organ doses
The objective of this task is to develop computer software that allows determination of the intake of plutonium based on available bioassay data (e.g., urine, feces, whole-body or lung counts) and then, starting from the determined intake, allows estimation doses for all organs of interest.  The most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP biokinetic models will be used to determine plutonium intake and to estimate organ doses.  The code will allow the user to analyze either one individual or multiple individuals (batch mode) at a time.  The activity of plutonium inhaled, ingested or taken from a contaminated wound will be determined assuming that the intake was either acute or continuous.  Both committed and annual organ doses will be reported.   To operate the code the user will provide the necessary information regarding exposure such as type of bioassay, number of data bioassay points, the actual bioassay data points, assumed exposure date, exposure characteristics (e.g., particle size and chemical form for inhalation). 
The software produced in Task 1 will represent the first version of the computer code for determination of intakes and dose estimation.  In this version, the uncertainties in the organ doses will be determined using published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston 2003; Goosens et al., 1998), with an emphasis on lung and red bone marrow doses.  
Note that the published studies on uncertainty ranges are either incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues), or inconclusive (i.e., the experts included in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium - Goossens et al. 1998).  Also, all studies on the uncertainty in doses from plutonium refer to the current ICRP biokinetic models (or earlier version), and not to the more recent post-ICRP model. 
A detailed quantification of uncertainties in organ doses is the subject of Task 2 presented below.
Task 1 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 1.A 		Development of a biokinetic database
Derivation of intake from an exposure to plutonium is performed using the intake retention and excretion functions (per unit intake – IRF/IEF).  The IRF/IEF functions can be calculated for any exposure conditions, by using the biokinetic model.  This sub-task will generate a database containing the IRF/IEF functions for given exposure conditions (e.g., inhalation of Type M and S plutonium attached to particles sizes 1 to 10 microns).  The intake determination portion of the computer code will use the IRF/IEF functions from this database to fit the bioassay data.
Note that the IRF/IEF functions for wound contamination depend on the treatment history of the wound.  A set of IRF/IEF functions will be provided to represent instantaneous and continuous transfers of plutonium to the blood stream.  The continuous transfer to the blood stream can be modeled assuming that the plutonium source was removed from the wound after, for instance, 30 days, 60 days or one year after the accident, and of course it can be modeled assuming that the source of plutonium has never been removed from the wound. 
Sub-Task 1.B		Development of a database of organ doses per unit intake
Plutonium organ doses are estimated starting with the intake determined from bioassay data analysis by using the ICRP and post-ICRP biokinetic and dosimetric models.  This task will pre-calculate a set of organ doses per unit intake for the same exposure conditions as those used in Sub-Task 1.A.  The organ dose from a determined intake will simply be estimated as the intake multiplied by the dose per unit intake.  This will ensure an efficient way of estimating doses, by eliminating the need of running the biokinetic and dosimetry codes for each exposure case analyzed. 
The organ doses per unit intake included in the database will use published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998). 
Sub-Task 1.C	Development of the computer code for intake determination and dose estimation
This sub-task focuses on the actual programming of the computer code to be used for intake determination from bioassay data analysis and estimation of organ doses from the determined intake.  This code will make use of the two databases developed for Sub-Tasks 1 and 2.
Weighted least-square regression will be used to determine intake.  This method is equivalent to the maximum likelihood method.  Regression techniques are useful for routine determination of intake in cases of single acute exposures or constant continuous exposures.  The equations used to derive the intake are similar to the ones used in the CINDY internal dosimetry computer code (Strenge et al. 1993).  
The computer code will be set up to allow analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates or for different chemical forms of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
As discussed above, the uncertainties in the estimated doses will be based on published uncertainty ranges in the organ dose factors.
The computer code will be programmed in Analytica® programming language (Analytica 2003).  The Analytica® computer code will interact with Microsoft Access database where the bioassay data can be stored.  The main advantages of using this programming platform are (a) good interaction with a well-developed database management software, (b) availability in Analytica® of a powerful Monte-Carlo engine for proper error propagation, and (c) user-friendly interfaces.  
Sub-Task 1.D		Documentation of the computer software
The computer code will be self-documented.  A short technical documentation, however, will be provided in form of a report.  The technical documentation will briefly describe the techniques used to determine intake and estimate doses, and will discuss the choices of the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake from the existing, published values.  In addition, the documentation will include basic guidance for a user operating the code. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 1
Sub-tasks 1.A to 1.D represent milestones in completing Task 1.  The main deliverables for Task 1 are the version 1.0 of the computer software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses and it’s technical documentation.  The databases developed in sub-Tasks 1.A and 1.B will be provided as part of the final computer code.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the computer software.  
SCHEDULE for TASK 1 
Task 1 will start at the beginning of the project and will be completed within 6 months.  

TASK 2 – Quantification of uncertainty in organ doses
Various attempts of quantification of uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation or ingestion of plutonium have been done in the past (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998).  Some published studies are incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues).  Other studies are inconclusive.  For instance, the experts participating in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium (Goossens et al. 1998).  The uncertainty in the red bone marrow doses from inhalation of plutonium is listed as uncertainty range of 10 by some experts (95th/5th percentile ratio), while others state that it can be larger than a factor of 100.  All studies on uncertainty in doses from plutonium have been done using the current ICRP or older biokinetic models.  The uncertainties in the organ doses based on the more recent post-ICRP biokinetic model have not been estimated.  Also, no uncertainties in dose due to wound contamination have been estimated. 
The purpose of this task is to determine the uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation, ingestion and wound contamination with plutonium.  Uncertainties will be estimated for tissues of the respiratory tract (including lung) and for all other organs of the body in the ICRP list of organs.  
The uncertainties in the dose per unit intake will be incorporated in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above), so that the computer code developed in Task 1 will report both doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
Task 2 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 2.A		Uncertainties in the plutonium biokinetic and dosimetric model
The purpose of this sub-task is to quantify the uncertainties in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model, for both the most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP model.  
Uncertainties in the parameters of the respiratory tract portion of the biokinetic model have been determined and documented by Huston (1995) and other publications following-up on his work (Bolch et al. 2001; Bolch et al. 2003; Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003).  This task will use the information already available for the respiratory tract, and will focus on determination of uncertainties in the parameters of systemic part of the biokinetic model. 
The uncertainties in the organ doses will be derived by assigning probability distributions functions as a description of the uncertainty in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model.  The uncertainties in the parameters will be propagated using Monte-Carlo methods for error propagation.  
Sub-Task 2.B		Quantifying the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake
The purpose of this sub-task is to generate dose-per-unit-intake dose coefficients for all necessary exposure conditions and incorporate them in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above).  This will allow the computer code developed in Task 1 to report doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 2
Sub-tasks 2.A and 2.B are milestones for Task 2.  The main deliverable of Task 2 is version 2.0 of the software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses.  This version will contain uncertainty ranges for organ doses resulting from a rigorous treatment of the uncertainty in the biokinetic and dosimetric model for plutonium.  The updated technical documentation will include details of the new treatment of uncertainties.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the software. 
SCHEDULE for TASK 2
Task 2 will start after Task 1 is completed and it is estimated that it will take 6 months to complete it.  Thus, the second version of the software will thus be completed about 1 year from the beginning of the project.

 Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above. To be consdered qualfied, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess the ability to deliver the kind of activity outlined in the statement of work including the following:  The scope supports continuing epidemiologic study by developing retrospective dose assessment methods and computational tools for quantitative estimates of dose from uptake of various plutonium-bearing compounds that are likely in the workplace.  Potential bidders will need a computational tool(s) shall consist of computer software that allows the user to derive the intake of plutonium based on bioassay data (e.g., measured urine or fecal excretion rate), and then, by working from the intake forward, reconstruct organ doses using contemporary biokinetic and dosimetric models.  The computer software will provide the capability of individual and batch (cohort) analysis, resulting in annual and committed organ doses with uncertainties.  The uncertainties in the estimated organ doses shall be quantified by Monte-Carlo error propagation of the uncertainties in each model parameter
The proposed work shall provide an efficient means to estimate tissue doses for individual workers and allow processing a large number of workers in a batch mode.  Derivation of intake will be based on weighted least-square regression methods.  Both derivation of intake and derivation of organ doses shall rely on the most recent biokinetic models for inhalation and ingestion of plutonium (ICRP 1993, 1994).  In addition, provisions shall be incorporated for selecting modeling parameters associated with the emerging post-ICRP biokinetic models based on analysis of recent plutonium data from the Harwell, NRPB, Mayak and USTUR studies.

The solicitation will be available on UNICOR’s website and www.eps.gov on or about  March 11, 2005.  A written notice of award or acceptance of quote will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  For information regarding this solicitation, contact the Contracting Officer Tatea R. Cavanaugh at 202-305-7302, fax number 202-353-7794 or email me at tcavanaugh@central.unicor.gov .  All offerors  must complete an ACH form which can be found on our webpage at www.unicor.gov.   All Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to be considered eligible for award.  If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your 
information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive, Crystal Park 1,  Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202, Tel.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is interested in determining whether there are any individuals, partnerships or companies (entities) that are interested in providing an order fulfillment service to support an Internet based commissary shopping program.  The preliminary concept is to offer 300 to 400 basic care and comfort items for sale from an order center to be located at the MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) Commissary.  The entity would receive the order via the Internet, fill the order, pack and ship it directly to the ship to address. DeCA would provide a workspace location within the warehouse area of the MacDill AFB Commissary with equipment to process orders and provide access to government product inventory. The entity would provide all necessary labor, supplies, equipment and material necessary to pack and ship the orders.  The entity will also provide a customer service representative to answer inquiries regarding status of shipments and maintain sanitation of the work area.  If you are interested in working with DeCA to extend the commissary benefit to our authorized customers who are unable to shop in a commissary, forward your business plan describing your operational approach not later than April 15, 2005, to the Defense Commissary Agency, Contracting Business Unit/CICDS, ATTN Will Madera, 1300 E Avenue, Fort Lee, Virginia 23801-1800. For questions, please call Will Madera at (804) 734-8024.  This RFI does not guarantee that DeCA will issue a formal solicitation for the service.  Following a review of the submissions, DeCA may invite interested entities to provide further presentations.

<DESC>As part of its contract program for the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), the Centers for Research on Mothers and Children (CRMC) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a contract requirement to establish a Pediatric Drug Study Center to study the use of oral Baclofen for the treatment of spasticity of cerebral palsy in pediatric patients.  The NICHD seeks to obtain clinical data on such pediatric use, which will lead to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling of oral Baclofen for this purpose.

The NICHD already has awarded contracts for several BPCA studies, including a contract for a BPCA Coordinating Center.  Additional information on BPCA and NICHD can be found at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/oppb/bpca/index.htm.

The Studies will include the following:  (1) a Pediatric Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral Baclofen in pediatric patients, investigate the relationship between plasma concentrations of oral Baclofen and clinical measures of spasticity and to determine optimal dosage range and interval for administration of oral Baclofen for use in a randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety; (2) a Retrospective Chart Review of Safety to describe the pediatric patient population using oral Baclofen to manage spasticity of cerebral palsy, estimate the patient population size needed to result in a sample of 100 children using oral baclofen continuously for 1 year or more (in preparation for safety study), use the data to describe the safety of oral baclofen in 200 pediatric patients using oral Baclofen (under the assumption that one out of two patients continue for a full year), and use the data to describe treatment course and reasons for treatment changes, withdrawal, and adverse events associated with treatment and withdrawal; (3) a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial (upon completion of PK/PD Study and Chart Review) to evaluate efficacy of oral Baclofen in children under age 16, and describe safety, adverse events, and withdrawal experiences in children under age 16 using oral Baclofen for spasticity of cerebral palsy; and (4) a Safety Follow-up Study (upon completion of first three studies and review of their data) to describe neurodevelopmental outcomes after 1 year of continuous treatment with oral Baclofen for spasticity of cerebral palsy.  The final number of patients to be recruited and retained will depend on the final protocols approved by the NICHD and the FDA.  

This contract requirement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement incrementally funded completion-type contract, with a period of performance of 48 months, will be awarded as a result of this RFP.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before 03/22/2005 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to:  Jason S. Williams, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier such as FedEx, use 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville, Maryland, 20852).

<DESC>Mr. Chitrapongse Kwangsukstith, Senior Executive Vice President, Gas Business Group; PTT Public Company Limited; 555 Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; Phone: 66-2-537-3915, Fax: 66-2-537-3917."PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE" POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. "PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE" 
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the design and implementation of the LNG Receiving Terminal in Thailand.

The Feasibility Study on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Receiving Terminal will assist PTT in developing this priority infrastructure project, which will allow Thailand to secure its gas supply and avoid energy shortages in the next decade.  Being a dominant player in oil and gas businesses, PTT must plan for new sources of natural gas supply by 2010 to avoid energy shortages and fulfill the demand in the power generation and petrochemical sectors.  PTT anticipates that LNG would be available at a price competitive to domestic natural gas when all pipelines reach full capacity in 2009.  Initial investment size envisaged by PTT for the facility is 3 to 5 million of tons annually (MTA), valued at $500-700 million.  Currently, Thailand fuels 70 percent of its electricity generation with natural gas.  The Feasibility Study will have strong development impact in enhancing Thailand’s infrastructure for power generation.  

The primary objectives of this study would be to determine the LNG receiving terminal's most appropriate location, identify the appropriate technology for the terminal and re-gasification facilities, and define the required level of investment for the project.  PTT seeks to complete a feasibility study in September 2005, finalize the design and construction bidding process in December 2007, and complete the LNG terminal construction in September 2010.  PTT completed an internal study on LNG sourcing strategy and markets, but requires technical assistance to analyze the configuration, state-of-the-art technologies, and investments required for the LNG Import Terminal and consideration of associated facilities.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $667,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background Definitional Mission Report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, March 22, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>S -- Presolicitation Notice for Utility Privatization at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico
<SOLNBR>SP0600-05-R-0020
<CONTACT>Benita Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone 703 767-9407, Fax 703 767-2382, Email benita.jackson@dla.mil - Christine Bond-Jawish, Facility Energy Specialist, Phone 7037673298, Fax 7037672382, Email christine.bondjawish@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, water, and wastewater distribution systems at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 

The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

Installation Description: 

Fort Buchanan is a U.S. Army Installation which covers approximately 746 acres located southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. First established in 1932, Fort Buchanan was named after Brigadier General James A. Buchanan, first commander of the Puerto Rican Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, which was formed in 1900. In 1997, the Installation became a sub-installation of U.S. Army South (USARSO). Today, Fort Buchanan provides administrative and logistical support to all active-duty and Reserve elements on the Island of Puerto Rico.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.  Electrical Distribution System:

Fort Buchanan owns its electrical distribution system located within the boundaries of the Installation. The Puerto Rico Power Authority (PREPA) supplies electrical power to the Installation from its Puerto Nuevo Steam Plant via PREPA’s 38 KV transmission line, designated as line # 3900. PREPA can also supply Fort Buchanan through its main transmission grid via its Caparra substation. Caparra is a 38 KV to 4160- volt substation, with designated lines # 3500 and # 4300 as well as # 3900 feeding into it. Fort Buchanan takes delivery of its electric power requirements through its main substation, which has two (2), three phase transformers; one rated 10 MVA and the other 7.5 MVA, at 38KV/ 13.2 KV but with the addition of forced air can be increased to 12.5 and 10 MVA respectively. The transformers contain no known PCBs. The main substation has a total capacity of 22.5 MVA, however when redundancy is considered, the capacity is reduced to 12.5 MVA.

In addition to the main substation, Fort Buchanan’s electrical distribution system consists of three (3), 13.2 kV three phase feeder lines (designated Black, Brown and Red) that provide primary distribution to the Installation. The distribution system is primarily overhead (OH), supported on wood and concrete poles, however there is some underground (UG) primary and secondary distribution, primarily for the housing area and for street lighting. The OH pole-line is conventional open wire grid with a length of 546,835 linear feet, (25.9 circuit miles). The existing system uses pole-mounted transformers and the majority is 20 + years old. The UG distribution system includes approximately 15,239 linear feet, (0.7 circuit miles) and was repaired / upgraded in September 2001. A small portion of UG primary construction utilizes duct type construction and pad-mounted transformers. The upgraded UG distribution system located within two of the four family housing areas is partially completed and has not yet been energized. 
 
B.  Water Distribution System:

Fort Buchanan owns its water distribution system located within the boundaries of the Installation. The Installation purchases its potable water requirements from the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) and takes delivery of the potable water through its three interconnections with PRASA. The Installation’s primary interconnect is its 10-inch diameter cast iron pipe which is connected to a PRASA’s 30-inch diameter main supply line located near the East Gate. This 10-inch line feeds a booster pump station followed by meter to improve the pressure of the water supplied through PRASA’s 30-inch diameter line. The other two interconnections (connected to Fort Buchanan’s 6-inch and 10-inch diametere lines) are used when the pressure from the primary interconnection is not sufficient to provide adequate service to the Installation.
 
Constructed primarily in the mid-1950s, Fort Buchanan’s water distribution system consists of approximately 169,198 linear feet (32.0 miles) of potable water distribution lines and two ground-level concrete water storage tanks. The water distribution lines include cast iron, asbestos cement, galvanized iron, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from 2 inches to 30 inches in diameter. The Installation has two (2) ground-level concrete water storage tanks which supply the Installation’s maximum day and peak hour demands; one is a 500,000 gallon tank located on the north side of the Installation and the other is a 1.0 million-gallon (MG) tank located near the southern-most boundary. Although the 1.0 MG tanks is in good operating condition, the 500,000 gallon tank is out-of-service and under repair. Fort Buchanan does not maintain a separate non-potable water system for fire protection purposes.

	C.  Wastewater Collection System: 

Fort Buchanan also owns its wastewater collection system located within the boundaries of the Installation. Wastewater collected from the Installation is discharged into either PRASA’s Bayamon 42-inch diameter trunk sewer line or Tintillo 18-24-inch diameter trunk sewer line for delivery for treatment and disposal at PRASA’s sewage treatment facility. The Bayamon trunk line, which handles the majority of the wastewater collected on the Installation, traverses the northern half of the Installation in an east-to-west direction. The Tintillo trunk line, which parallels the El Toro Creek in a south-to-north direction, receives Installation wastewater from a few isolated points. The Tintillo trunk line primarily serves the Tintillo Development and other areas south of the Fort Buchanan perimeter. 

Constructed primarily in the mid-1950s, Fort Buchanan’s wastewater collection system consists of approximately 117,063 linear feet (22.2 miles) of wastewater collection lines and one (1) 500 gallon per minute lift station. The wastewater collection lines include vitrified clay; reinforce concrete, cast iron, and concrete pipe, ranging in size from 4 to 24-inch in diameter. Insituform Company restored all of the wastewater collection lines in 1994 by installing custom-manufactured polyester-fiber tubing that forms a seamless, joint-less, leak proof "pipe within a pipe”. The 500 gallon per minute lift station discharges into a force-main line on the Golf Club sub-basin area.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the electric, water and wastewater distribution systems.

Objective
 
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Christine Bond Jawish at 703-767-3298 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) Increment I family of weapons Solicitation No. W15QKN-05-R-0449 The U.S. Army ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Program  Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM-SW), has a requirement for a non developmental  family of weapons that are capable of firing U.S. standard M855 and M856  ammunition.  The family consists of a Carbine, Special Compact (SC), Designated  Marksman (DM), and Light Machine Gun (LMG) weapon systems.  This endeavor will  be conducted in three phases consisting of a System Design and Development  (SDD) Phase, a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase and a Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  The Carbine, SC and DM weapon systems shall share at least 80% parts  commonality and shall share at least 50% commonality with the LMG.  Each weapon  system shall be equipped with a Multi Purpose Sighting System (MPSS) enabling  the warfighter to rapidly and effectively engage stationary and moving targets  both with reflexive fire at close ranges, and with precision fire out to the  maximum effective range of the variant (Carbine-500m, SC-150m, DM-600m, LMG- 600m).  All OICW Increment I weapon systems shall incorporate a resident  limited visibility fire control with infrared aim light, illuminator and  visible red laser pointer.  The infrared aiming light and illuminator shall be greater than, or equal to the capability of the AN/PEQ-2A. A properly zeroed OICW Increment I Carbine (zeroed to 300 meters), SC (zeroed  to 150 meters), DM (zeroed to 300 and 500 meters), or LMG (zeroed to 300  meters) shall enable a warfighter firing from varying fighting positions, both  supported and unsupported to engage E-type silhouettes under conditions that  include target exposure times from 3 to 8 seconds and targets moving 2 to 4  meters per second to the following metrics: Carbine (moving targets to 300m)  with a Probability of Hit greater than .60 at 150m; SC (moving and stationary  targets) with a Probability of Hit greater than .40 at 100m; DM (stationary  targets, zeroed to 500m) with a Probability of Hit greater than .50 at 500m;   LMG (Hit on first 6-round burst against a single E-type silhouette in an 8  target array, zeroed to 300m) with a Probability of Hit greater than .04 at  600m. The OICW Increment I Carbine, SC and DM shall demonstrate 18,000 Mean Rounds  Between Essential Function Failure (MRBEFF) for Class III malfunctions (i.e.,  for non-operator correctable malfunctions which cause the loss of essential OICW Increment I functionality) and 2,300 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions combined (Class I malfunctions are operator clearable within 10  seconds, whereas Class II malfunctions require more than 10 seconds but less than 10 minutes to clear but can be corrected by the operator with available equipment).  The OICW Increment I LMG shall demonstrate 18,000 MRBEFF for Class  III malfunctions and 1,900 MRBEFF for Class I and II malfunctions combined The OICW Increment I Carbine, SC, DM weapon systems shall have a sustained rate  of fire greater than or equal to 45 rounds per minute without degrading  reliability.  The OICW Increment I LMG weapon system’s sustained rate of fire  shall be at a minimum of 72 rounds per minute for ten minutes without degrading  reliability and accuracy. All OICW Increment I weapon systems shall have a minimum barrel life of 15,000  rounds. All Proposals will include written submissions and test (bid) samples, both of  will be 60 days after Solicitation release.  A pre-solicitation or a pre- proposal conference will be conducted at a later date (to be determined). The offeror shall submit four (4) of each variant for a total of sixteen (16) complete weapon systems, along with sufficient spare parts, to the Government  for bid sample testing no later than the closing date of the solicitation.   Should an offeror’s bid samples pass through the initial and subsequent go/no  go screening criteria, the samples will be evaluated with live fire to  demonstrate the weapon systems’ ability to meet the system requirements.  The winning offeror will be awarded a contract for test quantities to proceed to a Milestone C decision, if required.  After satisfying the requirements for a Milestone C decision, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities (up to 4,900 weapon systems) shall be produced.   Subsequent to the production of LRIP quantities, the Government may award multiple Full Rate Production (FRP) options to the winning offeror (up to 134,500 total weapon systems if the total number of options are exercised). The OICW Increment I family of weapons is intended to replace current weapon systems to include the M4, M16, M249 and selected M9 pistols for the active army.   A Request for Proposal (RFP) to be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil  is planned for release on or about 23 March 2005.  Proposals, along with sixteen (16) bid samples, are required to be delivered within sixty (60) days from the date the RFP is released.  Point of contact for this requirement is Mr. David DeCandia, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APD, BLDG 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: decandia@pica.army.mil, telephone number: 973-724-4674.

<DESC>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS for BOTTLED WATER 001 -   
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


1.  When you mention daily output (in liters), do you mean per 24 hours (ie: 3 shifts) or in one shift? 
     ANSWER:  Daily output is in terms of running the plant 24   
     hours a day.

2.  How much of the production process would you like to have under your control? For example, you can start with the production of the bottles out of PET pellets, or start one stage later, with the manufacturing of bottles out of performs which can be imported from reputable sources in Dubai or Turkey (the largest suppliers in the area - including for household names such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi). Same question for plastic caps. (We have found local supply of perform and caps to be absolutely inadequate).
     ANSWER:  Our intent is to have bottled water capability at 
     selected sites that can meet our requirements.  It is up 
     the vendor to tell how they can accomplish that mission.  

3.  How much redundancy would you like built in / what would be the acceptable down time? For strategic reasons, you may prefer two separate lines fulfill the capacities you need for each site.
     ANSWER:  The vendor needs to meet the requirements per   
     liter per day as per the sites selected.  

4.  Would you want a centralized pool of spare parts, shared by all sites, or should each site have its own spare parts?
     ANSWER:  That is dependent on the vendor.  Our intent is 
     for one contractor to meet our requirements in order for 
     the machinery used through out Iraq to have common parts 
     that can be used by other machines if problems occur.

5.  Do you need labeling and if so, do you have a preference (paper labels are available in Iraq but polypro and auto-adhesive labels must be imported - the labeling equipment is quite different depending on the type of labels selected)
     ANSWER:  I don’t believe labeling is a requirement, but if 
     labeling is a factor then paper labels will do.

6.  Certain parts of the line can be either fully automated, and therefore more costly but less labor intensive, or semi-automated, ie: less costly but more labor intensive. What would be your preference?
     ANSWER:  That is for the vendor to come back to the 
     government on how they will accomplish the mission.  We are 
     open to all options that can meet the requirement and the 
     timeline.

7.  Can we assume electric power will always be available or would you like the solution to include an independent power supply / genset?
     ANSWER:  The vendor needs to include an independent power 
     supply in the solution.  If prime power is available, the 
     government will provide unimpeded access.

8.  Just to clarify, please confirm your EOI would be for the purchase of the complete turn-key solution, and the vendor would be responsible for the training of the operators, possibly the 
maintenance of the equipment.
     ANSWER:  The government would like to purchase the 
     facilities from the vendor.  The vendor will be responsible 
     to operate and maintain the facility.

9.  What would be your proposed payment terms?
     ANSWER:  Monthly.  Firm Fixed Price Contract.  

10.  Who will operate the facilities? Will it be the contractor? 
     ANSWER:   Yes, the contractor will operate the facility

11.  Will the contractor's role end after supplying the systems?
     ANSWER:  No.  The contractor will operate facility

12.  Is schedule, price or experience the top evaluation factor the military has given you for decision on the project?
      ANSWER:  The evaluation factors have not been set in 
      stone.  However, price, performance, quality, schedule 
      will play a role in the evaluation.  The government needs 
      a vendor who can meet the required bottling capability 
      with re-locatable facilities and the timeline of first 
      plant production within 120 days of contract and the 
      remaining with-in the calendar year. 
 
13.  It is not clear if these systems will be mobile, containerized or in fixed locations-can you please clarify?
      ANSWER:  They must be able to be relocated fairly quickly 
      due to changes in manning.  They are not to be left in 
      country after completion of contract.  However, it is up 
      to you how the units are contained.  We want the re-
      locatable capability in order to be able to shift as the 
      requirements call for it…such as we down scale troops or 
      if one location closes then we can move that capability.  

14.  What is water sources? We need to know this since it will impact the design of the water treatment systems.
      ANSWER:  Water is untreated water from either river, 
      canal, or well.  As for analysis, this is Iraq so think 
      the worse conditions.
 
15.  When does the government plan to issue the solicitation?
     ANSWER:  The time frame has not been identified, however, 
     it should occur within a few weeks to month

16.  Can you provide me with the type of source water? Sea, Well, river?  
     ANSWER:  Water is untreated water from either river, canal, 
     or well.  As for analysis, this is Iraq so think the worse 
     conditions.

17.  Who will own the water plant?    The answer is confusing. Is it the intent for the government to purchase the individual water plants? And is it to be operated by the contractor? 
     ANSWER:  Contractor will produce bottled water by 
     individual 1 liter bottles and by the case for palletized 
     movement.  Contractor will provide lift capability to load 
     on flatbeds or containers.  Contractor will also be 
     responsible for shrink-wrapping bottles/cases/pallets for 
     movement. 

18.  What is the time duration for the operation of the individual plants?
      ANSWER:  The government’s intent is to purchase the water  
      capability which will be run in accordance with the SOW.  
      Period of performance will be for an initial period of one 
      year with additional option years to be exercised at the 
      Government’s discretion. 
 
19.  Who will be responsible for providing source water?
     ANSWER:  The government will be responsible to provide 
     sufficient quantities of untreated water to produce the 
     required amounts of bottled water.

20.  Is this RFP covered under the Buy American clause?  Due to the contingency requirements.  
     ANSWER:  Due to the contingency requirements, we are not 
     required to abide by the Buy America Act.  We do plan to go 
     full and open. 

21.  If vendor has the capability of building/owning/operating a static and not relocatable 50K x 1 liter plant and meeting USDA/FDA standards but is independent of your locations but subject to Army requirements, what will be our prospects of negotiating with yourselves?
     ANSWER:  we don’t want a static plant.  We want the re-
     locatable capability in order to be able to shift as the 
     requirements call for it…such as we down scale troops or if 
     one location closes then we can move that capability.   
     Shipping of bottles from one location to another is not 
     applicable or feasible for this endeavor.

22.  Are all eight sites getting its bottle water form one source or plant?  
     ANSWER:  No.  The water is bottled from different sources 
     outside of Iraq and transported in.  This is what we want 
     to avoid.
 
23.  Are we shipping the water to each site or do we deliver the water to each site? 
     ANSWER:   Each bottled water capability must be physically 
     located on the sites indicated in IZ.  The government will 
     be responsible to transport and distribute the bottled 
     water produced on the sites identified to the respective 
     units.  
 
24.  How often to you want the water tested for quality?  
     ANSWER:  It will be randomly tested by the Government and 
     whatever times are required via USDA and FDA requirements.  
     I would assume you already have some standard.
 
25.  What test do you want run and drinking water?  
     ANSWER:  Not sure what the question is…the test ran on the 
     water must meet the USDA and FDA requirements as you 
     mention in question 4.
 
26.  When can we come out to the site and inspect it? 
     ANSWER:  Yes, most definitely  If the vendor believes he 
     can meet the requirements that we are asking for then the 
     vendor can come when ever to inspect the sites.  But we do 
     want to know whether or not he can meet the requirements 
     laid out and the timeline. 
 
27.  Who will own the water plant?  
     ANSWER:  The intent is for the government to own the 
     equipment.  But if the contractor only considers leasing 
     the equipment, then the contractor must operate the water 
     bottling capability within the limits of the SOW.  If 
     leasing is what the contractor is looking at then 
     negotiations can occur.

28.  Would 600 ROPWU’s or other ROWPU’s be suitable for your requirements. 
     ANSWER:  Need to understand what ROPWUs are!

29.  Electric Specs 
     ANSWER:  Contractor will provide necessary generator power 
     to run facility...if prime power is available, the 
     government will provide unimpeded access.

30.  Source of water and analysis.
     ANSWER:  Water is untreated water from either river, canal, 
     or well.  As for analysis, this is Iraq so think the worse 
     conditions.

31.  Packaging desired and available, i.e. bottles, paper, plastic, all container sizes and quantities (one size is preferable) 
     ANSWER:  Contractor will produce bottled water by 
     individual 1 liter bottles and by the case for palletized 
     movement.  Contractor will provide lift capability to load 
     on flatbeds or containers.  Contractor will also be 
     responsible for shrink-wrapping bottles/cases/pallets for 
     movement.

32.  Security? where is equipment to be located and how protected at each location? 
    ANSWER:  The facilities will be located on a secure military 
    compound.  All Force Protection will be provided by the 
    Government.

33.  Will the DOD provide transportation from US and local IRAQ support (BOQ, personal travel, dining room, medical)?
     ANSWER:  Contractor will be responsible to transport own 
     equipment from US.  for local Iraq support, IAW AR 600-700, 
     the government will provide life support services to US 
     contractor personnel equivalent to those provided to 
     military personnel.  Government will provide adequate 
     billeting, access to dinning facilities, access to laundry 
     service, post/base exchange, access to MWR facilities, and 
     medical/dental in emergencies. 

33. Duration of contract? 
    ANSWER:  The government’s intent is to purchase the water 
    capability which will be run in accordance with the SOW.  
    Period of performance will be for an initial period of one 
    year with additional option years to be exercised at the 
    Government’s discretion. 

34.  Is the government looking for private sector participation in operating such facilities to sell the water to the military?
     ANSWER:  Yes

No time extension is anticipated as a result of these  changes.  The following is a summary of the major changes: The following sentences were added to Section L, Paragraph 3.3.3 (a) and are  written in pink to distinguish them from previous amendments:  "The offeror may  provide a seat-cover to protect the identity of their seat.  Seats must not  include any visible markings/decals/data plates identifying its manufacturer;  these markings must be removed or covered prior to delivery." The following sentence was added to Pricing Exhibit PA: "The Government  anticipates a delivery date of 9 MARO for the Integration Testing Shipsets." Lastly, although it is not an amendment, the  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc document has been corrected to more  accurately reflect the clauses that were changed.  Please note, this document  was provided for informational purposes only in an attempt to assist the  offerors.  In the event of a discrepancy between supporting documentation such  as this listing and the RFP, the RFP takes precedence.  The corrected document  has been reposted.   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-13-05) THIRD AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 3.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.         If you have any questions or concerns regarding this amendment or any aspect of  the ESUP program, please contact one or both of the contractual POC+s listed  below.  Please remember to begin any email subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-5-05) PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES All potential offerors are asked to provide a list of all the customers and  subcontractors+ customers expected to provide past performance questionnaires  for the ESUP source selection.  This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the previous posting dates 03/02/05. It provides the questions and answers to four technical questions. Answers to the technical questions in response of the RFI posted on 03/03/05 will be posted every friday until expiration of response date. All information contained in the 03/02/05 posting still applies and remains unchanged.  Below please find four technical questions and answers regarding the EQ-36: Question:  Have Key Performance Parameters (KPP's) been established? Answer:  There are four KPP's:  1)  Range - As denoted in Table 1 of the RFI.  2)  Accuracy - As denoted in Table 1 of the RFI.  3)  Drive-on/Drive-off - Mission essential configuration shall be transportable in a single sortie on board a C-130 & larger mi litary cargo aircraft without disassembly.  4)  Net Ready - All activity interfaces, services, policy-enforcement controls, and data sharing of the Net Centric Operational Warfare Reference Model (NCOW-RM) and Global Information Grid Key Interface Paramete rs (GIG-KIPs) shall be satisfied to the requirements of the specific Joint integrated architecture products (including data correctness, data availability and data processing), and information assurance accreditation.  Question:  Is it okay to use a vehicle larger than the AN/TPQ-36's HMMWV if the roll-on/roll-off single C-130 sortie requirements are met? Answer:  There is no requirement for the EQ-36 System to be the same size as the AN/TPQ-36's HMMWV as long as it meets the drive-on/drive-off KPP stated in the above question.  The EQ-36 must be an affordable, highly mobile and transportable ruggedized bat tlefield radar system. Question:  Has the Army scheduled or will the Army schedule an Industry Day? Answer:  The Army will not be scheduling an Industry Day. Question:  Page 6 of the document entitled 'ENHANCED AN/TPQ-36 - RFI (EQ-36) FEB 23, 2005' states the items requested for the realistic order of magnitude (ROM).  Are requesting cost data or price data for the rough order of magnitude? Answer:  The ROM is used for planning purposes and reflects what would be paid to a contractor.

This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  In accordance with FAR clause 52.219-9, if a large business is selected for this contract, a Small and  Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan must be submitted and approved by USACE and SBA prior to contract award.  The Subcontracting Plan is not required with this submittal.  The selected firm will be invited to negotiate an acceptable subcontra cting plan.  It is the contractors responsibility to provide realistic, challenging and achievable goals to be set forth in the subcontracting plan.  New England District encourages all small businesses to participate as prime and should consider teaming with other small businesses. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,000,000 in average annual receipts over the past 3 fiscal years. Award of contract to the subsequently selected firm is anticipa ted in June or July 2005.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. 2. PROJECT INFORMATION: General geotechnical engineering and related services at various locations in the Corps of Engineers North Atlantic Division (primarily in New England).  Work may include studies/designs or evaluations involving soils/geology; geop hysical investigations including borehole logging to determine physical, chemical and other environmental parameters of subsurface soils, bedrock and/or groundwater; application of advanced geophysical imaging techniques for site characterization and in-si tu monitoring; investigation, analysis and determination of groundwater flow, properties and hydraulic parameters; groundwater/seepage analysis; earth and rock structures, including soil and rock anchors; foundation and earth dam design; seismic and slope stability; dam foundation analysis and risk evaluation of earth structures; embankment instrumentation installation; performing and inspecting subsurface investigation programs; and performing inspections and preparing instrumentation reports related to da m safety.   3. SELECTION CRITERIA:  See Note 24 for general selection process & criteria. When selecting the best firm for a contract, the Corps of Engineers normally uses the following criteria:    (1)	Primary Selection Criteria 		(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence (FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)).  		(b) Professional Qualifications (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1)).  		(c) Past Performance (FAR 36.602-1(a)(4)).  		(d) Capacity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(3)). 		(e) Knowledge of the Locality (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)).  Specialized Selection Criteria for this contract, in descending order of importance, are: a. The firm must have on its own staff or provide through a consultant(s), professional engineers with demonstrated geotechnical expertise registered in all NAD state s (identified above) and the District of Columbia as well as geologists, including registered, professional geologists in applicable states.  Firms not meeting this requirement will be disqualified from further consideration. b. Firms should have capabilit y to provide all deliverables in MicroStation SE CADD software, release 7 or higher, electronic digital for mat.  The Government will only accept this format, without conversion or reformatting, in the target CADD software format and on the target platform specified herein.  The target platform is a PC/Workstation with an Intel compatible central processing unit  and a Windows 2000 operating system.  c. Firms must demonstrate knowledge of preparing specifications for construction contracts using a personal computer based software package.  All specifications for Corps of Engineer (COE) contracts will be prepared u sing COE Guide Specifications and SPECSINTACT.              (2) Secondary Selection Criteria 	(a) SB and SDB Participation (DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(C)). The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardl ess of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	(b) Geographic Proximity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)). Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proximity should nor mally only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  It will have very little bearing on this selection. (c) Volume of DoD Contract Awards (DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(A)). DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.  4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Standard Form (SF) 330 for Architect Engineer Qualifications became effective 8 June 2004, and replaces SFs 254 and 255.  Interested firms being able to perform this work must submit Parts I and II of the SF 330 for the prime fi rm (or joint venture).   Part II of the SF 330 must also be submitted for each consultant.  Please note that a separate Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  Submissions must be made to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Contracting Division.  Submissions must be submitted by 4:30 PM EST, on April 4, 2005.  Include the firms ACASS number on th e SF 330, Part 1, Block B. On the SF 330, Part 1, Block C, provide the ACASS number for each consultant. If your firm, or any consultant firm, does not have an ACASS number, it can be obtained from the Portland District, Corps of Engineers ACASS database b y calling Lavern Brewster-Jenkins at 503-808-4591. Please submit three copies of all submissions.  The SF 330, Part I, shall have a page limit of 50 pages (this limit does not include the Subcontracting Plan).  A page is one side of a sheet.  Font size sha ll not be less than 10 font and margins shall not be less than one inch. The New England District does not retain SF 254s or SF 330 Part IIs on file. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in  the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a Federal contract. Information regarding registration can be obtained online at www.ccr.gov or through CCR Assistance Center (CCRAC) at 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725.  Effective imm ediately, the use of DUNS+4 numbers to identify vendors is limited to identifying different CCR records for the same vendor at the same physical location. For example, a vendor could have two records for themselves at the same physical location to identify  two separate bank accounts. If you do not have a DUNS number, or want to register subsidiaries and other entities, call Dunn and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711. For any general or administrative questions, Mr. MacDonald can be reached at 978-318-8718 or via  Internet at r obert.c.macdonald@usace.army.mil.

E.  Directs the maintenance of a comprehensive accounting system and provides necessary financial and statistical data to the Mission Director, the SO and SpO Teams and other Mission staff.

F.  Reviews the implementation of activities and agreements from the financial management point of view to determine whether project objectives are met economically and efficiently and determines the effectiveness of implementation based on analysis of the use of funds for manpower, supplies, equipment, and facilities for USAID and cooperating country funding sources.

<DESC>Nuclear Facility Decommissioning, Decontamination  and Radiological Remediation

Facility Decommissioning, Disposal and Remediation

The Maritime Administration is conducting a survey of available resources, which may be a single Contractor or an integrated team of Contractors/subcontractors, qualified and capable of performing decommissioning, dismantling, environmental surveillance, radiological monitoring, hazardous material disposal and remediation of the containment vessel, its contents and surrounding areas of the nuclear steam ship N.S. SAVANNAH whose reactor was rated at eighty (80) megawatts.  The end goal of this DDR project is free release of the N.S. SAVANNAH and NRC license termination.  MARAD will engage the services of a technical and administrative oversight contractor to work in conjunction with its own staff to develop and execute the DDR project.

The N.S. SAVANNAH’s nuclear plant has been “partially” decommissioned.  As part of a temporary lay-up, the reactor’s fuel rods were removed in 1971.  Once it was determined that the vessel would no longer be engaged in commercial operations the reactor’s primary coolant was removed in 1975 as part of its permanent lay-up.  Since that time, as required by NRC regulations, annual radiological surveys have been performed.  In addition, the Maritime Administration has conducted annual material condition surveys, drydocked the vessel and performed hull gaugings. 

Firms possessing the requisite qualifications and capabilities should respond to this Sources Sought Announcement on or before April 1st, 2005.  The response should address, as a minimum, the following as specifically related to each of the above areas:

(1) Corporate/Company Information inclusive of Point of Contact 
(2) Current Qualification and Capabilities (Licenses/Technical/Personnel/Support Services)
(3) Project Management, Schedule/Cost Control and Documentation/Reporting
(4) Prior Related Type Contracts (Government and Commercial) 
(5) Past Performance Evaluations and Sources (Points of Contact) for (1) through (4)

Responders to this survey shall also provide evidence that they currently possess, in compliance
with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 and Part 70:

(a)	A Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Quality Assurance Plan.
(b)	A Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license; either as a mobile site or fixed site
suitable for marine operations.

Further, responders shall also provide evidence that they have the requisite compliance approvals and/or certificates for nuclear related activities; i.e., decommissioning, maintenance, repair, etc.,
for the states of: Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia,  and South Carolina.

It is requested that responders limit their response to no more than twenty-five (25) pages.

Responders are herein informed that a two-day site survey of the facility and preliminary information briefing will be conducted between April 11-22, 2005 at the conclusion of radiological characterization surveys to be performed onboard the  N.S. SAVANNAH.  The briefing will be held at MARAD’s James River Reserve Fleet in Ft. Eustis (Newport News), Virginia, and will include a physical inspection of the onboard reactor system.   Responders will be provided with notification of the exact dates and further details at least two (2) weeks prior to the survey/briefing.  Although not mandatory, attendance at this survey/briefing is strongly encouraged.

<DESC>This is a request for information only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. 

The Government is investigating the availability of a telestrator-like whiteboard collaboration capability for the FalconView (FV) software system, version 3.2.  The FV Interactive Drawing (FID) tool should be an overlay layer on FV that utilizes all the capabilities already built into the FV drawing pallet and be automatically distributed to all FV users on a collaboration network.  The functionality would be similar to drawing, saving and sharing *.drw files with the following significant differences:

-	Drawings on any one FV instantly and automatically show on all other FV’s.
-	Changes can be made to any drawing from any FV on the network, not just by the original author, and the changes are propagated automatically.
-	This Interactive Drawing layer is a separate overlay from all other FV overlays, so individual FV clients can open/close/modify personally controlled layers (for example: SUAS boundaries, routes, navaides, grids, etc.) using the FV Overlay Manager without pushing the personally selected layers over the network.
-	The Interactive Drawing Layer should have, as a minimum, a control in the FV Overlay Manager for displaying or hiding the FID layer.

If possible and advantageous, FID may utilize the U.S. Army Space & Missile Defense BattleLab’s Advanced Warfighter Environment (AWarE) Backplane to distribute and manage drawing objects.  If FID does not utilize the AWarE Backplane, then it must still function simultaneously with AWarE and not interfere with AWarE’s usage of FV.

The goal is to generate shared geo-referenced drawing objects that are independent of the map or imagery background chosen by any particular user.  The intended application operates within a dynamic Common Operating Picture and can be continuously updated.  Therefore, collaborative whiteboards that provide only ‘snapshots’ of the FV screen that cannot be scaled or panned once the ‘snapshot’ is taken are not acceptable.  

If you feel you can provide this service, please provide a 3-5 paged Capabilities Statement to Lt David Rohlinger at david.rohlinger@nellis.af.mil ,Capt David Huber at david.huber@nellis.af.mil, and Major Douglas Larson at douglas.larson@nellis.af.mil NLT 1600 PST 11 March 2005.  The Capabilities Statement should address the following questions:

·	What capabilities does your organization possess to provide a whiteboard capability described above?
·	Is this technology available in the commercial marketplace and, if so, to whom is it custoimarily sold?  Additionally, please provide a catalog price for this item.
·	If you have any questions regarding this effort please include them in your Capabilities Statement (this will not count against your page limit).

Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the Government.  Please contact Captain Huber if you have any additional questions.

Multi-Phase Project Planning , Management and Oversight Services

The Maritime Administration is conducting a survey of the availability of Contractors qualified and capable of providing the Maritime Administration with technical support and administrative oversight services relating to the advance planning for and project management of the decommissioning, dismantling (partial) and remediation of the primary nuclear reactor and its associated components aboard the nuclear steam ship N.S. Savannah.  A Level of Effort type contract consisting of reimbursable type line items (CLINs) as a well as firm fixed priced line items (CLINs) is anticipated for these services. 

A target date for commencing the decommissioning, decontamination and radiological remediation (DDR) is October 1, 2006.  The ultimate goal of the project is to free release the N.S. SAVANNAH and complete termination of its NRC license, thus rendering the N.S. Savannah, inclusive of its nuclear power plant, suitable for use as a national maritime museum.

The N.S. Savannah’s nuclear plant was rated at eighty (80) megawatts and has been “partially” decommissioned.  As part of a temporary lay-up, the reactor’s fuel rods were removed in 1971.  Once it was determined that the vessel would no longer be engaged in commercial operations; the reactor’s primary coolant was removed in 1975 as part of its permanent lay-up.  Since that time, as required by NRC regulations, annual radiological surveys have been performed.  In addition, the Maritime Administration has conducted annual material condition surveys, drydocked the vessel and performed hull gaugings.   As a precursor to the decommissioning, a comprehensive characterization survey of the reactor pressure vessel, the containment space and components therein, as well as secondary spaces near or adjacent to the containment vessel, is currently being performed. .
 
Those firms possessing the requisite qualifications and capabilities should respond to this Sources Sought Announcement on or before April 15th, 2005. The response should include, as a minimum, the following:

(1) Corporate/Company Information inclusive of Point of Contact 
(2) Current Qualification and Capabilities (Technical/Personnel/Support Services)
(3) Project Management, Scheduling/Cost Estimating and Documentation/Reporting
(4) Prior Related Type Contracts (Government and Commercial) 
(5) Past Performance Evaluations and Sources (Points of Contact) for (1) through (4)

For each of the above, the response should specifically address the following technical elements:

(a)	Advance DDR Planning/Project Scheduling/NRC Document(s) Preparation and Review 
(b)	DDR Scheduling and Cost Estimating
(c)	DDR Environmental Assessment
(d)	DDR Contract Oversight
(i)	Site Environmental Monitoring
(ii)	Waste Management
(iii)	Disposition and Tracking of Nuclear Materials
(iv)	Emergency Response
(v)	DDR Contractor Performance Assessment
(e)	NRC License Termination Requirements and Process

In compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 and Part 70; responders to this survey shall also provide evidence that they currently possess a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Quality Assurance Plan(s).

It is requested that responders limit their response to no more than twenty-five (25) pages.

Responders are herein informed that a two-day site survey of the facility and preliminary information briefing will be conducted between April 11-22, 2005 at the conclusion of radiological characterization surveys to be performed onboard the  N.S. SAVANNAH.  The briefing will be held at MARAD’s James River Reserve Fleet in Ft. Eustis (Newport News), Virginia, and will include a physical inspection of the onboard reactor system.   Responders will be provided with notification of the exact dates and further details at least two (2) weeks prior to the survey/briefing.  Although not mandatory, attendance at this survey/briefing is strongly encouraged.

<SUBJECT>D -- NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-SoleSource-SDS
<RESPDATE>031105
<ARCHDATE>03122005
<CONTACT>Randall Pickwell, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109661325, Fax 4109659560, Email randall.pickwell@ssa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS: The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Smart Document Solutions (SDS) of 120 Bluegrass Valley Parkway, Alpharetta, GA for specific specialized electronic data transfer services. These services involve transfer of complex medical records between health service providers, the Social Security Administration (SSA), multiple state agency Disability Determination Service (DDS) locations, and other interested parties in support of SSA’s accelerated electronic disability benefits (AeDib) project. The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published a sources sought synopsis (posted to www.fedbizopps.gov on January 3-, 2004 under synopsis reference number: SDS04-CCS) to identify alternative sources of supply for these specialized services. This research has demonstrated to the SSA that SDS is the only company capable of meeting the Government’s requirements. At the conclusion of this previous market research SSA awarded a 3-month sole source contract to SDS for a Proof of Concept (POC) pilot for demonstration of these specialized medical data transfer services. During the POC pilot phase SDS successfully demonstrated a proprietary process for specialized medical data transfers in multiple locations in selected states. To fully demonstrate the capabilities of SDS’ proprietary technologies and processes the SSA now intends to award a follow-on, one-year sole source contract to SDS for continued demonstration of specialized medical data transfer services on a further expanded scope and scale. 

This expanded one-year follow-on contract will demonstrate SDS’ prototype abilities to provide at least 80% of the state DDS locations with scanned images of medical records from multiple major medical providers nationwide. The ability to transfer scanned images of records will be available at the start of the prototype for each DDS.  SDS currently has in place contracts with medical facilities nationwide to provide medical data transfer services of a similar type nationwide that allow the prototype to be demonstrated on such a scale. SDS will be offering multiple channels to provide these images to all states.  Each DDS will be selecting from paper, an existing SDS website, and the new prototype process.  The value added of the prototype channel over paper or vendor maintained website will be assessed during the prototype. These channels must all exist at the start of the prototype. All images transferred will be formatted for SSA in an SSA specific format (tiff, group 4 compression).  Images for each DDS location will be zipped in groups and include an SSA specific XML data header. The information in this data header is obtained by reading the SSA barcode, or identifying the non-existence of an appropriate barcode and taking appropriate measures to obtain the required information. Accuracy rate for the standard SSA barcode must meet or exceed 93%. Transmission of medial data to SSA will occur from a central data center.  Records will be delivered to the SSA’s National Computer Center in Woodlawn, MD using Sterling America’s proprietary file software product CONNECT:Direct. The appropriate scripts will then be invoked within specific parameters and SSA will pick up the files in accordance with agreed specifications.

Any responsible firm that provides specialized medical data transfer services capable of meeting or exceeding the minimum performance specifications described herein is invited to respond in writing via e-mail to: Randall.Pickwell@SSA.GOV no later than COB March 11, 2005. Written responses must provide clear, concise, and complete documentation indicating that firm’s capability to provide the above referenced specialized medical data transfer services. Respondents must also provide specific examples of their experience in providing specialized medical data transfer services of the type described herein with proof of existing contracts with medical facilities nationwide that allow for demonstration of their capabilities.  Respondents that merely provide a potential plan for providing these services will not be considered. Simple marketing information, incomplete responses, or references to vendor web sites for further information will not be considered. Pricing data is not requested or required in responses to this notice. All responses meeting these criteria will be fully considered. The Government will not pay for information received in response to this notice. All responses shall be marked “CAPABILITY STATEMENT- Medical Data Transfer Services”. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FORTHCOMING SOLICITATION. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no suitable responses are received by the cutoff date listed herein, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with SDS. Again, all submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed herein. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

For further information, contact the:  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Office of Technology Partnerships, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 2200, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899; Fax:  301-869-2751.  This is not an announcement of a contract action or a grant.

**NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 01-029CIP1

Title:  Mixing Reactions by Temperature Gradient Focusing

Description:  	The new use of TGF in this invention involves analyte-ligand interactions that occur as a result of focusing one (the ligand or analyte) and allowing interactions with the second (analyte or ligand) to occur.  The mixing interaction can be a hybridization event between nucleic acids such as single stranded DNA/DNA or DNA/peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a chemical reaction, an enzyme/substrate reaction, a protein/protein, or drug/target interaction.  In addition, moving the focused product through the temperature gradient after mixing allows additional information to be inferred if the assay displays a temperature dependent interaction (i.e. nucleic acid duplex melting or precipitation of thermoresponsive polymers).


**NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 01-029CIP2

Title:  Chiral Temperature Gradient Focusing

Description:  	The invention describes a variant of temperature gradient focusing that uses chirally selective additives to modify the electrophoretic mobility of analytes thereby providing a method for focusing and separation of analytes based on their chirality.


**NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 04-018

Title: 	Solid State Radiance Calibration Source

Description:  	With the development of light-emitting diodes (LED) at many different wavelengths, compact, quasi-monochromatic sources can be developed for radiometric uses.  Temporally stable, spatially uniform and radiometrically calibrated sources are needed in many different applications.  Instead of using large integrating sphere sources, such radiance sources can also be used to measure the size-of-source effect (SSE) in radiation thermometers.  These compact sources can be used for both initial characterizations and for periodic measurements to determine that the SSE has not changed.  This invention describes the design, construction, and characterization of a unique LED-based radiance source (LRS).  Different diffuser materials are assessed for spatial and angular uniformity.

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, apply to this solicitation and is amended as follows: Paragraph (b) (10), Each offeror will be required to have three (3) references, of the most relevant (relevancy defined below) contracts performed within the last three years from the date of issuance of this posting, submit the attached past performance questionaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 6 of this posting.  Informal teaming arrangements will not be considered.  Joint ventures/teaming arrangements must be formalized in writing and approved by the Small Business Administration.  Offerors will be determined to be technically acceptable by submitting a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and SOW.   Offerors that fail to furnish this statement, required representations and certifications or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation will be excluded from further consideration and deemed technically unacceptable The following relevancy definitions apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involved multimedia services support for an active duty Air Force Technical Training Wing or other service equivalent that included daily operation of still photo lab, computer based graphics work center, utilizing both Microsoft, and Macintosh operating systems, Video Teleconference (VTC) support, multimedia equipment maintenance, government furnished property management, and operation of Commanders Access Television Channel.  Relevant:   Past/present performance effort involved multimedia services support for any Air Force Wing or other service equivalent or civilian educational institution and included daily operation of still photo lab, computer based graphics work center, utilizing both Microsoft, and Macintosh operating systems, and Video Teleconference (VTC) support.   Somewhat Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involved multimedia services support for any military or civilian organization.  Past/present performance must have included some from of multimedia services described in above relevancy definitions.  Not Relevant:  Past/present performance effort did not involve any multimedia services.  
5.	Basis for Award:  (a) This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance Price Trade-off (PPT).  For proposals determined technically acceptable (as defined in paragraph 4 of this posting), a trade-off between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price considerations.  (b) An offeror will be determined technically acceptable in accordance with paragraph 4 of this posting.  (c) Offerors shall propose on CLIN 0001.  (d) Only firm fixed price quotes will be evaluated.  A quote using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.  (e) The application of Performance/Price Trade-off procedures in the contract award selection and approval process is as follows: 1)  All technically acceptable quotes will be ranked by evaluated price. Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished (see paragraph (h), will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 2)  Then, all technically acceptable quotes will receive a performance confidence assessment rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.  The ratings are defined in paragraph 4 of this posting.  3)  A trade-off process is then conducted.  The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.  A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror as discussed in paragraph 4 of this posting is received.  In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.  (f) Performance Confidence Assessment:  The Government will conduct an assessment of performance confidence based on the offeror's recent and relevant performance.  In assessing performance confidence, the evaluator will (1) seek present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires, and (2) use data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources, if available.  The purpose of the assessment is to identify and review relevant present and past performance and then make an overall confidence assessment of the offeror's ability to perform this effort.  The assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating of exceptional/high confidence, very good/significant confidence, satisfactory/confidence, neutral/unknown confidence, marginal/little confidence, or unsatisfactory/no confidence.  An offeror with no relevant past performance history may receive a rating of neutral.  However, a higher than neutral rating may be achieved if a proposed subcontractor who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a successful performance history on relevant contracts.  The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence risk assessment will consider the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.  (g) Past performance evaluation will be conducted using one of the following procedures: (1) If discussions will not be conducted, past performance will be evaluated on the lowest reasonable priced technically acceptable quote.  If that lowest priced offeror is judged to have exceptional performance risk rating, that quote represents the best value to the government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award will be made to that offeror.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable quote is not rated exceptional, then all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Questions and answers to date:

1. I had a quick question about the NAICS code used to determine the small business size.  You used a NAICS code of 334119 which is for manufacturing.  The manufacturing code doesn't apply since you are soliciting quotes only from small business, none of whom manufacture Cisco equipment. I feel the appropriate NAICS code should be 541519 (IT VAR) with a small business standard of 150 employees or less, or you could choose 423430
(Computer Peripheral Equipment Wholesaling) which has a size standard of 500 employees or less for Government contracting.

Answer:  The NAICS code chosen for this project was suggested by the SBA contact for making those determinations.

(e) The application of Performance/Price Trade-off procedures in the contract award selection and approval process is as follows: 1)  All technically acceptable quotes will be ranked by evaluated price. Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished (see paragraph (h), will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 2)  Then, all technically acceptable quotes will receive a performance confidence assessment rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.  The ratings are defined in paragraph 4 of this posting.  3)  A trade-off process is then conducted.  The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.  A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror as discussed in paragraph 4 of this posting is received.  In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.  (f) Performance Confidence Assessment:  The Government will conduct an assessment of performance confidence based on the offeror's recent and relevant performance.  In assessing performance confidence, the evaluator will (1) seek present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires, and (2) use data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources, if available.  The purpose of the assessment is to identify and review relevant present and past performance and then make an overall confidence assessment of the offeror's ability to perform this effort.  The assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating of exceptional/high confidence, very good/significant confidence, satisfactory/confidence, neutral/unknown confidence, marginal/little confidence, or unsatisfactory/no confidence.  An offeror with no relevant past performance history may receive a rating of neutral.  However, a higher than neutral rating may be achieved if a proposed subcontractor who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a successful performance history on relevant contracts.  The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence risk assessment will consider the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.  (g) Past performance evaluation will be conducted using one of the following procedures: (1) If discussions will not be conducted, past performance will be evaluated on the lowest reasonable priced technically acceptable quote.  If that lowest priced offeror is judged to have exceptional performance risk rating, that quote represents the best value to the government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award will be made to that offeror.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable quote is not rated exceptional, then all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.  In that event, the contracting officer will make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.  The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  (h) Price:  Each offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism.  	(1) Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, as appropriate.  (2) Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  (i) The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.
