<SUBJECT>A -- Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER)
<SOLNBR>BAA07-17
<RESPDATE>042307
<ARCHDATE>01242008
<CONTACT>Mike Haney, Program Manager, MTO, Phone 571-218-4813, Fax 703-248-8053, Email Mike.Haney@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The objective of the PhASER program is to develop a fundamental photonic integrated circuit (PIC), termed Unit Cell, which can act as a reconfigurable building block in the formation of a high-throughput, low-power, analog signal processor.  The intent of this program is to enable scalable PIC-based analog signal processors that overcome the limits of conventional Silicon-based digital signal processing technology.  Specific program goals include:

-       Definition of a photonic analog signal-processing engine Unit Cell which is comprised of waveguide-connected, programmable, active photonic elements. These unit cells should enable basic filtering operations on their own or arbitrarily complex filter operations when connected within a large array of Unit Cells;
-	Development of a program plan that will permit the fabrication, testing, and evaluation of the Unit Cell;
-	Description of how the Unit Cell, when arrayed within a high-density PIC, will scale and meet the PhASER filter challenge problem, as well as how the Unit Cells will be programmed and tested at the chip-level to ensure high yield;  
-	Development of a filter synthesis tool to demonstrate how Unit Cells will perform in the context of generalized high-order filters.
-	Implementation of a technical approach to experimentally demonstrate the Unit Cell performance milestones; 

DARPA may consider compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned PhASER.

The PhASER program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. Demonstration of photonic filtering technology; 
II. Filter Algorithms; 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 07-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet referred below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Photonic Analog Signal-Processing Engines with Reconfigurability (PhASER) program will consist of a single phase whose focus is on the development and demonstration of the PhASER Unit Cell.  Supporting tasks will include the development and demonstration of a filter synthesis software tool, and a related transition plan.  Proposers must define a realistic schedule and budget to meet the milestone and deliverable schedule.  It is recommended that the proposed program plan include interim milestones at approximately the halfway point of the program. Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to: photonic and electronic device design, fabrication, and packaging; filter design and integration; and military sensor processing system analysis are strongly encouraged.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Michael Haney, phone: (571) 218-4813, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: Mike.Haney@darpa.mil.

18.	THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure CLS, consisting of Airframe Depot, Engine Depot and Site Support services, for Navy and Marine C-9B/DC-9 aircraft, USAF C-9 aircraft and one NASA C-9 aircraft.  The Navy and Marines currently operate 17 C-9Bs and 2 DC9s, USAF operates 4 C-9As and 3 C-9Cs, and NASA operates 1 DC-9aircraft.   There are three distinct efforts to be procured under this CLS solicitation (Airframe Depot, Engine Depot, and Site Support). (a) Site support at; Atlanta NAS, Norfolk NAS, Whidbey Island NAS, Willow Grove NAS, Cherry Point MCAS, Scott AFB, and Andrews AFB.  The site support effort consists of issuing parts and materials, assembling kits, receiving items for repair or overhaul, and providing replenishment services at each on-site storeroom.  The Government owns a considerable inventory of parts that are managed by the site support contractor. (b) Airframe depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9 aircraft operational requirements (SDLMs, PDMs, MTIs) and unscheduled maintenance.  Also included will be field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors.  Note that two Navy DC-9s are slated for retirement during this performance period but will require normal services until that time.  (c) Engine depot services of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines such as unscheduled and scheduled engine shop visits.  Also included is field team support for repairs away from the depot facility. (d) Also to be included in this solicitation is limited material management services for the Navy C-9 simulator/trainer located at Colorado Springs, Colorado.  During the period of performance of this contract, aircraft will be retired (divestiture) and one or more sites may be closed.  The Navy is replacing the C-9s with C-40 aircraft.  This replacement schedule is driven by the C-40 aircraft acquisition schedule.  The C-40 acquisition schedule is volatile and subject to constant changes that cannot be predicted.

The contract will be for a base year plus 4 option years. Consideration is also being given to extending the length of the contract for up to ten years (base and up to nine options).  The contract will be a commercial like contract issued under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government believes that use of the Part 12 procedures will eliminate many of the potential barriers preventing or discouraging commercial companies from considering this requirement.  It will be an indefinite delivery type contract with a minimum ordering requirement for the base year only that is yet to be determined. The Government will place orders for site support, aircraft depot maintenance, engine depot maintenance and related work as part of the ordering provisions of the contract.  The contract will include the ability to order modification work for aircraft or engine modifications but the Government makes no assertion that this type of work will be done on this proposed contract.  The C-9 aircraft is the military version of the commercial DC-9 series aircraft manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation and is an FAA type-certificated DC-9-32F aircraft. Parts and material are commercially available. Manuals and maintenance documentation will be provided to the contractor upon award, however; the contractor must obtain a licensing agreement with the OEM for engineering support. All contractor facilities must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. 

A draft solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website in the JUL/AUG 05 timeframe.  Various RFP documents will also be posted prior to and after the draft RFP.  Accordingly, companies should continuously monitor the NAVAIR web site at www.navair.navy.mil.  Then click on “Doing Business” and then “Open Solicitations.”   Formal RFP release is set for OCT 05 with proposal submittal due in early JAN 06.  Contract award is planned for JUN/JUL 06 to allow for a 90 day phase-in period for a new contractor, if applicable, with site and depot efforts to begin in OCT 06 (Government FY 07).

QUESTION FOR INDUSTRY –  We request that responses to the following question be provided by 2 MAY 2005 to support release of the draft RFP in the JUL/AUG timeframe:  
1. As part of this announcement, the Government requests your input on use of a contract that is six to ten years in length.  Please provide your assessment of advantages and/or disadvantages as well as pricing concerns and other terms and conditions that you believe would be critical to a contract longer then five years.   

Responses should be forwarded to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A. Moffett Building, Attn:  Jason Lev, CODE:  AIR-2.4.3.1, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg, 2272, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1607 or Jason.lev @navy.mil.  Electronic responses are preferred.  Submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government.  Submissions will not be returned.

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision "... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ..."  The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions. The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities, extending both to fixed shore facilities and to highly mobile air, surface, land and subsurface platforms, including the so-called "disadvantaged user", e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs),  dispersed ground units in radio frequency (RF) challenged environments, etc. 

The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 312) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance mission-critical connectivity among such widely dispersed naval, joint, allied and coalition forces. With an overarching emphasis on wireless terrestrial, maritime and satellite communications and networking, ONR 312 is seeking white papers for potential FY 08 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects under the following  focus area: Electrically small and light weight antenna technologies in the ELF/VLF (100 Hz-10 KHz) band for subsurface to surface/aerial communications. Higher radiating efficiency is required, for example, to maintain adequate Signal-to-Noise ratio in a UAV to submarine communications link, due to SWaP (size, weight and power) constraints in the tactical edge. Technologies and approaches may include, amongst others, metamaterials, active circuitry, ATL (artificial transmission line), new geometries and volumetric designs. 

ONR is also receptive to highly innovative ideas in other general communications and networking areas  that is not designated focus as above, but nevertheless important to Navy/Marine Corps, such as the following (these are not in any priority order): (i) Advanced modulation, coding, equalization, co-site interference mitigation, and power amplification to improve mobile wireless link performance, bandwidth efficiency and spectral containment, while reducing form-factor and energy consumption; (ii) Cognitive radios and agile frequency communications, bandwidth management;  (iii) Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) spectral efficiency improvement to Gbps operation and TCDL multipath mitigation; (iv) Fundamental issues in tactical edge MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc NETworking) involving algorithms/protocols/policies for highly efficient routing, rapid self-configuration and self organization within and across heterogeneous radio sub-nets (platform speeds up to high supersonic); (v) Robust, highly agile, networked UAVs C3 (Communications, Computation and Control) using technologies as autonomic middleware and intelligent agents. The emphasis here is on real-time collaboration between control data plane on distributed C2 platforms to meet UAV flight dynamics and missions, while simultaneously facilitating high data rate ISR (Information, Surveillance Reconnaissance) relay via directional antennas.

<SUBJECT>58 -- RSAF C4I MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>R1472
<CONTACT>Cynthia Lewandowski cindy.lewandowski@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Royal Saudi Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) Modernization Program This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a potential Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement to providing a modernized Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) at locations throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).   The primary operational requirement of the RSAF Commander and his forces is to have the capability to protect the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia against all airborne threats and support maritime and ground force commanders through the effective employment of air assets and execution of air operations. This overarching operational requirement will require the deployment of surveillance, command and control, and communications capabilities to enable the RSAF Commander and his staff to gather, access, and visualize information about the air situation throughout the Kingdom and to plan, order and execute appropriate air operations in defense of the Kingdom using all available air defense/offense resources.  The C4I system is intended to replace the entire functionality of the existing Command & Control (C2) system with modernized, open architecture, open source, state of the art, network-centric architecture that has become the standard throughout military command and control systems.  The modernization will include; replacement of fixed and mobile radar systems as well as an expansion to the existing backbone fiber optic communications infrastructure.   The RSAF requires a modern, standardized C4I system and structure to enable centralized command and decentralized execution of military assets used to defend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  The C4I system will provide the air component picture and a common air and battlefield picture to all RSAF, joint and coalition forces.  The RSAF C4I System is intended to be an AOC network-centric based system.   The RSAF C4I System must be supported and enabled by the state-of-the-art IT infrastructure: up-to-date systems, tools, equipment and methods to enable it to achieve its role in a structured, or distributed, environment.  This support system will be flexible to accommodate future RSAF configuration changes and teaming requirements to maintain maximum force level effectiveness in peace and war time campaigns. The primary components that will comprise the RSAF C4I Modernization effort include the following: Air Operations Center (AOC) The RSAF C4I System is the operational-level war fighting command center for Saudi forces.  It provides centralized planning, direction, control, and coordination of RSAF operations and decentralized execution through its Air Operations Center (AOC). The fundamental principle of this system is centralized planning and control, with decentralized execution by subordinate/tasked organizations and elements, conducted over net-centric infrastructure. Alternate Air Operations Center (AAOC) Identical to the AOC operating in a backup mode Sector Operations Centers (SOC) A scaled down version of the Air Operations Center Base Operations Centers (BOC) Mission specific operations centers to support base specific functions such as logistics and/or training. Facilities Construction for AOC & AAOC All inclusive.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Tomahawk Block IV Torpedo-Tube Launch (TTL) delta costs for material and labor associated with the production of the Block IV TTL missiles.  The Tomahawk Block IV All Up Round (AUR) Full Rate Production (FRP) contract (five year) was awarded on 18 August 2004.  The negotiated FRP contract contains a Variation In Quantity (VIQ) pricing clause for the Surface Ship Capable missile and the Submarine Vertical Launch missile.  The US Navy has a requirement to procure 42 TTL missiles in FY08.  Since a price was already established for the Submarine Vertical Launch missiles, this synopsis is for the delta costs and effort, over and above the currently priced Submarine Vertical Launch missiles, necessary to procure the TTL missiles. NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Block IV Tomahawk Weapons System.  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile and the TTL missile, and is the only source capable of meeting Fleet loadout schedules.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Contemporary information technology projects are often performed by a diverse project team working in a distributed environment. Therefore, maintaining control over key project deliverables is a challenging process.  The software configuration management (SCM) tool needs to be used for the control of tangible project artifacts, such as software artifacts and work products, throughout the project life cycle.  Structured processes in the area now referred to as SCM include controls needed to: •	Verify that project software and documents are physically secure •	Protect the integrity of completed deliverables •	Validate that work in progress is secure and backed up on a regular basis •	Control updates made to completed deliverables •	Establish that the appropriate version of a deliverable is used •	Control the release and issuance of updated deliverables •	Support deliverables kept “in step” with each other •	Centralized Build Management •	Extensive Audit Trail Serena PVCS Professional Suite, is a issue, version, and build management suite, capable of performing sophisticated process and version management for team development. PVCS Professional Suite contains three components: PVCS Version Manager™, TeamTrack, and Builder. With close integration between PVCS Version Manager’s version control capabilities, TeamTrack’s issue and defect tracking, and ChangeMan Builder’s build management functions, PVCS Professional automates processes for the entire application development team.

<DESC>Sources Sought


This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. Qualified sources are limited to 8(a), Hubzone, and small businesses including service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and women owned small businesses. Those parties that have an interest and ability to provide FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) with the services detailed below should SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS. The capability statement and supporting data that clearly illustrate/exhibit the contractor's ability to perform the specified requirement, such as previous similar services performed or resumes, must be submitted no later than February 7, 2007. An electronic copy and four hard copies of the capability statement and each supporting document shall be sent to the contact listed in this announcement. This IS NOT a request for proposals. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from prospective contractors to assist FDA in the ongoing research, development, and implementation of CDRH's Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun).  

Project Description:     

MedSun is a CDRH adverse event reporting/feedback pilot program that has been funded since 2002 under a Task Order contract.  That contract expires in August 2007.  The MedSun program currently includes 350 hospitals and nursing homes which report on-line to CDRH about problems with the use of medical devices.  The program involves investigation of those problems, creating solutions to those issues, and providing feedback to the clinical community about the problems and the solutions.  Educational tools are developed to teach clinicians how to recognize device problems, how to write quality reports about those problems, and how to improve the safe and effective use of devices.  This development is a creative, ongoing process.  The program requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge.  The technical capabilities include: understanding and experience with sociological research, understanding and experience of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases and national health care organizations, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, sound judgment about data quality and usefulness, and development of outcome measures. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to understand the use of medical devices in the clinical community, the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences, and a staff of nurses, physicians, and engineers highly knowledgeable of the use of medical devices in all areas of hospitals. In addition to these technical capabilities, a detailed understanding of federal and state policies related to collection of health care data and medical device adverse events is critical, as well as a detailed understanding of the medical device related statutes of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the associated medical device regulations. 

Because the MedSun program is an ongoing program, there can be no time lag in transitioning the current program from the current contractor to a new contractor.  Therefore, a prospective candidate must have the in-house capability to be able to assume the full project and provide seamless workflow from the beginning of the new Task Order contract.

Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity to perform all the following required capabilities, as well as those cited in the Project Description paragraph, above:

Experience in recruiting a representative sample of acute-care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts. If your firm lacks prior experience with this task, describe specific steps that you would take to to recruit and retain acute care hospitals for participation in long-term research efforts.

Experience in training hospital staff in use of electronic reporting system to report device-related events and providing technical support to more than 1000 system users.

Experience in maintaining on-going cooperation from health-care provider organizations in a national, large-scale patient safety reporting effort.

Demonstrated ability to maintain high level of data security handling sensitive data collected from health provider organizations; credibility with hospital community regarding collection and handling of organizationally sensitive data.

Capability to provide programming and systems support to FDA in maintaining and performing enhancements on secure on-line patient safety reporting system.

Demonstrated ability to obtain project participation of nationally-known patient safety experts in an advisory capacity.

Demonstrated ability to produce useful multi-media educational tools designed to teach clinicians to recognize and report problems with medical devices.

Project management staff with knowledge of medical technology and experience in managing a clinically trained staff.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with clinical training and hospital-based experience in biomedical engineering and nursing in device-intensive settings with experience in root-cause analysis.

On-board staff, or plans to bring staff on board, with experience in developing device problem codes, and in coding adverse event reports with patient and device problem codes.

Experience in conducting web-based rapid response organizational surveys.

Experience in subcontracting to major medical institutions to conduct research.

Experience in planning, organizing and conducting conferences for 300 to 400 hospital-based staff involved with device safety (such as risk managers and biomedical engineers).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT(S) OF CONTACT:       Contracting: J.D. Martin, NSWC Crane, Code 0564, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-3723.       Technical: Ken Burt, NSWC CRANE, Code 609, email LogR&D@navy.mil , 812-854-2139. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President’s hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the President’!  s initiative by being a ”first adopter” of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE, Hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD’s knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program –  1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD’s largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America’s forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel…DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC’s 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified select DOD target site locations with electric-powered forklifts to host pilot programs for this BAA. Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in !  form, fit, and function and equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel met:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.   1.2.1.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts. The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.1.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.2.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered MHE in daily warehousing operations by in-place government personnel.   1.2.3.	This BAA initially solicits proposals for the first phase of this effort, a turnkey operation providing, and maintaining for two years, at least twenty H2-powered forklifts, including hydrogen consumed and the associated hydrogen support infrastructure, at the Defense Depot Susquehanna, PA (DDSP), located in New Cumberland, PA.  It is expected that DDSP personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the forklifts, including fueling them from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser located within the warehouse facility.  Proposals must address how the MHE will be provided, either by retrofit of existing equipment with H2 fuel cells that are form, fit and function replacements for sealed lead-acid batteries or by replacement with MHE specifically designed to be H2 powered, and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed to the MHE.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects o!  f the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for both MHE operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to MHE and infrastructure equipment.   1.2.4.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered MHE will be retrofitted or supplied.   1.2.4.1.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is an additional topic of interest and encouraged in these later phases.   1.2.4.2.	Subsequent phases are expected to be at defense depots located in Tracy, CA, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Albany, GA, and Anniston AL.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below.   1.2.5.	Business case data will be collected by Government personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   2.	Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for DDSP will be first and are due no later than 12/13/2006.  Additional locations will be identified as they become appropriate and will be announced by amendment to this BAA identifying the specific location.  Proposals for these additional locations will be due roughly 30 days from the date of each such BAA amendment with precise dates being set at the time the amendment is issued. Proposal selections are planned to be made over the subsequent 12 months at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for DDSP if they are only interested in other locations/sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technology development, a separate proposal and selection will be conducted for each subsequent location.  Any and all awards are subject to availability of funding.   3.	There will be a pre-proposal conference and site visit for potential offerors on the below date. This pre-proposal conference and site visit will explain and clarify the objectives of this program and allow prospective offerors to view the DDSP site.  Government personnel will also respond to questions, but the information contained within this BAA or amendments to it take precedence over verbal responses.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources. EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President's hydrogen initiative. DOD can contribute to the President'!  s initiative by being a "first adopter" of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily. The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD's knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program -  1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD's largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America's forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel.DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC's 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified some of these electric-powered forklifts as targets of this pilot program.  Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in form, fit, and function an!  d equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.   1.2.	Goal Objectivesal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.  This BAA will be amended as additional DOD site locations are selected to host a pilot program.  Site-specific information and requirements applicable to each new BAA amendment (Proposal Due Date, Site Visit Date, Site Location and Points of Contact, Operating Equipment Targeted for the Pilot Program, Equipment Duty Cycles, Host Site Procedures/Regulations/Utilities/Infrastructures, etc.) are provided at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm for the latest BAA amendment.  For informational purposes the initial BAA and previous BAA amendments are also posted at the link above. 1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.  1.2.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or H2 infrastructure technology. The contractor should describe in detail how this project will advance the TRL and MRL of fuel cell system or hydrogen fueling station and infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts.  The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.3.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered equipment and hydrogen infrastructure during daily operations by in-place government personnel.  The data collected should include sufficient detail to enable the following determinations: •	Fuel cell system continuous and peak power capabilities through pilot. •	Operational efficiency of the pilot systems (fuel cells) under various loading conditions and their degradation through the period of performance.  •	Overall lifecycle efficiency (well-to-tank) of pilot program hydrogen production, compression, and dispensing. •	Mean time between failure and specific pilot program equipment/infrastructure failure modes.  Downtime associated with failure mode. •	Safety incidents encountered through the pilot program and cause of incidents. •	Number hydrogen filling operations throughout the pilot.  •	Refueling rate (kg/min) and average fill time (sec) •	Purity of hydrogen generater/consumed throughout pilot program including specific description of impurities (type and concentrations). •	Total KWH energy produced by the pilot system •	Total KWH energy consumed by the pilot system •	Pilot fuel cell run time Business case data will be collected by contractor personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be provided to the procuring contract officer and the technical point of contact. This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.  1.2.4.	This BAA solicits proposals for the site specific pilot program identified at the link provided in the Background section of this BAA.  It is expected that pilot program host site personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the MHE and contractor-provided equipment, including fueling from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser.  Proposals must address how the equipment will be provided and maintained and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects of the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for equipment operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to proposal and infrastructure equipment. 1.2.5.	Planning, scheduling and delivery.  The contactor shall provide a detailed plan that includes pilot program equipment specifications and a delivery and operation schedule.  The contractor is responsible for all aspects of the pilot program infrastructure installation and operation including, but not limited to, site preparation, construction, permitting, commissioning and decommissioning (at end of project).  The contractor’s detailed schedule shall address all aspects of the pilot program.  The contractor shall clearly define the variable costs of hydrogen production in whichever form it is proposed.  The contractor shall identify any and all utilities and the daily and peak utility usage that the Pilot host will need to provide. 1.2.6.	Training. Proposals shall include a plan to provide operator training for the pilot program (equipment operation and refueling), emergency response training of the operators and local firefighting personnel as related to proposed equipment and support infrastructure. 1.2.7.	Operation and Maintenance. The proposal shall describe the maintenance and repair strategy for the pilot program throughout the full project period.  The proposal shall also include a description of any operational responsibilities of the site host.   1.2.8.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered equipment and/or hydrogen infrastructure will be retrofitted or supplied. 1.2.9.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is a topic of interest and may be encouraged at specific sites.  DLA’s interest in on-site hydrogen generation will be addressed at a link provided in the Background section of this BAA.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below. 2.	 Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for specified sites will be due approximately 30 to 45 days after the issuance of a BAA Amendment identifying the specified site is posted. Specific dates will be identified in the link provided in the Background section of this BAA. Proposal selections are planned to be made during the period this BAA remains open at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for previous sites to be considered for later sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technNSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources. EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President's hydrogen initiative. DOD can contribute to the President'!  s initiative by being a "first adopter" of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily. The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD's knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program -  1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD's largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America's forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel.DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC's 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified some of these electric-powered forklifts as targets of this pilot program.  Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in form, fit, and function an!  d equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.   1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.   1.2.1.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts. The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.1.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.2.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered MHE in daily warehousing operations by in-place government personnel.   1.2.3.	This BAA initially solicits proposals for the first phase of this effort, a turnkey operation providing, and maintaining for two years, at least twenty H2-powered forklifts, including hydrogen consumed and the associated hydrogen support infrastructure, at the Defense Depot Susquehanna, PA (DDSP), located in New Cumberland, PA.  It is expected that DDSP personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the forklifts, including fueling them from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser located within the warehouse facility.  Proposals must address how the MHE will be provided, either by retrofit of existing equipment with H2 fuel cells that are form, fit and function replacements for sealed lead-acid batteries or by replacement with MHE specifically designed to be H2 powered, and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed to the MHE.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects o!  f the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for both MHE operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to MHE and infrastructure equipment.   1.2.4.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered MHE will be retrofitted or supplied.   1.2.4.1.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is an additional topic of interest and encouraged in these later phases.   1.2.4.2.	Subsequent phases are expected to be at defense depots located in Tracy, CA, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Albany, GA, and Anniston AL.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below.   1.2.5.	Business case data will be collected by Government personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   2.	Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for DDSP will be first and are due no later than 12/13/2006.  Additional locations will be identified as they become appropriate and will be announced by amendment to this BAA identifying the specific location.  Proposals for these additional locations will be due roughly 30 days from the date of each such BAA amendment with precise dates being set at the time the amendment is issued. Proposal selections are planned to be made over the subsequent 12 months at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for DDSP if they are only interested in other locations/sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technology development, a separate proposal and selection will be conducted for each subsequent location.  Any and all awards are subject to availability of funding.   3.	There will be a pre-proposal conference and site visit for potential offerors on the below date. This pre-proposal conference and site visit will explain and clarify the objectives of this program and allow prospective offerors to view the DDSP site.  Government personnel will also respond to questions, but the information contained within this BAA or amendments to it take precedence over verbal responses.  Any questions or clarifications that result in material changes to this BAA will be addressed by a written amendment to the BAA. 		Date:    November 21, 2006 (08:00 - 11:00) 		Where: Defense Distribution Depot - Susquehanna, PA (DDSP) 			New Cumberland, PA 17070 		Time:   8:00 A.M. - 11:00 A.M. 		Point of Contact: Lisa Watts (LMI)   (703) 917-7126   lwatts@lmi.org Interested firms are encouraged to attend.  If you plan to attend the pre-proposal conference, you must send an email to the point of contact with the below information NLT 1200 17 November 2006: 		a) Name of Firm 		b) Name(s) and Title of Representative(s) who will attend  (individual information needs to include SSN, Place of birth/citizenship) 		c) Address of Firm 		d) Phone number(s), fax number, and e-mail address(es)  Only those individuals registering will be allowed access to the facility.

The Government will not be liable for expenses incurred by an offeror prior to contract award. Offerors are cautioned that remarks and explanations provided at the conference shall not change the terms of this BAA unless the change(s) is amended in writing.    This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until one year from its initial publication.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $750,000 and $1,500,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and cannot be considered for funding.  Additionally, studies and theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation are specifically excluded.  All criteria set forth in FAR Part 35.016 are applicable. Proposals should be submitted in two sections: full technical and cost. Technical and cost sections should be submitted as separate files.  Each proposal is limited to 35 pages, including attachments and supplementary material.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: a.	Overall relevance and scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort, including the plan and schedule for implementing the pilot programs, completeness of the data collection and comparison, and expected improvements in H2 fuel cell capability at the pilot program's completion; b.	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights;  c.	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortia with H2 implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives;  d.	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-07-R-6685 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>This is a market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify firms with expertise in providing systems to manage the storage and tracking of biological specimens.  Industry responses will aid in the understanding and development of the Government?s functional and technical requirements by identifying capabilities and functionality of commercially available systems. The National Institutes of Health must now track and report on all identifiable human tissue samples stored within the intramural program.  The Government?s object is to identify sources capable of providing both the ability to physically track specimens stored in a variety of conditions as well as manage the related patient data, sample data and usage data in an integrated enterprise-level system.  The National Institutes of Health has developed the following draft Scope of Work:  The Government has a need to acquire a biospecimen storage inventory system capable of providing laboratory workflow management, storage of specimen assay results, integrated patient, clinical and biospecimen data, and integrated electronic documents or questionnaires.  (1) The business model should include the ability to provide a complete turn-key on-site implementation and project management support, complete hardware with multiple environments (build/test, train, production, fail-over) including system servers, hand held systems with bar-code/RFID capabilities and label printing devices and additional peripherals, system configuration and build services, testing, training, implementation services, maintenance, and upgrade services.  (2) Implementation services should provide the ability to work through laboratory work-flow to ensure an appropriate system build, the ability to migrate existing physical management or data management files as well as provide large data extractions.  Vendor should provide consumables such as bar-code labels or RFID chips.  (3) The system proposed should be able to maintain a robust system of records including patient/subject data such unique identifiers, age, race, gender, vital statistics and protocol numbers.  Sample data fields should include protocol or study ID, sample ID, date and time sample collected, collection site, thaw and access tracking, consent form (as PDF or electronic), and related investigator information.  (4) Specimen data should include ID,  type of tracking device (bar-code or RFID device), storage location and environment, type of storage container, volume, specimen warnings, specimen status ? e.g. in storage, in use and the ability to fill in data fields for specimen aliquots as appropriate.  The system should be able to track any associated specimen documentation such as material transfer agreements or cooperative research agreements.   Data about specific boxes, shelves and freezers should be available for reporting and for the placement of new samples.  (5) The physical management of samples should utilize all current applicable technologies and should provide an intuitive user interface.   The system should allow for the addition of new samples with the ability to associate the sample with a patient or study.  Technical capabilities should enable physical sample management for both a wired and wireless environment as well as for storage conditions as low as -200 degrees centigrade.   The system should monitor and track freezer temperatures and freezer failures.  (6) The system must be compatible with both PC and MAC operating environments, scalable to multiple labs as well as multiple disparate geographic locations, allow for customized software, ability to provide decision support, with reporting and query capabilities and tools.  (7) The system should have a role based security schema with the ability to grant varying privileges to multiple user categories, and provide a framework that supports HIPAA and privacy standards.  The system should support import or export of data sets, interface with existing sample management systems as well as appropriate security to prevent the export or download of patient data to local environments.  The system should provide programmatic messaging interfaces such as api or plsql routines.   The system should comply with current interface standards such as HL7 and CDISC.  Data standards should be compliant with LOINC, SNOMED etc.  The system should be able to accommodate 5000 concurrent users, 1000 professional users and 4000 technician level users.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only, and your response is not an offer.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary.  The Government requests that interested parties structure their response expressing their ability to satisfy the Government?s anticipated requirements in the same order as the numbered scope elements above.  The Government will not pay for the information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses.  Solicitations are not available at this time, and as such any requests for solicitations will not receive a response.  Information collected via this market survey will in no way be used to limit or screen potential offerors from future consideration for selection.  Information provided by any offeror in response to this market review shall not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the vendor?s confidential business strategy, and will be protected under FAR 3.104 or FAR Subpart 24.2. All proprietary and restricted information provided in response to this synopsis should be clearly marked.  Interested parties with performance capability should send supporting information that documents that belief.  Responders should provide a high-level description of their current capabilities as well as any other currently available automated solutions that address the needs described in this RFI. Capabilities provided should be as specific as possible, and should identify unique technical qualifications in specific areas. If published pricing is available, please include this information.  In addition, interested parties with commercially available systems are requested to specifically address the following: Describe any known limitations using wireless technology infrastructure and identifying available contingencies in case wireless service is unavailable; describe security features; define capabilities for in-house versus remote hosting; address the timeframe for a typical install from contract issuance to house-wide use.  The information provided need not be excessive in length, but should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that your company understands the nature of work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform.  The NAIC and small business size thresholds for this requirement are respectively, 541512 and 21.0 is the small business size standard.  Responding companies should advise if they are considered a large or small business based upon the size standards provided.  Responses are requested by February 20, 2007.  Please address responses to Julius Y.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
RELOCATION OF T-1 AIRCRAFT SHELTERS 
*****

*****
2.0. REQUIREMENTS 
*****
2.1.  BASIC SPECIFICATION OF SYSTEM: *****   The T-1 shelters presently located on east ramp at hangars 5,6 and 7 with the physical locations being rows 8 through 12 are to be rolled as single units and reattached to existing piers at the south end of the east ramp hangars 15 and 16; rows 16 through 20.  Due to high replacement value of these shelters the contractor shall provide the necessary bond coverage for damage/replacement. In addition to the bonding requirement each shelter move shall be regarded as an independent contract; follow on awards will be based on review of structure integrity, placement accuracy and customer satisfaction.       
*****  
2.2  DESIGN SPECIFICATION: *****  The existing T-1 shelters located at rows 8 through 12 shall be relocated one row at a time by lifting/securing and placing a mobile chassis under each shelter structures and moving them to their predetermined new location at rows 16 through 20.  The shelters shall be moved intact with all lights and subcomponents within or on the shelter; note items such as electrical circuit panels, grounding connections, T-1 CASS systems and CASS (4 inch thick) ground slabs will be disconnected and reinstalled by the base IDIQ electrical contractor.  The moving contractor shall be required to provide drawings of the moving chassis and single point tow bridle (which attaches to the tow vehicle and structure/chassis) to CE for review and approval prior to the move.  There will be no welding, flame cutting or fabrication of components on site.  In the event there is an emergency need for welding a bracket the necessary permits shall be approved and obtained from the Base Fire Marshal and Air Field Manager before any action can be taken.  The moving contractor shall be required to lift the 325 ft long by 55 ft wide structure in one simultaneous slow lift with minimal deflection to the structure and roof.  Once the structure is secured and ready to move the old ground attachment points are to be ground smooth to the ramp (below the service).  The contractor shall provide adequate weight bearing cover matting to cross the DV Red Carpet area in the event the shelters should have to travel over it.  As the structure moves down the ramp, the contractor shall have the necessary personnel and tie down equipment to secure the shelter to the ramp in the event an adverse wind situation should arise.  The structure shall be moved in such a manner that the tow speed should be slow enough to prevent any twisting, waiving, or material deflection of the structure.  Upon the arrival of the shelter at its location, the contractor shall be responsible for aligning the shelter with the existing pier locations, ensuring the alignment with the T-38 shelters at the north end of the east ramp, and reattaching it to the ramp.  The contractor shall use the same grade of original manufacturing materials in securing the shelters attachment points.  When the shelter is secured all critical truss, vertical stanchions, horizontal and knee bracing nuts, bolts and washers shall be replaced and re-torque to original manufactures specifications. The entire structure (including, but not limited to bolts, fasteners, and screws) shall withstand wind gust of 120+ mph.   The contractor shall also be responsible for any and all touch up paint associated with the move; all damaged galvanized surfaces will be treated with an approved material like Galv-o-weld. 	*****

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute - Frederick (NCI-F) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its five (5) year Contract N02-CM-32400 with Taconic Farms, Inc. for the Maintenance of a Rodent Production Center.  The contract currently provides Athymic NCr nu/nu pathogen free rodents for research.  The planned negotiated modification will provide for an extension of the contract for one (1) additional year.  The NCI-Frederick is currently in the process of relocating its primary animal production facilities.  It is expected that the physical relocation of these facilities will negatively impact rodent production, and the extension of this already established contract will aid in offsetting that expected decrease in rodent production.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

The TOPOFF series are congressionally mandated exercises designed to strengthen the nation's capacity to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from large-scale terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. TOPOFF4 is the fourth exercise in this series, and will consist of a simulated terrorist attack.  During the TOPOFF4 exercise, participants will view two feeds of Government furnished information; a live video feed and a website.  The live feed will be similar to a newscast, and will consist of interviews with public officials, medical professionals, and others to increase public understanding of the simulated events that are transpiring, and on actions the public should take to protect themselves. The website, analogous to an online newspaper, will post information and stories about the exercise events and provide information to the public regarding what is transpiring and actions they should take for their protection.  The proposed acquisition, which is contemplated to be for one-year, will be to evaluate the public's understanding, trust in, and compliance with the messaging provided by these two Government furnished information sources throughout the TOPOFF4 exercise, which will last for several days.  In support of this requirement, the Contractor shall complete the following tasks: 1.) Meet with DHS representatives to further refine work requirements within the scope of the contract.  In particular, DHS representatives will provide additional information regarding the types of information they want the Contractor to collect from the study participants (e.g. which type of professional interviewed in the video feed was deemed most trustworthy, what was the participants' understanding as to the protective actions they were to undertake, etc.); 2.) Develop objective, systematic data collection instruments and procedures to collect data on a near real-time basis from study participants.  Data will be collected from the participants at multiple, pre-determined times to evaluate the transmission of information over time; 3.) Recruit study participants from the areas of Portland, Oregon and Guam to participate in the study.  Participants must be representative of various demographic characteristics of the larger populations of interest; 4.) Collect quantitative and qualitative data from the study participants to evaluate such issues as their knowledge of the preparatory, response, and recovery actions available to them to mitigate the impact of a radiological dispersal device; and their understanding, trust in, and compliance with Government and other directives issued via the Government furnished media feeds during TOPOFF4.  Contract deliverables will consist of the following: 1.) Documented Research Plan: Articulates the sampling method, data collection instruments, etc. acceptable to DHS customers and HFD personnel; 2.) Final Report and Evaluation: A detailed written report of the evaluation to include all research findings and their practical implications for persons and organizations tasked with emergency communications.  Also included within this deliverable will be a brief document or checklist containing practical guidance for persons and organizations tasked with communicating with the public during emergency situations; 3.) After Action Report: Describes in clear and concise language the main findings and implications of the evaluation.  Contractor personnel shall possess the requisite skills and technical background necessary to successfully complete the tasks described herein, including, but not limited to the following: Knowledge of research and theory on risk communications; Knowledge of social science research methods (e.g. quantitative and qualitative methods, interviewing, survey design, and focus groups); Experience conducting large scale social science research projects focused on evaluating the effect of risk communications on the public; and experience translating research findings into practical guidance for policy makers, communications experts, and others tasked with communicating to the public during emergencies.  In addition, at least one staff member assigned to this project shall have a Ph.D. in a social science related field.  Interested sources are invited to submit a one-page statement of capability (Microsoft Word) to include company name, address, and point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, and business size (indicating whether you are a large or small business for purposes of the assigned NAICS code), and GSA Contract Number/Federal Supply Schedule identifier, if applicable.  Written responses must be received no later than 2/24/2007, 5:00 PM (EST).  Responses shall be e-mailed to Elizabeth Clark at the contact information designated below.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is establishing the Institute of Regenerative Medicine dedicated to repairing battlefield injuries through the use of regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine is a promising field that  has already achieved early success in the regeneration of several tissues and organs for repair or replacement. Regenerative medicine encompasses many novel approaches for the treatment of damaged tissues and organs by using therapies that prompt the body  to autonomously regenerate, and by using the patients own cells on biodegradable biomaterials for the creation of engineered organs for therapy.  These innovations are possible because of several key advances, including the development of systems that ca n reliably nurture cells as they grow and divide, the discovery of growth factors that foster cell proliferation in vitro, and fabrication of biomaterial scaffolds for tissue generation in three-dimensions. The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) looking for individual or teams of universities and companies that are capable of supporting the mission of the institute.  The response to the RFI should demonstrate experience in areas of tissue regeneration, including but not limited to; vascular, nerve, muscle, bone and cartilage, and digits and limbs.  Responden ts should also demonstrate experience in navigating the regulatory pathway through clinical trials.  In addition, it is envisioned that a team will be operating in a geographically dispersed environment.  Therefore, responses should demonstrate the ability  to manage a dispersed and diverse team of medical and scientific professionals in an outcome driven environment working toward successful initiation and possible completion of clinical trials. It is envisioned that this institute will be an organization consisting of multiple universities and/or companies working in conjunction with the US Army Institute of Surgical Research under the framework of a five-year cooperative agreement.  USAMRMC has $5 million/year budgeted for this project and is seeking collaboration from other government agencies to push the total contract award to a minimum of $10 million/year. The Government is seeking responses from interested parties as a result of this announcement.  The Government is soliciting interested parties only at this time.  No awards will be made from this announcement.  However, all information received may be used  for evaluation of future awards.  Interested universities and companies shall provide a white paper (no more than 25 pages in length) describing their capabilities to meet the above requirement.  Responses to this Request for Interest should be directed t o Christopher Gloyd, Contract Specialist, at the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), at christopher.gloyd@det.amedd.army.mil.  Responses are due by 3:00PM eastern standard time, 2 March, 2007.  No telephone calls please.

The eyewear frames should not move around inside the mask or interfere with wearing the mask in any way. They should be durable and comfortable for the wearer.  Additionally, the frames are required to provide an airtight seal when worn with the EAB mask. The masks are worn to protect the individual from smoke inhalation and therefore, no break in the seal can be permitted due to the eyewear frames. The frames, when worn, should permit easy donning of the EAB mask and fit readily inside the mask.  The frames must permit an airtight seal of the mask against the face of the wearer, using either a flexible metal or plastic temple or a circumferential strap.  The frame assembly must be comfortable when worn.   The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. 4.0	POSSIBLE EYEWEAR SOLUTION The eyewear must meet the functional requirements specified above.  NSMRL is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  NSMRL encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.   This RFI seeks information about prescription eyewear that would be compatible when wearing an EAB mask.  In doing so, NSMRL seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.   5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE  Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by NSMRL.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

Aubonson Science has over 30 years of experience in the investigation of the heterogeneous transfer between gas phase and solid phase interfaces and its impact on the spectroscopic and electrical behavior of the condensed phase.

<SUBJECT>--Modify contract number DAMT01-98-D-1005 to extend the contract for three months with three additional one month options for a total maximum extension of six months for the Defense Travel System (DTS) with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS).
<DESC>1. Contracting Activity:  US Army Contracting Agency, Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC-4), 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331-1700. This notice is being published as required by FAR 5.201 and any bids or proposals received in response to it shall be considered.  See Government-Wide numbered note 22. 2. Background: The Defense Travel System (DTS) is an Acquisition Category 1AM (ACAT 1AM) system that has been procured by the Department of Defense (DoD) for the management of travel within DoD. The system is mission critical and requires adequate sustainm ent of operation to enable official travel within DoD. DTS is now the officially designated system to be used by DoD for commercial temporary duty travel. Over thirty-five financial systems have been adapted to use DTS, and travel business processes of all  services and agencies have been modified to eliminate the historical paper systems used to process travel vouchers and reimburse travelers for out-of-pocket expenses. The Program Management Office - Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS) is the management authority for the program. System Operations and Maintenance, Development, Training, and Help Desk activities are currently carried out under contract number DAMT01-98-D-1005  with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS) in Fair Lakes, VA. This contract expires on 02 April 2007, and PMO-DTS is in the process of competitively awarding a new contract for the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) and Development portions of the current c ontract.  The new competition has been delayed and award of a follow-on contract is not expected until May 2007 at the earliest.  Consequently, the current period of performance does not allow sufficient time for a transition to a new contractor if require d. 3. Proposed Contract Action. The government intends tomodify contract number DAMT01-98-D-1005 (Contract) to extend the contract for three months with three additional one month options for a total maximum extension of six months for the Defense Travel Sy stem (DTS) with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS) to obtain the following requirements: "	Operations & Sustainment of the DTS to include: o	Procure additional system hardware and infrastructure to accommodate the growing user community o	Maintain the GEX interface  "	Development o	Complete Tech Refresh o	Implement Change Proposals (CPs) in support of approved changes o	Provide management required for the above "	Testing o	The testing task includes designing and conducting software tests to verify that the software meets all specified and functional requirements "	Site Fielding Support o	Provide personnel support to aid Government teams in fielding DTS to the remaining DoD Agency sites  "	Commercial Travel Office (CTO) Support o	Validate Passenger Name Records (PNRs) in support of fielding activities to enable CTOs to provide ticketing and other travel services "	Travel Expense Reimbursement o	Provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred by contractor personnel in traveling as needed to carry out contract tasks The Government envisions the following transition activities within the six-month extension period: Transfer of all relevant documents describing the Defense Travel System from the transition contractor to the new contractor, and review by appropriate technical staff. There are 329 hardware configuration items, and 672 software configuration items. 	 Work performed by teams staffed by the transition contractor and the new contractor on O&M and development tasks, with sharing of effort and transfer of knowledge between contractors. This will include assigning system problems to new contractor teams for resolution, with personnel from the transition contractor available for consultation. This is envisioned to enable the identification of areas needing more time or more work, that present particular difficulty in the transition to the new contractor. Pro blem areas will be documented for particular management attention, and, if necessary, appropriate training will be provided to contractor personnel. Hardware transition will begin during this period.	 Trouble-shooting tasks carried out by the new contractor with gradually decreasing oversight by the transition contractor, to ensure that needed knowledge is transferred and capabilities are being developed. As the new contractor personnel gain expertise, and demonstrate their ability to resolve problems and keep the system operating, the transition contractor support level will decline. Hardware transition will be completed during this period, and the system will be turned on and operating in the new envir onment.	 4. Contractor Qualifications: The transition contractor must (1) possess system design expertise and have the ability to trouble-shoot and fix DTS system problems; and (2) be  able to transfer DTS  knowledge and expertise to a new contract awardee upon the  award of a new contract for DTS O&M and development, within a period of six months or less.

All communications concerning this notice must be sent to both POCs: Christos Daoulas, Contracting Officer, christos.daoulas@itec4.army.mil;  Carolyn D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NB847000703868DT.  The proposed procurement is a Total Small Business set aside.  NAICS Code:  334516.  Small Business Size Standard: 500 Employees. 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Ion Storage Group requires a sensitive camera to image the low-light level fluorescence from trapped ions. As the number of ions in this work can be very small (even as small as a single ion), a camera with extreme low light level capabilities (essentially photon counting sensitivity) is required. Because the camera will also be used for laser beam set-up and alignment, it must have a variable gain and be able to withstand occasional strong signals without damage to the camera.  The NIST work requires high resolution (less than 20 micrometer pixels).  These requirements are met by an electron multiplication CCD (EMCCD) camera using an E2V Technologies EMCCD chip. Photon counting sensitivity on essentially no background requires cooling the chip to below -80 degrees C. The laser induced fluorescence we are detecting is in the ultraviolet region (UV) of the spectrum (3 13 nm and 280 nm).  Therefore NIST requires a back illuminated chip with a UV sensitive coating with an overall effective quantum efficiency of 35 % or greater at these wavelengths.  Additional requirements for the camera include:  minimum of 512 x 512 pixels, less than -80 degrees C thermoelectric cooling with forced ambient (@ 20 C) air, UV grade fused silica window with UVAR coating on both sides, integrated mechanical shutter, choice of at least 5 and 10 MHz pixel read out rates with the EMCCD amplifier, minimum of a 1 MHz pixel read out rate with a traditional amplifier, less than 0.005 spurious events/pixel/frame with the 10 MHz EMCCD read out rate, software for controlling the camera with a PC.

The required delivery is within 70 calendar days after receipt of order and shall be made F.O. B. Destination to NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305.  Award will be made based on price (provided that the quoted equipment meets the requirements of this RFQ). Documentation that the camera meets the above specifications must be supplied and will be used only to determine product compliance with the Government's requirements. This can be done through a company data sheet or specification sheet.
Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by e-mail.  You may submit your quote by e-mail, fax, or by mail.  Quotes must be received on or before close of business January 19, 2007. Notwithstanding responses received--it is at the discretion of the government to add additional sources and/or consider other quotes received after close of due date if it is in the best interest of the Government.  Please include delivery schedule, business size, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items--Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

DESCRIPTION:

The overall project objective is to fund an on-the-water vessel and operator to assist the Council in the protection and restoration of natural resources.  Assistance shall include identifying activities or conditions that may adversely affect the success of restoration projects.  Additionally, this monitoring will support other activities and educational projects associated with the harbor cleanup and restoration.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:

Task 1:  Conduct New Bedford Harbor Inspections.
The contractor shall be on the water in the New Bedford Harbor (Inner and Outer Harbors) for 180 hours over the course of each one (1) year period of performance to investigate, document, report on and act as a deterrent to, environmentally harmful activities in the Harbor.  These activities include, but are not limited to, illegal dredging, filling, shell fishing, industrial or commercial discharges to the harbor, vessel pump-outs, dumping, and spills and other activities harmful to the Harbor Environment.  The contractor shall also monitor regulated activities in the harbor, including dredging operations.

During these inspections, if the contractor notes any damage or harmful or potentially harmful activities affecting the Harbor, including activities inconsistent with permit and/or regulatory conditions, the contractor shall immediately contact the appropriate authorities and the NMFS POC.  (Soon after contract award the POC and contractor shall discuss likely harmful activities that may be noted during the inspections and the appropriate authorities the contractor shall contact in each situation.)  This Scope of Work does not authorize the contractor to engage in law enforcement activities (e.g. using force to eliminate a problematic activity).  Additionally, during the course of inspections, the contractor shall distribute to the general boating public the education and outreach material developed under Task 4 of this scope of work.

The contractor shall maintain a log detailing the timing and results of each inspection (even if no problems are discovered) and shall take and maintain a log detailing the timing and results of each inspection (even if no problems are discovered) and shall take and maintain a photographic record documenting any issues noted during the inspections.  Digital video footage to supplement the photographic record is encouraged.  These logs and supporting photographs and video shall be included in the quarterly status reports (see Deliverables).

The contractor shall submit a proposed inspection schedule, after Notice to Proceed is given, but prior to the beginning of performance, (totaling 180 hours of on-the-water inspections) for approval by the POC based on the following guidelines:
a)	The contractor shall very the days and times of the Harbor inspections to avoid establishing a predictable schedule.
b)	The contractor shall perform at least 30% of such inspections between the hours of 10:00 PM and 5:00 AM.
c)	The contractor shall conduct at least one inspection event per month during the course of the contract year, if weather and ice conditions allow.

This task also includes following up on any issues noted during the inspections, and working with the harbor businesses and harbor users to inform them of pollution and habitat degradation issues and assist with the development of appropriate solutions.  The contractor shall attend five (5) two-hour follow-up meetings in the New Bedford Harbor communities over the course of the contract year.  Schedule shall identify representative attending the follow-up meetings.

Task 2:  Conduct Tern Islands Trash Removal.
Three islands in Buzzards Bay (Ram Island, Bird Island, and Penikese Island) serve as important breeding grounds for Common and Roseate terns.  The New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council is funding efforts to enhance the breeding success of terns at these three islands.  Trash accumulates on the shores of these islands and may be harmful to the terns.

The contractor, under the supervision of staff from the Massachusetts Division of Fish and Wildlife (MDFW), shall collect and remove the accumulated trash from the shoreline and/or other inland areas of each island as directed by MDFW.  Such activities shall take place in early-to mid-May of the current period of performance as approved by the POC.  All trash removed from the islands must be properly disposed of on the mainland in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

The contractor shall photo document the accumulated trash on each island and the shoreline cleanup efforts.  This photo documentation, along with a brief narrative describing the completed shoreline cleanup efforts, the type and volume of material removed, and method of disposal of the refuse shall be included in the quarterly report submitted to the POC that covers the time period in which the cleanups take place.


Task 3:  Trustee Transportation.
At the discretion of the Government, the contractor shall make the funded vessel and crew available to the Trustees or their agents, if requested, for efforts related to Trustee-funded restoration projects.  These vessel uses may include providing staff and/or equipment transportation to proposed or implemented restoration sites, and serving as a work base for monitoring activities.  The contractor shall assume that three (3) boat days per period of performance will be required by the Trustees and/or their agents.  The request for such use of the vessel and crew shall only be requested and authorized by the POC a minimum of ten (10) calendar days prior to the need for such transportation.

Task 4:  Prepare and Distribute Outreach and Education Brochure
The contractor shall develop an outreach and education brochure to inform boaters and other parties in and around New Bedford Harbor about the location and availability of pump-out services and the usefulness and availability of bilge socks; encourage environmentally responsible boating, and contain other information pertinent to protecting the quality of the New Bedford Harbor Environment.  This brochure shall also include a description of the work of the New Bedford Trustee Council and others to restore the injured resources of the Harbor Environment.

The contractor shall obtain POC concurrence with the draft brochure prior to finalizing and distributing them to boaters and marinas in the area.  The contractor shall develop, print and distribute by hand during the summer boating season three hundred (300) copies of the brochure.  Note that this task will only occur the first contract year and not in any subsequent years.

Deliverables

The contractor shall provide the following deliverables:

Schedule of Harbor Site Inspections.
The contractor shall provide the POC with a proposed schedule of New Bedford Harbor Inspections, including the proposed dates and times of each proposed inspection, and a rationale for such a schedule, for the POC?s approval prior to beginning the site inspections.

Status Reports.
The vessel and its operator will essentially be part of the ?eyes and ears? of the Council regarding the status of restoration projects and general environmental health in and around the New Bedford Harbor area.  (See Attachment 1: Vessel/Operator Selection Criteria).  The vessel operator shall, therefore, furnish the POC with a quarterly status report of the recent activities of the vessel (as identified in the Tasks described herein.).  Each quarterly report shall include digital photographs (provided on CD-ROM) and video footage of any issues noted during the inspections (with appropriate labels of date, time taken, photo location and description) and of any other noteworthy activities monitored.  One hard copy of the report and one CD-ROM with an electronic copy of the report and supporting photos/video shall be submitted to the POC quarterly.

The first quarterly report is due to the POC within 110 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed.  However, should the contractor find significant adverse impacts affecting New Bedford Harbor, he/she shall immediately contact the appropriate local, state, and federal authorities, and then notify the POC.  Examples of adverse impacts include oil spills, vessel groundings, boat waste discharge, vandalism, illegal access to restoration projects, illegal dredging, illegal filling, illegal shell fishing, illegal or non-permitted discharges to the harbor, and other types of environmental disturbances potentially affecting the New Bedford Harbor Environment.

Invoices
The contractor shall submit invoices monthly.  Invoices shall be sent to the POC to be reconciled by the 15th of each month.  Invoices shall detail the percentage of work completed by Task.  Invoices shall be sent to the POC.  

Educational/Informational Brochure
The contractor shall prepare, print and distribute an outreach brochure to the boating public during the summer season containing the information described in the Tasks described herein.  The contractor shall print and distribute by hand, both on the water and around docks and marinas, 300 copies of this brochure.  Note that this deliverable is due in the first contract year and not in any subsequent years.

Water Transportation.
The contractor shall set aside a maximum of three (3) days of the boat?s use and crew?s time, per contract year, for the transport of the Council and/or their agents to restoration and monitoring sites as described in the tasks stated herein. 

Optional Periods of Performance.
At the discretion of the Government up to two (2) one-year option periods of performance may be exercised.  The exercise of any option shall be based on the performance of the contractor and the degree to which the contractor?s actions advance the Council?s mission of protecting, restoring, replacing natural resources that have been harmed by the PCB contamination, and execution of the tasks as described herein.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334515 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a High Current, High Power DC Current Source to be used in the Atomics Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  

Line Item 0001:  The Contractor shall furnish one (1) Each, High Current, High Power DC Current Source

NIST requires a high current, high power DC current source to drive a resistive magnetic (the inductive load is about 2 mH) in an atom trapping experiment.  

The Contractor shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1. Output current: minimum 400 A.
2. Output voltage: minimum 60 V.
3. Current setting 2 mA out of 400 A.
4. Long term stability: 2 mA.
5. Computer control via RS232 or GPIB.  Specifications 3, 4 and 5 are related.  Must be able to command a current from the computer to 5 ppm and expect that output.  Traditional analog inputs or 16 bit DACs are not sufficient.
6. Electronically quiet from DC to at least 20 MHz.
7. Timing: It is intended to drive current ramps which need to be programmed from an external computer and then synchronized with the remainder of the experiment.

This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number W911S8-07-T-0008 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotations.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15 and DCN 20070122.

In the event both the Logistics Center Gate and the D Street Gate are closed, comm ercial vehicles must use the Madigan Gate (Exit 122 from I-5). Madigan Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday.   All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as so on as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.   On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped  searched - label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.   Searched - labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North  Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a  searched - label.  The Contractor shall ensure th at its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installa tion through any fast access gate lane without being routinely subjected to a vehicle inspection, except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics C enter gate or the D Street Gate.  If both of those gates are closed then the commercial vehicles will use the Madigan Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate, D Street Gate, or the Madigan Gate, as appropriate per the hours in (a) above and obtain visitor passes.     Fast Access gate lanes are available at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the Ea st Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, and the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate.  Fast Access lanes are planned for the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those  lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.

(End of clause)  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:   a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast ac cess identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees , at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Installation Visitor Center located near the Main (Liberty) Gate.  Contractors opera ting a commercial vehicle may obtain a 1-day pass at either the Logistics Center Gate or the D Street Gate when those gates are operational.  When the Logistics Center Gate and the D Street Gate are closed, commercial vehicles will use the Madigan Gate.  T he visitors pass may be issued for a maximum of up to 30 days at a time based on sponsorship.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fas t Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees wh o are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identificati on badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, t he contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not  to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.    c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badg e to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed  up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this cont ract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report t he loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calenda r day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garm ent unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termi nation of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been acc ounted for.   g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for a ccess to the installation.  (End of clause)  Local clause 52.111-4133 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.
