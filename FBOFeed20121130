<DESC>The Pine Bluff Arsenal, Pine Bluff, AR intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Orion Registrar Inc., 7850 Vance Dr., Arvada, CO 80003.  This requirement is for a contractor to perform the required audits for re-certification of ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001.  The contractor shall be a Registrar accredited through the ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB).  The period of performance will be for approximately 5 years, as the Orion Registrar Inc. will be responsible for filing the re-certifications and follow up audits as required. Orion Registrar Inc. has provided these services for Pine Bluff Arsenal through full and open competition over the past few years.  It is felt that the Government would not save any monies by obtaining a new contractor as the learning curve would start over and be more time consuming for Pine Bluff Arsenal personnel.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to this requirement by submitting written capabilities to the Contract Specialist identified below.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 3 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 3 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Orion Registrar Inc.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541990/$7 million.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $150,000. There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Pamela J. Burton via email @ pamela.j.burton10.civ@mail.mil.

Base ESMs and revisions to base ESMs will be incorporated only by contract modification.  Revisions to sub-ESMs will require a contract modification.  The contract period of performance will consist of one base year effort with two one-year options (dependent on task to be performed and availability of applicable appropriation).  The total estimated hours of the contract is 804,039. <br>  <br> This is a planned sole source requirement to AAI Corporation (CAGE 97384), the original equipment manufacturer of the Shadow UAS.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <strong>Sterile Disposable OR Towels on or about February 2013</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical requirements, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.<br />&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Examples of items</strong> being solicited could include, but are not limited to, <a name="OLE_LINK4"></a><a name="OLE_LINK3"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK4">Sterile Disposable OR Towels </span></a>to include: sterile, disposable, latex free/safe, prewashed towels, with de-linted or low lint properties, 100% cotton, color fast fabric material that is available with and without radiopaque filament, packaged in quantities of 2, 4, 6 per pack, in size ranges 27-32 inches in length and 12-17 inches in width.

This synopsis precedes the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) entitled, "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)" for construction and design/build services.  The subsequent contracts will be performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs,  Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), Erie, Pennsylvania.    As a result of the solicitation, the Government intends that a minimum of three (3) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts will be awarded providing sufficient qualified contractors present acceptable offers. This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.   Contractors must be verified in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz Database to be eligible to submit a proposal.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/. Contractors must be verified as a SDVOSB to be eligible for award.  Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/  to be eligible for award.  The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million in average annual receipts.   Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are responsive and conforming to the RFP, and are also determined to be most advantageous to the Government in terms of Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Work to be performed under the MATOC contract(s) will include construction and design/build projects.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work.  Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications.  However, offerings may include some design/build projects.  Award of the design/build option may be restricted to companies having demonstrated past performance and technical capability for performing design/build projects. Contractors can qualify for a base contract without submitting a proposal for design/build.  The resulting contracts will not have fixed unit costs.  All contract work will be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects at the Erie, PA VAMC.  Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own wage determination.  These task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees only.  Each of the resulting contracts will include a one (1) year base period and four (4), one (1) year option periods. The minimum and maximum values for a single Task Order are $2,000 and $5 Million, respectively. The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $30 million over the life of the contract. The minimum guaranteed order for each contract is one (1) task order valued at a minimum of $5,000 or if no task order project is awarded a guaranteed fee of $5,000 will be paid to the contractor. The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to compete for, but is not awarded, a task order throughout the life of the contract. If a contractor is not awarded all option years as a result of a contractor failing to submit proposals or as a result of poor past performance on previous task orders, the contractor will not be entitled to the minimum guarantee.   The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation. This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  The anticipated release date for the Solicitation is Jan 07, 2013.  The solicitation will be posted at this website, www.fbo.gov. All inquiries shall be in writing, e-mail inquiries to Paul Bosak at Paul.Bosak@va.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.

PURPOSE:

c. Respondent's access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, etc, if necessary to perform the contract.  If subcontracting, teaming, or partnering arrangements are anticipated, those arrangements must be identified, as well as the estimated percentage of the total effort that each subcontractor, partner, or team member will provide of the total effort.

<CONTACT>Glenn T. Emig, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025028669, Email glenn.emig@ferc.gov
<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is to provide advance information to industry regarding an anticipated solicitation for Information Technology Support Services (ITSS). This is not a solicitation nor does this notice guarantee that a solicitation will be released.</p>
<p>On May 28, 2009 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) awarded on a competitive basis a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract to GDIT for ITSS. The contact includes a base year and four option years. The current total value of the contract (all five years) is $110,826,020. The contract is currently in option year 3 which has a period of performance of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013; the estimated value of option year 3 is $23,067,594. The estimated value for option year 4 is $22,997,645.</p>
<p>The government has determined that it may not be in the best interest of the government to exercise option year 4 of the current contract; consequently, the government is currently drafting the acquisition strategy and requirements documents to compete the ITSS contract for performance beginning on October 1, 2013. The government's desire to recompete the ITSS contract is not a reflection on the incumbent's performance. Rather, the government would like to recompete the contract in order to move to a less risky contract type.</p>
<p>Although the acquisition strategy has not been finalized, the contracting officer is releasing the following information to provide advanced notice to industry and to correct any misunderstandings regarding the government's intentions.</p>
<p>Contract type: The government has not finalized the contract type; however, the contract type will be consistent with FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Contract vehicle: The government intends to compete this requirement. The government is currently considering the following vehicles:<br />&bull; GSA Schedule 70<br />&bull; NITAAC CIO SP3<br />&bull; A standalone contract (less likely)</p>
<p>Period of performance: The government anticipates that the period of performance will include a base year from October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014 plus four (4) one-year options.</p>
<p>Draft solicitation: The government is considering releasing a draft solicitation for industry comment.</p>
<p>Site visit: The government is considering providing a site visit of the FERC facility to interested parties.</p>
<p>Procurement schedule: <br />&bull; Draft solicitation (if a draft is released): January 2013<br />&bull; Release solicitation: February 2013<br />&bull; Site visit (if a site visit is conducted): February 2013<br />&bull; Proposals due: March/April 2013 <br />&bull; Award (if without discussions or revised proposals): May/June 2013<br />&bull; Award ( if discussions/revised proposal are necessary): July/August 2013<br />&bull; Transition to successful offeror (if necessary): August/September 2013<br />&bull; Performance begins: October 1, 2013</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is still in the acquisition planning phase. The contracting officer will provide additional information to industry through this site at the appropriate time. Offerors are cautioned that it is not appropriate to contact anyone at FERC other than the contracting officer regarding this procurement.</p>

The period of performance is for 12 months.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide full coverage on all instruments service parts and labor. In addition, the agreement also include comprehensive email and telephone support, three (3) business days average on-site response time, critical and non-critical updates, applications support, access to on-line training modules and discounts on optional advanced trainings programs. The contractor will provide one preventative maintenance visit per year.</p>
<p>Illumina Inc. is the manufacturer of the above stated instruments and is the sole source provider of service agreements for these machines.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Office of Translational Research, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pearson Pharma Partners, 31194 La Baya Drive; Westlake Village, CA 91362 for the modification to purchase order on existing services for additional hours.</p>
<p>In 2010, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research established a new model for drug development - a network that integrates industry drug development expertise with the innovative disease biology of NIH-funded research. This created the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) at NINDS. The BPN launched multiple projects in 2011 with senior-level, industry-experienced drug development consultants who help to develop promising new drug compounds at the NIH. The consulting individuals or companies that were awarded Purchase Orders are required to design and direct the drug development plan on BPN projects with NIH Principal Investigators. In addition, work requirements included the possibility of providing guidance on other NIH neuroscience-focused drug development programs.</p>
<p>Pearson Pharma Partners is a drug development consulting company that was issued a Purchase Order to provide expert guidance on NIH Blueprint projects involved in the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) field. Pearson Pharma Partners was awarded a Purchase Order on June 20, 2011 for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year optional periods (PO#HHSN271201100386P). Due to the increase of the projects in the BPN and other NIH programs that require guidance from the consultant on ADME issues, there is a need for an increase in services.</p>
<p>These additional hours include profiling ADME issues on all BPN-funded projects and continuing to serve as co-chairperson on a Lead Development Team (LDT). An additional 200 hours will be required in the current performance period for the additional amount of consulting services needed. An additional 100 hours will be added to the remaining three (3) one-year optional periods in the current Purchase Order, including the option to exercise four (4) additional 50-hour optional quantities per future period of performance.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This</p>
<p>Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing this synopsis number, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Hunter A. Tjugum, at tjugumha@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete requirements previously performed under NIA Contract No. HHSN260200700026C. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures using NAICS Code 541990 and FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a one (1) year base period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2013, with three (3) one year options. It is expected that a solicitation will be issued on or about December 21, 2012. The objective of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) Home Visits Program is limited to ongoing retention, re-contact and scheduling activities, and the conduct of BLSA home visits using the protocol and methodology developed and implemented over the last five years.
<p>The BLSA constitutes a continuous enrollment cohort where participants can join at any age after 20 years and are followed for life. Eligibility at time of enrollment is restricted to persons free of cognitive and functional limitations, chronic conditions and diseases and active cancer within the past 10 years. Participants receive regularly scheduled comprehensive health, cognitive and functional evaluations over a two to three day visit to the NIA IRP Clinical Unit at Harbor Hospital. Presently, visits occur every four years for persons under age 60, biannually for persons aged 60 to 79 years and annually for persons aged 80 and older. Extensive state-of-the-art evaluations are conducted to characterize the main aging phenotypes and sub-clinical and clinical diseases and include multiple measures of physical and cognitive function. These measures constitute a more comprehensive and robust assessment of health and physiologic status than any other epidemiologic study of aging. <br />The primary objectives of this procurement are to: 1) maintain a complete and accurate database of participant contact information and visit and vital status, 2) retain, re-contact and schedule BLSA participants for their regular follow-up clinic visits, 3) conduct follow-up evaluations of BLSA participants who cannot come to Baltimore for their usual assessment using a home visit or telephone interview for those unavailable for a home visit, 4) provide critically important data on catastrophic health events, disability, cognitive impairment, dementia, frailty and other near end of life parameters, 5) improve coverage of study endpoints (e.g., frailty, disability and dementia) and accuracy of decline trajectory estimates by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring," 6) expand collection of biological samples to participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability; that is, are unable to attend a clinic visit.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: (1) Project plan - This plan shall include: a) projected home and telephone only visits by contract year including participant location (local, regional or long distance), b) the manual of operations for the BLSA participant database, c) updated and revised home visit manual of operations, d) draft monthly progress report form and template and e) outline of issues requiring further discussion. (2) Monthly Progress report - This report minimally shall include the following: a) identifying information (i.e., contract number and title, period of performance being reported, Contractor's name and address, report author and submission date), b) the identification and visit numbers of participants contacted for a home visit and the outcome of that contact (e.g., scheduled, deceased, telephone only scheduled, refused), c) identification and visit number for each participant who received a home visit or telephone visit during the reporting period and visit type, whether an informant CDR was performed, autopsy program status (i.e., new enrollee, past enrollee, not interested), status of blood draw and status of EKG assessment and d) indication of any new or ongoing issues encountered that may impede progress and proposed corrective action. (3) Final report - A final report shall be submitted on or before the expiration date of contract. This report shall include a summation of all work performed under the contract and a compilation of the monthly progress report data on home and telephone visits completed. This report shall be in sufficient detail to describe comprehensively the numbers and types of evaluations performed.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.<br /><br />This requirement was previously publicized under sources sought notice nos. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-12-169 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-12-169.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source cost-type Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-10-G-0004 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) on continued risk reduction of the E-2D Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) integration solution in support of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) Program. A portion of these tasks are to be listed as options to be priced and negotiated during the proposal process for future execution, as funding becomes available. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-base precision approach and landing systems. It is comprised of ship/land systems, aircraft systems and JPALS-specific data link using existing GPS satellites. The JPALS supports joint service (sea and land), civil and multi-national interoperability. The purpose of this procurement is to build on previous NGSC efforts in FY09 and FY10, continuing to define the necessary technical support and required modifications to existing E-2D avionics and providing technical support to reduce risk and refine the technical data necessary for the E-2D JPALS integration effort, currently planned to begin in FY16. NGSC is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator, and manufacturer of the E-2D AHE aircraft and weapon system and, as such, is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and data necessary to provide the required supplies and services. In addition, NGSC is the sole Contractor with the data necessary to successfully perform the tasks required to deliver the supplies and services needed to sustain and modify E-2D AHE aircraft and components. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation document exists. See Note 22.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production for the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.

If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Research and Diagnostic Systems Inc., located in Minneapolis, MN for 10 Cytokine Detection Kits with the option to purchase 20 additional kits.  The Cytokine Detection Kits will be used to detect rhesus monkey cytokines. <br />This supply will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training, equipment, and supplies required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.  <br />Although many companies make Human Cytokine Detection Kits R&amp;D Systems Inc. seems to be the only one that will work to detect rhesus monkey cytokines. Only one company makes a monkey kit and it only detects cynomolgus monkey cytokines and will not work for this experiment. Due to the fact that they are using Human kits on monkeys the variables will be different. Hence, experiments were conducted with seven different brands of Cytokine Detection Kits over the course of six months and only R&amp;D Systems Inc. kits cross reacted with rhesus samples. No other human kit form any other company could detect rhesus monkey cytokines.  This is due to the fact that R&amp;D Systems Inc. uses specific antibody clone which is their proprietary property. Therefore, the R&amp;D Systems Inc. is the only know source that can provided the requested Cytokine Detection Kit.<br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (stephen.enokida@usuhs.edu) by 1:00 p.m. EST on December 12, 2012.    <br />

<DESC>This RFI is issued to gather information regarding market capabilities for engineering, professional and administrative support services, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 37.2, across all geographic locations of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC); see Attachment 1. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy and performance work statement. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.
<p>AFLCMC, AFRL and NWC operating locations are currently acquiring Advisory Support and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) by using multiple contracts issued by individual local base contracting offices, contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts. AFLCMC intends to implement strategic purchasing plans for its future EPASS. Our goal is to leverage resources across AFLCMC, define common specifications and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments. AFLCMC seeks to minimize impacts to the end user/customer and is seeking information from both small and large business sources as part of market research to build an understanding of the market dynamics with regard to A&amp;AS support. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this future acquisition is NAICS 541712 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) with a size standard of 1,500 employee.</p>
<p>Preliminary considerations focus on a broad spectrum of labor categories. These may include but are not limited to: program managers, management analysts, subject matter experts, consultants, program integrators, engineers (e.g., electrical, industrial, chemical/material, aerospace, mechanical, geospatial, test and software, etc.), quality assurance, configuration management, systems analyst, logistician, electronic and mechanical technicians, computer scientist, database architect, enterprise architect, and support in the areas of division planning, programming, operations, security manager, information assurance, clerical, technical skills.</p>
<p>The Government is considering contracting strategies, to include a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) A&amp;AS contract(s). The base contract period of performance is anticipated to be five years, with no option periods, and the ceiling is estimated to be between $3,000,000,000.00 - $5,000,000,000.00. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."</p>
<p>If you are an interested small or large business, please complete the questionnaire, Attachment 2, and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information. Notice: E-mail responses are required. Due to the large number of anticipated responses, we request you limit your response to 7 single spaced pages using 12-point Times New Roman font and 1" margins; a cover page is acceptable and will not count toward the 7 page limit.</p>
<p>The Government intends to have on-going dialog with industry. An industry day, followed by one-on-one meetings with company representatives are anticipated; although, not scheduled at this time. The Government anticipates issuing additional RFIs or calls for capability statements for this effort.<br />Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive e-mails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number.

They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population. <br>  <br> The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements. <br>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e). No formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation will be issued. Written follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland is seeking qualified sources that can provide programmable fuze systems to determine the current technology and manufacturing readiness levels for integration into the warhead of Tomahawk Cruise Missile.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL, COST AND SCHEDULE INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>Warfighting Objective:</p>
<p>The Tomahawk Weapons System Program Office (PMA-280) is exploring the potential development of a Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System (JMEWS), which will require the integration of a programmable fuze system. The JMEWS is a tandem warhead system consisting of a pre-cursor Shaped-Charge Warhead (SCW) and a penetrating Follow-Through Warhead (FTW). The system is designed to have capabilities to update target information in flight and defeat multiple target sets including "soft" and "hard" targets.<br />Information provided via this request will be used to evaluate and assess the feasibility of a fuze system concept using the existing JMEWS and Tactical Tomahawk Block IV weapon system infrastructure (i.e., weapons control systems, mission planning systems, and launcher systems).</p>
<p>Requirements and Performance of Programmable Fuze System:</p>
<p>The programmable fuze system must be a MIL-STD-1316 compliant fuze system that is capable of initiating either one independently or both warheads at predetermined distance from target. It must include multiple time delay settings that can be set after target detection and can be reprogrammed in flight. The fuze system must be capable of detonating both warheads post-impact; a secondary objective is the capability to count voids/layers with the FTW. The ability to program in a redundant time delay from impact is required. The fuze system should include a proximity sensor, an impact sensor, a SCW fuze, a FTW fuze, and all cables and connectors to the missile guidance electronics unit. An onboard data recorder for sled testing may be required as an option. Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>&bull; A description and assessment of the fuze system - which must include all components and cables of the fuze system that could be integrated with JMEWS and interfaced with the missile.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the technical risk areas in the sensor system development, integration, demonstration, and manufacturing program phases.</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components).</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Integration Readiness Level (IRL) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components) with the Tomahawk missile and weapons system (i.e., control system and mission planning).</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) of the fuze system.</p>
<p>&bull; A detailed description of the range resolution of the proximity sensor, including any environmental and surface affects, e.g. rain, sand, soil, grass, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the sensor technology capability to operate in a high threat environment consisting of electronic countermeasures and electronic support measures.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the applicable component and sub-system testing relevant to the proposing fuze system.</p>
<p><br />Technical Requirements and Constraints:</p>
<p>The fuze system is expected to be integrated within the existing space available in the JMEWS with the following requirements and constraints:</p>
<p>&bull; The system must be capable of operating on existing missile power when in flight and communicating with the missile computer to accept target programming and report status.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must also be capable of being self-powered, armed, and triggered for all static and sled testing. A device, external to the fuzes, may be used to provide simulated missile power and simulated arming stimuli for these tests.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must fit into the existing fuze wells and airframe.</p>
<p>&bull; The system will need to provide data indicating the performance of the fuze system during track testing.</p>
<p>&bull; The SCW fuze must be able to communicate through a fuel tank. This fuze must accept a trigger input from a proximity sensor, a fire command from the missile computer, or trigger on delay after impact with a "soft" target. A redundant delay time after impact will be required. This fuze must report out its arm status. This fuze must be capable of initiating an existing PBXN-5 booster. <br /><br />&bull; The FTW fuze must accept trigger inputs from the proximity sensor, a fire command from the missile computer, or trigger on delay after impact with "hard" targets. A redundant time delay after impact will be required. As an objective this fuze will be capable of counting layers or voids and initiating in a predetermined void. This fuze must be capable of initiating an existing PBXN-5 booster.</p>
<p>&bull; The proximity sensor should, at a minimum, provide a trigger stimulus at the optimum stand-off distance for the SCW. As an objective, the sensor would provide a programmable stand-off distance.</p>
<p>&bull; Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>&bull; A dimensioned drawing, schematic or other illustration of the fuze system.</p>
<p>&bull; An estimate of the overall volume displaced.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of any changes necessary to the nose structure of the missile and the vehicle's center of gravity (CG) characteristics.</p>
<p><br />Environmental Conditions:</p>
<p>Performance of a proximity fuze might be affected by environmental conditions. Existing information for a potential sensor's capability to operate reliably in these environments will aid the assessment. Respondents to this RFI should provide any applicable testing or analysis information relevant to sensor storage and operation while being subjected to the following environmental concerns:</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information is identical to N68335-13-RFI-7101 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 62 (Lighting Fixtures and Lamps).
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting comments from industry on the DRAFT Statement of Work and Specification currently being developed to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy and refinement of the SLS system specification.</p>
<p>The mission of the NAVAIR EAF Program is to provide the Marine Corps with the equipment necessary to support the rapid deployment and establishment of self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments with a minimum of infrastructure. This capability is achieved through the installation of one or more EAF subsystems, which include airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. Headquarters Marine Corps has identified the need to replace legacy EAF airfield lighting systems in order to increase operational capability. Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) meteorological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR 1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Detailed system performance parameters are provided in the supporting draft System Specification and draft Statement of Work. Comments and feedback related to these documents are welcomed and all questions will be responded to in an anonymous fashion through further postings against this synopsis.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should consider the suggested page limitations of 1 written page, 12 point font, per bulleted item below. Brochures, pamphlets and other marketing or sales media should not be provided in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI should ensure that the following areas are addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperability and control issues arising from the use of products from multiple sources.<br />&bull; Approach to obsolescence mitigation for critical technologies, e.g. LED, batteries.<br />&bull; Application of Open Architecture in order to minimize issues with redesign during the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Software approach to allow for Government support of system software over the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Experience with software development and company CMMI certification<br />&bull; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions provided in response to this RFI.<br />&bull; Ease of upgrade/compatibility with third party hardware.<br />&bull; Maximum design flexibility directed at future competitive procurements.<br />&bull; Obstacles to meeting any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Level of development required to meet any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Identify technical risk areas.<br />&bull; Provide a notional schedule to accomplish tasks outlined in SOW/Specification.</p>
<p>Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the government. Any interested parties must contact Michelle Prinston at michelle.prinston@navy.mil to request a copy of the Statement of Work and Specification.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<CONTACT>Patrick J Murphy, Contracting Officer, Email murphypj@state.gov - William Smoot, Email smootwa@state.gov
<DESC><strong>1. INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The Department of State is sponsoring an Industry Best Practice and Vendor Identification Conference to identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities, and experience to successfully deliver requisite services to sustain the Department's Aviation Fleet. The Department staff will present an Air Wing Command Briefing, present functional core and supporting contract requirements with a focus on small business set-asides, provide an open forum to ask questions, and a chance to have a one-on-one session with the Government. Industry should be prepared to discuss innovative solutions, available technology, and capabilities. This conference will be held on January 9 and 10, 2013 in Melbourne, Florida. The location will be provided as an amendment to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. <br />
<p><br />Following the overview presentations and the open discussion forum on January 9, 2013, the Government will host one-on-one sessions with interested companies, along with their anticipated subcontractor teams, provided prior coordination with the Government is established. The one-on-one sessions give companies a chance to ask specific questions regarding the program that they did not want to share during the presentation. These sessions will be limited to 30 minutes and may begin the afternoon of January 9, 2013 and between 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM on January 10, 2013 (January 11 will be an overflow day if needed). Session times will be assigned and companies will be notified of their time slot via email.</p>
<p>Information contained herein does not necessarily reflect all requirements to be found in any future solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this announcement. Responses to this announcement are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this announcement and attending the conference. All information received in response to this announcement that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly but will not be returned. Further industry comment will be requested during final definition of the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>2. SPECIAL OBJECTIVE<br /></strong>This conference will focus on the Department's intent to maximize the use of small businesses (especially HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, and Woman owned) in providing portions of the total requirement. The Department needs small businesses to inform the Government as to their capability to perform any portion of the required services. One of the conference objectives is to allow small businesses to present their capabilities in private meetings with the Government. The Government welcomes your capability statements and comments by email even if you cannot attend the conference.</p>
<p><strong>3. BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The Department of State (DoS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), Office of Aviation (INL/A) is initiating these market research activities associated with the continuing requirement for global aviation services. Chief among the myriad requirements to be contracted is the operation and maintenance of fixed wing and rotary aircraft at multiple sites in 8 or more countries in permissive and non-permissive environments and in direct support of US Government activities. Such sanctioned activities include, but are not limited to: personnel and cargo transport, aerial reconnaissance, medical and casualty evacuations, aerial herbicide application, aerial support to narcotics interdiction operations, aircraft ferrying, and emergent surge type operations. At some locations requirements include working with, and training host nation personnel in key disciplines, as defined by USG nationalization plans. <br /><br />While these services are currently under contract, the scope has grown and changed over the years and the Department desires industry input into modern industry practices and the most cost effective methods of providing requirements. This is industry's chance to help DoS redefine its requirements to take advantage of modern aviation practices. This is not a formal solicitation but is part of the Department's effort to better define its requirements for maximum contractor participation in future solicitations. The Government anticipates there may be a core operations contract with several ancillary functions competed separately during FY14 but this depends on industry input at this conference. <br /><br /><strong>4. REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong>The total dollar value of services could reach $10B over the life of the resulting contracts. The Department requests industry feedback into the most effective way to provide these services. An abbreviated list of requirements is presented below.<br />Operate and Maintain DoS Aircraft Worldwide. DoS currently has 412 aircraft in its inventory. 120 are operational globally for drug interdiction and transport of personnel. 292 aircraft are in flyable or non-flyable storage.</p>
<p>Current locations of performance are in Central Florida, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Guatemala, and Iraq. However, it is anticipated that performance may extend into other worldwide locations and the contractor(s) must be able to quickly extend operations to new locations on short notice, for limited duration. Recent examples of such include Sudan, Honduras, Malta, Libya, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Provide pilots and operational support for drug interdiction missions such as crop spraying, and the transport of personnel and cargo.</p>
<p>Provide Air Traffic Controllers where necessary</p>
<p>Provide certified maintenance personnel and qualified aviation safety personnel</p>
<p>Provide aerospace engineering services to include, but not limited to structural, electrical, avionics, aerospace, and metallurgy.</p>
<p>Provide reconnaissance missions when required, which may include sensor operation and maintenance</p>
<p>Provide medical and casualty evacuation (MEDEVAC/ CASEVAC) flights when required</p>
<p>Provide an Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) program for program crews and designated host country</p>
<p>Create and maintain all required aircraft maintenance and flight records on systems compatible with Government systems.</p>
<p>Acquire and process weather and other risk information for operational planning.</p>
<p>Operate aircraft that have been nationalized to a host Government</p>
<p>Acquire, maintain, and make available technical publications as required</p>
<p>Provide wet and dry lease of aircraft on short notice for integration into DOS fleet operations.</p>
<p>Provide cost effective logistics for maintaining the DoS and foreign agency air fleets as needed worldwide. This includes parts acquisition, tracking and accountability, as well as global shipping capacity.</p>
<p>Provide inter and intra-theater transportation at all sites, as directed. <br />Provide life support services such as food, housing, laundry and MWR for personnel in permissive and non-permissive environments. <br />Provide defensive security for air fields and housing when required. This may be coordinated through USG security elements, Host Nation elements, or subcontracted, depending on the site and situation. <br />Implement and maintain a safety program across the spectrum of the Aviation Support Services Program that ensures that all organizational activities are performed safely, taking into consideration the austere and hostile environments present throughout INL/A's operating locations. Safety of personnel is paramount. <br />Provide tactical communication, computer, and internet services for operating and maintaining DoS and foreign agency air fleets.</p>
<p>Assist foreign government agencies, such as police departments, to operate/maintain aircraft through training and logistics services.</p>
<p>In summary, the Department of State requests your assistance in helping decide how our requirements in future solicitations for air operations and maintenance should be defined for maximum efficiency and small business participation. A conference is being organized for January 9 and 10, 2013 in Melbourne, Florida. We request your participation at the conference or your comments via email if you cannot attend.</p>
<p><strong>5. INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION<br /></strong>Pre-registration is REQUIRED. This is a no-fee event and seating is limited to two (2) individuals for each company as there is limited seating. Companies are required to e-mail <strong>Jesse Lowman, @ lowmanj@state.gov</strong> no later than 4:00 PM (EST) on December 14, 2012, the following pre-registration information: (1) Company Name, (2) Company size under the applicable NAICS code 488190, (3) CAGE Code, (4) a one page company profile, (5) Name(s) of employees/representatives attending Industry Day, and (6) indicate whether your company would be interested in participating in one-on-one discussions. Attendee substitution requests may be submitted to the same point of contact by 4:00 PM (EST) on January 2, 2013. All firms must be registered in Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award of Government contracts.

<DESC>The Product Manager, Combat Support Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), is seeking information from commercial sources to satisfy its requirement for a Crew Protection Kit (CPK) for the Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF). The CPK shall be configured as a removable "plug and play" cab which provides a minimum of STANAG Level I protection. <br />The Marine Corps is currently procuring LCRTF's from Kalmar RT LLC. The approved acquisition objective for the LCRTF is 799. Approximately 100 CPK's are planned for procurement. After conducting market research, it is anticipated that the Marine Corps will release a Request for Proposals (RFP) leading to the award of a fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the CPK. <br />Balancing the various CPK characteristics will be essential to the development of a successful armor solution. The following are some of the characteristics that shall be considered and incorporated; level of protection, operator visibility and overall human systems integration, weight, and commonality of interior cab components to that of the commercial cab. The culminating challenge is development of a CPK that will meet each of the requirements while avoiding or at least minimizing the performance degradation of the forklift. To evaluate the affect the CPK will have on the forklift, the Government will be requiring a System Impact Assessment as part of the RFP.<br />To allow interested sources to view and assess the LCRTF, the Marine Corps intends to schedule site visits to be conducted at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia during the week of 22 to 25 January 2013 (tentative). The intent is to allow companies to obtain the necessary information to fully understand the needs of the Marine Corps to increase their ability to respond to the upcoming RFP. <br />RFI responses must be submitted to MCSC no later than 4:00 PM EST 18 December 2012. Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed twelve (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Responses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New. Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil.

Written confirmation of intent to participate in the future LCRTF CPK procurement; include size and status information regarding your business; <br />2. Estimated pricing to provide the LCRTF CPK; sufficient detail should be provided to explain the basis for such estimate; <br />3. Information explaining your capability to manufacture and delivery the LCRTF CPK; this should include an estimate of your notional delivery schedule; listing of key teaming partners and subcontractors and their various roles; and<br />4. Explanation as to your specific design for the LCRTF CPK.<br />Based on a review of RFI responses, the Government will contact potential sources to schedule site visits as addressed above. <br />This is only a Request for Information. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No solicitation is being issued at this time.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:		 <br>  <br> THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> TOPIC: <br>  <br> TARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise necessary to  rapidly modify a HMMWV braking system to improve stopping performance, handling, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity (CG) locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.).  The brake systems that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a HMMWV of the Governments choosing.  Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.   <br>  <br> The braking systems must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment as well as meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 105.  This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40 C to 60 C (-40  to 140  Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51 C to 71 C (-60  to 160  Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810.  Both our soldiers and vehicle components must be capable of operating effectively within this environment.   <br> 	 <br> TARDEC is requesting information on proven brake system technologies in the area of calipers, pads, rotors, proportioning valves, master cylinders, power assist/boosters, hard lines and hoses, electronic brake distribution (EBD) systems, Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS), and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems.  The Government is looking for technologies that require little to no changes to the vehicle to integrate, and that can be purchased now or quickly modified and purchased within 6 months, using existing manufacturing processes if possible, for this request. If vehicle modifications are required, as they will be with EBD, ABS and/or ESC systems, please specify the required changes, the amount of time, estimated component costs,  and level of effort needed to make the system effective. <br>  <br> Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address the category as well as address the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.   <br>  <br> QUESTIONS: <br>  <br> Proven braking system technologies <br>  <br> Objectives: - To evaluate and analyze proven braking system technologies that could be used to improve HMMWV stopping performance, handling safety, and durability throughout the Family of Vehicles (FoV) weight ranges. <br>  <br> Responders to this market survey should clearly and briefly address: <br>   <br>  	Proven braking system technologies   <br>  	Describe available solutions. <br>  	Provide any test or analysis results/reports quantifying improvement in stopping performance, handling, off-road mobility, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity locations of the current HMMWV fleet (7,100 lbs. to 16,500 lbs.) <br>  	Describe any additional work/modifications required to implement if it's not a direct one for one swap/replacement.  <br>  	Approximate cost for a vehicle kit. <br>  <br>  <br> Does your company have currently developed braking system technology that can be integrated onto existing HMMWV vehicles ranging in weight from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs.?  <br>  <br> Does your company have currently a brake system technology demonstration HMMWV vehicle that you have already integrated your technology into weighing from 7,100 lbs to 16,500 lbs? <br>  <br> Notes:  The existing brake system does not have the ability to manage the weight range of the HMMWV FoVs robustly enough to meet all Federal Safety Standards; TARDEC would like to investigate technologies that can improve the vehicle's robustness to weight change and capabilities.  Further, the designs and materials must be suitable to:  <br> i.	Withstand all shock and vibration tests specified in MIL-STD-810  <br> ii.	Operate in the temperature range of  -40 C to 60 C (-40  to 140  Fahrenheit) <br> iii.	Have a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 without additional testing or development. <br> iv.	Meet FMVSS 105 requirements for all systems <br> v.	Meet FMVSS 126 requirements for ESC proposed systems <br>  <br>  <br> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: <br>  <br> 1.	Each response is requested to include:  <br> a)	A brief (no more than one page) company description, history, and industry experience. <br> b)	An executive summary (no more than one page) of the information submitted in reply to this market survey. <br> c)	Point(s)-of-Contact (POC) with associated information. <br> d)	A brief narrative of any internal or external programs that may be leveraged to assist in the R&D of the described technology <br> e)	A brief outline of the technologies function and supporting calculations regarding the technologies ability to support the weight range of the HMMWV mentioned above. <br> f)	A brief plan for the application of a systems engineering approach as outlined by DoD Directive 5000.1. <br> 2.	Each response is requested to document any prior related government work experience. <br> 3.	Each response should be no more than 10 pages in total. <br> 4.	Each response should include a completed version of Attachment A. <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSES DUE: <br>  <br> Responses to this Market Survey are due by January 6th, 2013.  Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to Mr. Geoffrey Bossio via email at geoffrey.r.bossio.civ@mail.mil.  Please format the subject line of the response email as follows;  quote mark [Organization Name] response to Market Survey - High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) Brake System Enhancement Investigation quote mark  <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSE FORMAT(S): <br>  <br> Only electronic responses are requested.  Please provide responses in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point. Please do not send Zip Files or hard copies via mail. The maximum size of each e-mail should be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.   <br>  <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION:  <br>  <br> The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:    <br>  <br>       1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.  <br>    2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected <br>      3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,   <br>     4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS quote mark .  <br>      5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>      6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>The IRS exercised FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, clause via a contract modification to the current Contract, TIRNO12K00033, with EC America, Inc 8444 Westpark Dr Ste 200, McLean, VA 22102.
<p>It should be noted that the contractor is providing the IRS with software maintenance and subscription services for its Pitney Bowes software licenses: Spectrum Technology platform with Universal Addressing Module - US with delivery point validation and LACSlink (UAM), CODE-1 Plus with delivery point validation and LACSLink, Finalist with delivery point validation and LACSLink, Canadian CODE-1 Plus and CODE-1 Plus International. The IRS has a variety of systems and applications which use taxpayer mailing addresses to send IRS required notices and letters. Currently, these systems use multiple licenses from the Pitney Bowes software products to perform the address validation.</p>
<p>The Government will negotiate directly with EC America, Inc on a sole source basis. A FSS JOFOC was prepared on the basis of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B, only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized, as EC America, Inc is the current contract holder. This option was exercised at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and extended the period of performance end date from December 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013. As the six month extension includes the period of tax filing season it is imperative that these software maintenance and subscription services be continued without interruption to ensure taxpayers receive timely communications from the IRS.</p>
<p>EC America, Inc is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. In addition, EC America, Inc is the only authorized reseller of Pitney Bowes software maintenance and subscription services on GSA Schedule. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Jennifer Henley at: Jennifer.N.Henley@irs.gov no later than December 30, 2012 at 10:00 am ET.</p>

Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur. 

Under the authority FAR Part 8.405-6 (B) (2) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct an Industry Day to present an upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the ASD(R&amp;E) Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM) Program. Hybrid Energy Storage Modules (HESM) with high power and energy densities, high rate capability, scalable to all power levels, will maximize performance, enhance fuel efficiency and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles and platforms. This capability is intended to store electrical energy while having variable charge &amp; discharge rates in high power density modular-reconfigurable configurations. These systems include combinations of power and energy devices such as battery-capacitor, battery-flywheel, or battery-battery (different types), etc, are intended to enhance integration of existing power systems with energy storage, providing maximum safety, reliability, efficiency, and security of operation with minimal installed storage, overhead, and cost.
<p>This BAA will address three areas for development and demonstration of the concept of hybridized energy storage for the purpose of supporting highly transient loads via a coordinated, multiple-device approach in the DoD development areas Aircraft and Large Power. The Aircraft development area will examine the utilization of HESM to improve More Electric Aircraft (MEA) electrical power quality, component lifespan, and overall system performance for all flight conditions, including possible weight and volume savings. The Large Power development area will examine continuous transient support and fuel efficient operation for megawatt scale grid operation with application for Navy shipboard and Air Force/Army Large FOB applications.</p>
<p>A third development area in the BAA will develop and demonstrate of a safe energy storage structure which is capable of not only buffering against life-reducing high operating temperatures due to aggressive cycling operations but will also prevent/limit thermal runaway conditions through the integrating novel thermal management methodologies and advanced materials. This structure has applicability across DoD applications.<br /><br />Teaming on this upcoming BAA is highly encouraged in order to provide the complete skill set required to be brought to bear in these identified development areas. With a view toward speeding the incorporation of new science and technology into fielded systems, partnering among industry and those awarded under the ARPA-E AMPED program is also highly encouraged.<br />The purpose of the Industry Day is to discuss the BAA development areas as well as overall partnering opportunities with ARPA-E AMPED program. General and specific questions related to the pending BAA will not be accepted during the meeting for consideration but will be answered once the BAA is posted on the ONR contracts web site</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be held at Qinetiq-NA, 4100 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22203 on Wednesday December 12, 2012. There will be two identical sessions in the morning and afternoon to accommodate additional attendance. Check in for the morning session will begin at 0845am Eastern Standard Time and the meeting will begin at 0930 Eastern Standard Time. Check in for the afternoon session will begin at 12:45pm Eastern Standard Time and the meeting will begin at 1:30PM Eastern Standard Time. Details concerning registration to attend this event are available at the following website: <br /><br />AM Session: https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=905<br />PM Session: https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=906</p>
<p>Registration will close at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, 7 December 2012. Pre-Registration is required. Walk-ins will not be permitted. Attendees must be US citizens.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOTs) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) plans to award a contract, purchase order or delivery order to M2 Technology, Inc., for the Oracle RightNow CX Cloud Service, for the calendar year 2013.  The customer relations management (CRM) software will be used to provide support to the National Transportation Library (NTL) Reference Service.  The license is usually renewed on an annual basis.  

The NTL provides a central location for questions and answers about transportation and transportation data submitted by US Department of Transportation staff and other Federal Agencies.  RightNow Technologies CRM is the software currently used to serve as the knowledge base for the reference team.  The software enables tracking and custom reporting of interactions, publishes a FAQ database to the web for self service, and provides automatic responses for bulk and campaign emails.  M2 Technology Inc. is the only reseller of RightNow CRM.  

USDOT has no other option for purchasing RightNow CRM software, because M2 Technology is the sole reseller of RightNow CRM. 

Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than M2 Technology will be able to provide this software.  
Nevertheless, any entity, other than M2 Technology, which believes they can provide the needed software services to RITA shall submit a capability statement to Dwayne.Cross@dot.gov  no later than 1:00 PM EST on December 15, 2012.

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority for FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days (15) after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District intends to specify the following manufacturers product in the Joint Special Operations University (JSOU), MacDill AFB, FL project in order to properly manage the high density customer work spaces required by USSOCOM-J6 in its new data center. USSOCOM requires Corning Panduit or Ortronics distribution components product lines. Specific components included jacks, faceplates and patch panels.   <br> This project will include constructing a multi-story facility with precast concrete exterior wall panels.  Project includes site improvements, landscaping, communications and anti-terrorism/force protection.  Construction consists of concrete pile foundation, structural steel framing, reinforced concrete slab, fire protection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, security system, assured telecomm architecture, HVAC and built up roof. <br>  <br> USSOCOM has experienced unprecedented growth since September 11, 2001. The USSOCOM compound is expanding into new buildings, and is continually reorganizing and reconfiguring existing offices spaces. This reorganization requires standardization of the communications infrastructure and supply components to provide reliable networks and telephone service to offices and cubicles. The compound is now divided between four component product lines. There is a continuing objective to reduce this to the two product lines that have historically provided a sustained high level of service; Panduit and Ortronics. As parts of the compound that don't have Panduit or Ortronics components are remodeled or reconfigured, either the Panduit or Ortronics product lines are used to rebuild the communications infrastructure. The USSOCOM user population at MacDill AFB has grown to over 3000 people working in 20 temporary, leased and permanent buildings (over 600,000 square feet) with six operations centers and dozens of conference rooms. This work is supported with data networks at three classification levels and three telephone systems (at three classification levels). Every seat in the command gets a minimum of two data networks and one voice. That entire infrastructure is modified, operated and maintained by an in-house staff of only five people, military and contractors. The four major SOCOM MILCONs resulted in those infrastructures being built with four different product lines, Molex, Hubbell, Panduit and Ortronics. This presents problems in maintaining stocks of parts, storage and training. Each product line is supposed to be compatible with any other; however, that compatibility is limited. Each has its own fit parameters, field assembly methods and some have special tools.   <br>  <br> Every facility reconfiguration or renovation project necessitates the reconstruction of the communications infrastructure. In every case (which is constant) the infrastructure is built back with Panduit or Ortronics products. The goal is to reduce, down to only two, the number of different supply/parts, assembly methods/training and tools, needed to maintain the campus. So, the goal is the same for any future major MILCONs, to reduce the number of infrastructure product lines down to two. These two product lines (Panduit and Ortronics) were chosen for their quality and excellent performance and durability, over the years of growth and reconfiguration of the SOCOM campus. A high level of reliability is needed to support not only the pace of change but the level of support required in a four star command headquarters. Considering the cost in lost productivity, calculated in staff salaries alone, puts the impact of just a few component failures high enough to justify the extra cost of quality parts. A GS-13 earning $48 an hour who discovers a computer problem which may require half a day to troubleshoot and repair a bad jack, has lost the government $192 in productivity. The average salary in SOCOM is GS-13. So annually if only 1% of the population have similar work stoppages the government loses $5,760 per year. That is easily doubled considering the time spent by the multiple contractor and military personnel involved in the troubleshooting. So in addition to the logistical, operational and training problems with maintaining materials for four different product lines, SOCOM could be losing over $11,000 a year in lost productivity. <br>  <br> Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufactures name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.   Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br> 1-	Price: Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing.  <br> 2-	Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on whether the past performance submitted for consideration is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance. <br> Past Performance Evaluation Ratings: <br> Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br> For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement, must be completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and the magnitude must be over $25,000.00(Euro 18,102.50).In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Past Performance is considered to be not relevant if it is not similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement,  if it is not completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and if the magnitude is under $25,000.00 (Euro 18,102.50).The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  Send protests (other than protests to the contracting officer) to: <br>  <br> HQ Army Materiel Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. <br> Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 <br>  <br> Packages sent to FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: <br> HQ Army Materiel Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 1412 Jackson Loop <br> Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 <br>  <br> The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: <br> http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp <br>  <br> If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.

<p>This product will be evaluated as an occupational safety intervention to prevent shoulder injuries in automotive manufacturing. This study is being conducted in collaboration with Toyota Motors and, through pilot testing, Toyota has identified the Equipois zeroG-2 mechanical arm as the most appropriate workplace control to support nut running torque tools in the assembly of the vehicle chassis. Toyota has conducted preliminary evaluations to determine that this particular device has the highest probability of success as an intervention to prevent shoulder injuries. As such, the evaluation of this specific workplace intervention was proposed in a research proposal that was subjected to a scientific peer review and ultimately awarded funding based on its scientific merits, likelihood of success, and potential for impact. Substitution of another product would jeopardize the probability of success of the project that was justified in the research proposal.<br /><br />A Firm-Fixed Price purchase order will be issued in writing to the successful offeror. To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this solicitation, a contractor MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). www.sam.gov The quote format is at the discretion of the offeror.

<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance<br />ii. Price</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

<p>(c) Purpose of GFM: The contractor warrants that any fabric obtained from the government is required for use in connection with the garments to be furnished under this contract.</p>
<p>(d) Responsibility for GFM: The contractor assumes the risk of, and is responsible for, any loss or damage to GFM regardless of the cause, from the time the fabric is delivered to the contractor to the time it is returned to the government. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to obtain such insurance, as he/she may deem necessary, at his/her own expense.</p>
<p>(e) Deficiency or Delay in Furnishing GFM: The delivery or performance dates for the supplies to be furnished by the contractor under this contract are based upon the expectation that the GFM will be available for delivery to the contractor within the specified time. In the event the GFM is not available for delivery to the contractor by such time, the Contracting Officer will, if requested by the contractor, make a determination of the delay.</p>
<p>(1) In the event the contractor believes that damages or defective GFM, exclusive of normal imperfections, has been furnished, or in the event of shortages, narrow widths, or other discrepancies, the contractor shall immediately notify, in writing, the damage, defect, or discrepancy to the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall not cut or use such Government Material, or in the event the damaged, defect, or discrepancy is such that it could not reasonably have been discovered until after cutting or further processing, the contractor shall not further process the Government material until instructions have been received from the CO. If replacement is to be made, the government will replace at its own expense, including transportation costs, any such damaged or defective material.

Under no circumstances will the Government include as an element of any adjustment under this "Explanatory Note" any amount for loss of prospective profits. Further, the provisions for adjustment are exclusive, and the Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract by reason of any delay or deficiency in furnishing GFM to the contractor.</p>
<p>(3) Fabric containing normal deficiencies shall not be considered defective. Any claim for shortage within the roll shall be adjusted as follows: for shortages on individual pieces only, credit will be taken by the Government for the minus tolerance provided for individual pieces in the "Examination for Length" paragraph of the fabric specification; for the entire shipment found to be longer than the length specified on the piece ticket. Narrow widths shall be subject to adjustment only where the discrepancy exceeds &frac14; inch. Measurements shall be "overall" or "exclusive of selvage", in accordance with the width provision of the applicable fabric specification.</p>
<p><br />(f) Protection of GFM, Title, Access.

<SOLNBR>SPM1C1-12-R-0088
<CONTACT>Michael Curry, Phone 215-737-0559, Email Michael.Curry@dla.mil - Pat Martin, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-3980, Fax 215-737-3276, Email patricia.a.martin@dla.mil
<DESC>It is the Government's intention to issue a Sole Source c(1) award to Creative Apparel Associates for the current JPACE and Field Expedient Repair Kits requirements.
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to advise the industry that DLA Troop Support and the Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) office will be conducting reviews for certification of interested parties in becoming an approved supplier of the COVERALLS, CHEMICAL, JOINT PROTECTIVE AIR CREW ENSEMBLE (JPACE) in Sage (class 1), Universal Camouflage (class3) and Field Expedient Repair Kits (OFERK and LFERK), in accordance with JPMP-PD-JPACE-01B (dated 23 April 2012). DLA Troop Support intends to issue this announcement annually.</p>
<p>In order to be considered, those sources interested in being certified as cut and sew manufacturers for JPACE and Field Expedient Repair Kits shall submit an official request for consideration on company letterhead to the DLA point of contact indicated below within sixty (60) days of the posting of this announcement:</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support<br />Attn: Michael Curry, Bldg 3-C-6019 <br />JPACE Certification Request<br />700 Robbins Ave<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111-5096</p>
<p>Or email the request to: <br />michael.curry@dla.mil or patricia.a.martin@dla.mil</p>
<p>Certification procedures will be in accordance with the Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE) Chemical Protective Coverall (CPC) and Field Expedient Repair Kit Certification Plan (dated 11 September 2012).</p>
<p>Upon receipt of interest, DLA Troop Support will provide applicable technical documents including Purchase Description (JPMP-PD-JPACE-01B, dated 23 April 2012), Packing, Packaging and Marking Instruction (JPMP-PPMI-JPACE-01B, dated 23 April 2012), paper patterns and non-disclosure agreement. A Vendor Supplied Data package will be required which includes a Manufacturing Capability Assessment Questionnaire, Manufacturing Capability Summary, Past Performance Summary (List of ongoing and completed contracts, systematic improvement efforts, and quality award certifications) and Statement of Financial Condition along with instructions on how to order material from supplier. Authorization for release of primary material to cut and sew manufacturer will be withheld pending the JPM P review of the Vendor Supplied Data package. Offerors will be advised in writing, of the decision with regard to each interested party's acceptability for continued evaluation; which would then require the submission of 3 male coveralls, 3 female coveralls and 10 Lining Field Expedient Repair Kits. These coveralls will be subjected to visual and dimensional examination and if acceptable, subjected to a laundering test. All costs associated with the generation and submission of requests, data, and certification samples will be borne by the vendor.</p>
<p>Certification of a potential source occurs prior to, and independently of, any contract award to that source. Certification of a source does not guarantee a contract for production, but rather identifies a cut and sew facility as having demonstrated the necessary levels of quality and manufacturing capability. Certification is the responsibility of the JPM P. Upon certification of a potential source, the JPM P will issue a Manufacturing Certificate and that source will be placed on the Procurement Control Drawing for the JPACE and Field Expedient Repair Kits and will be eligible to compete.</p>
<p>A potential source must be certified in accordance with the JPACE CPC Certification Plan to be considered for award. If awarded a contract, certified sources will be required to submit production representative samples for a First Article Test prior to authorization to begin full-rate production.<br />At this time Creative Apparel Associates (CAA) is the only approved certified source of the JPACE and Field Expedient Repair Kits. Concurrent to the government certification review above, an acquisition is being directed to CAA under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following quantities: <br /><br />COVERALLS, CHEMICAL, JOINT PROTECTIVE AIR CREW ENSEMBLE (JPACE) <br />TYPE I, CLASS 1 - SAGE GREEN FOR MEN <br />PGC: 03585 <br />NSN: 8415-01-546-1842(s) <br />No. of Sizes in Tariff: 27 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Base Year&nbsp;&nbsp; Option 1&nbsp;&nbsp; Option 2<br />Guaranteed Minimum (MIN)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;17,444&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,926&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,926<br />Annual Order Limitation (MAX)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 29,028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9,630&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9,630<br />Annual Estimated Quantity (AEQ)&nbsp; &nbsp;23,222&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,704&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,704</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT - NRMJ0000-13-00201</p>
<p><br />Description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needs:<br />Provide continued operation of a Private Line T1 Data Circuit including service and repairs between the Department of Commerce Table Mountain facility in Longmont and the main campus at 325 Broadway Street, Boulder CO.</p>
<p>The current line is proprietary and serviced through QWEST Government Services Inc. dba CenturyLink QGS (QWEST). Any new vendor will need to replace the QWEST line currently in place with their own T1 cabling. This would include monitoring the removal by QWEST of lines currently in place and installation of the new vendor T1 lines without QWEST. The removal and installation costs will need to be included in the Base Year cost. This cabling infrastructure is for the single use of the remote and relatively small amount of scientific instrumentation and systems.</p>
<p>Most of the buildings on Table Mountain were constructed in the late 1950s and &lsquo;60s which is <br />the same time period when copper cables were installed by the local phone company; probably <br />then Mountain Bell (QWEST). These cables are old, temperamental, and poorly documented.<br />The T1 communications link now serving Table Mountain uses the old cables.</p>
<p>No updated or advanced telecommunications services have been installed or required for <br />installation since the original copper services. Any type of wireless system is unacceptable <br />because of the strict radio frequency silence regulations on Table Mountain.</p>
<p>NOAA maintains several field sites on the top of Table Mountain, an experimental radio <br />frequency quiet zone approximately 12 miles north of Boulder. Some personnel are located at <br />the site and several different data sets are gathered in real time there. In order to support e-mail <br />and general network connectivity for the personnel located there and to facilitate in the timely <br />retrieval of the data sets, a fiber optic network was built by DOC/NOAA personnel to inter-<br />connect the separate Table Mountain buildings on and the T1 communications link was installed <br />to connect the site back to the David Skaggs Research Center, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO <br />80305. It is this T1 circuit from the demark at one of the buildings on Table Mountain, back to <br />the vendor wiring box along the road that leads to table mountain that is solely QWEST.</p>

<DESC>This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a       
source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of   
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing 
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor      
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the  
intended application.  Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and        
selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review      
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession   
and cannot be economically obtained.                                           
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not     
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have    
been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally 
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you 
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the   
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)  
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on  
your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if     
this is an item you have never made.
                                           
                                                                               
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS 
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required  
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data    
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award      
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval      
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval        
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet      
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based   
on Fleet support needs.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>PUMPING
<p>1. QUESTION: One turbo molecular pump corrosive gas turbo system capable of pumping speed for N2 350 l/sec. Air or water cooled?<br /><br />ANSWER: Air cooled.</p>
<p>2. QUESTION: What are the specific corrosive gas or gasses and the<br />Concentration?</p>
<p>ANSWER: There are no corrosive gasses. Materials will be out gassing under higher temperatures and vacuum, but these materials are like oils, plastics, etc...</p>
<p><br />3. QUESTION: Section 2 calls for a 28" X 28" thermal plate and a 5 sided thermal shroud.<br />However, section 4 calls for a solar simulation unit with a 20" feedthru port. The 28" X 28" thermal plate covers the bottom of the chamber. If the 5 plates that make up the thermal shroud cover the remaining 4 walls &amp; the ceiling of the vacuum chamber, then it is not clear how the solar simulation unit can direct the simulated solar light onto the specimen under test because the thermal plate &amp; shroud plates are covering the floor, ceiling and all of the walls of the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The one panel will have a 12" by 12" pass-through to allow for light from the solar simulator to pass.</p>
<p>THERMAL</p>
<p>1. QUESTION: In Section 2 regarding the plate &amp; shroud, the plating is called out as "gold-plated". Is it Type 1, 2 or 3 gold plating and what the plating thickness is and the thickness tolerance (&plusmn;) if any?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Type III and the thickness must be greater than 100 micro inches.</p>
<p><br />SOLAR SIMULATOR UNIT</p>
<p>1. QUESTION: Some solar simulators require 5kW lamps to get to 1 Sun irradiance over the<br />12" x 12". A 1.6kW lamp to get to 1 Sun irradiance over the 12" x12. Can you please confirm if the required solar simulation specification will be met with 1 Sun irradiance over the 12" x12" under AM0 conditions?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes the 1.6kW lamp will work.</p>

The EPA registered the Bioquell Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor system?s sterilant claim for rooms up to 3,500 Ft3 that covers both porous and non-porous materials indicating a six-log kill of endospore forming bacteria ( and all organisms lower on the Spaulding scale). Also rooms can be decontaminated in approximately 90 minutes based on 155 cycles in 750ft3 rooms. 
Most other products are considered decontamination aids and not room sterilizers. Some companies offer a product that does similar work through a UV light system but none of them kill to a six log standard only about 2 or 3 log.  There may be a few other products that use the vapor hydrogen peroxide system but, to my knowledge, they are not as fast nor are they as safe because they do not test the sealed off room for leaks., 1, EA; <BR>LI 002, TRAINING, 1, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9iyylaBEJ5RKQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.</p>
<p>UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING JCP:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DLA Energy has been accommodating those vendors that have not received certification through JCP by providing information via email with the submission of the DD2345.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, effective January 1, 2013, that method will no longer be utilized for this procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please ensure DLA Energy is immediately made aware of any issues with receiving your certification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages.</p>
