<DESC>RECOVERY - Horizon Scanning System

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis for a contract to establish a Horizon Scanning System, to be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.  This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent.

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.hhs.gov.  Interested offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

ARRA appropriated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER), of which $300 million is allocated to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The goal of CER is to improve health outcomes and the quality of care by providing evidence to inform and enhance medical decisions made by patients and their medical providers.  AHRQ is using ARRA funds to expand and broaden current CER activities and to support new initiatives in CER.  This solicitation presents AHRQ’s effort to implement its own horizon scanning system in order to identify new and emerging issues for comparative effectiveness investments through the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program.  Horizon scanning involves: 1) the identification and monitoring of new and evolving healthcare interventions that are purported to or may hold potential to diagnose, treat or otherwise manage a particular condition; and 2) an analysis of the relevant healthcare context and landscape in which these new and evolving interventions exist in order to understand their potential impact on clinical care, the healthcare system, patient outcomes, and costs.  This project will provide AHRQ with a systematic process to identify and monitor healthcare technologies that are likely to have a high clinical, system and cost impact in the US.  The AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System shall be informed by existing methods but incorporate novel and innovative approaches.

The purpose of this project is to meet an immediate need at AHRQ to establish a horizon scanning system.  Through this procurement, AHRQ seeks to quickly and efficiently implement a horizon framework and infrastructure to immediately generate information that will inform comparative effectiveness research investments through the Effective Health Care (EHC) Program.  It is expected that a majority of the effort necessary to accomplish the required tasks below will be dedicated to the implementation of a horizon scanning system and to the actual conduct of horizon scanning.

The performance requirements of this solicitation are as follows:
•	Refine and implement a protocol to identify and monitor new healthcare technologies.
•	Refine and implement a methodology to forecast the future clinical, system, and cost impact of identified technologies.
•	Report on findings from horizon scanning activities (through scheduled, periodic status updates and topical reports requested by AHRQ).
•	Review methods of horizon scanning used by public and private organizations in the US and internationally.  
•	Develop a plan to evaluate the implemented horizon scanning protocol and methodology.

Methods proposed by the Offeror to accomplish the above tasks shall be based on a justified scientific rationale, and the Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of horizon scanning methods.  The Offeror shall also demonstrate familiarity with and understanding of its proposed healthcare horizon scanning methods, and personnel shall have experience relevant to implementing proposed methods.  Additionally, Offerors shall demonstrate the capacity to implement their proposed technical approach to the above performance requirements from a management perspective.  Consideration will be given to the Offeror’s demonstrated ability to quickly and efficiently implement its proposed methods as well as the Offeror’s ability to provide substantive status updates and in-depth reports on its horizon scanning activities.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to implement horizon scanning protocol and methods as well as produce written reports that are scientifically and methodologically rigorous.  Offerors shall also demonstrate the capacity to conduct horizon scanning over the two-year performance period of contract and quickly respond to requests for additional reports at the request of AHRQ.  

The Project Team shall consist of a Project Manager, Project Director, and other key staff, which can include subcontractors and/or consultants.  

The Project Director shall have, at minimum, a doctoral or medical degree and have demonstrated knowledge of healthcare technology innovation and diffusion in the context of the US healthcare system and experience overseeing projects involving the development and assessment of relational data.  Additionally, the Project Director shall not have less than ten (10) years of total work experience which includes: 1) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals; 2) knowledge of payer (including Medicare) policies; and 3) knowledge of FDA regulatory requirements for drugs, devices and biologics.

The Project Manager shall have training and experience in health services research, development and implementation of quality improvement strategies and personnel/project management.  In addition, the Project Manager must have experience in working with diverse groups such as innovators, healthcare providers and purchasers, clinical and health service researchers, and healthcare policymakers.  The Project Manager shall have, at a minimum, a Master’s degree in a health and human services-related specialty and at least ten (10) years total work experience which includes: 1) at least eight (8) years in a health-related field; and 2) demonstrated skills in organizing and monitoring complex projects conducted by groups of diverse professionals.

Other key staff shall also have demonstrated experience in developing and analyzing relational data; working with issues related to healthcare technology innovation and diffusion in the US; payer (including Medicare) policies; and FDA regulatory policies.  

AHRQ anticipates awarding one firm, fixed-priced contract under this solicitation for a period of 2 years and 3 option years.  Proposals will be evaluated inclusive of the options.  The Government is under no obligation to exercise the options either at award or at a later date.

<DESC>The AMCOM Contracting Center, on behalf of Program Director  Aircraft Survivability Equipment, intends to solicit a twenty-one (21) month Technology Demonstration (TD) program for a laser based Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) system to protect rotary wing aircraft from IR guided missiles.  The Government intends to release a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) program.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this DRAFT RFP.  This effort will be solicited on the basis of full and open competition.  Source selection procedures contained the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 15.3, shall be utilized to select the successful offer after release of the formal RFP.  Contractors pursuing award of a Government contract must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to being awarded a DoD contract.  Although no final decision has been reached at the time, the Government reserves the right and intends to exclude foreign participation in the solicitation and source selection process.  A hybrid Cost-Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price contract is being contemplated.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541712.<BR><BR>The requirement exists to integrate a laser based CIRCM system to the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).  The need for a relatively mature system and the risk associated with unproven technologies has resulted in a change to the weight requirement and a proposed change to the acquisition approach for the CIRCM system.  In accordance with the new requirements, prototype B-kits for the TD phase must weigh no more than eighty-five (85) pounds.  In addition, A-kit weights for small rotary wing aircraft must not exceed thirty-five (35) pounds and A-kit weights for larger rotary wing platforms must not exceed seventy (70) pounds.  The TD phase will not support the development of new or high risk technologies that have not already been demonstrated in a relevant environment.  The intent of the TD phase is to develop and test mature CIRCM prototypes to demonstrate Probability of countermeasure (Pcm), reliability, and safety of flight performance.  During the TD phase vendors must deliver 12 sets of initial prototypes.  The first six (6) sets must be delivered nine (9) months after contract award and the second six (6) sets must be delivered ten (10) months after contract award.  The TD phase will culminate in a PDR that incorporates all lessons learned through testing into a design that can be detailed in EMD.    <BR><BR>The US Army intends to release the DRAFT RFP within two weeks of this synopsis and to subsequently hold an Industry Day to address questions and comments as a result of industry review of the DRAFT RFP.  Interested firms should submit all questions and comments on the DRAFT RFP acquisition approach, schedule, Performance Work Statement (PWS), and evaluation criteria in writing to eddie.whitfield@redstone.army.mil.   Detailed information about the Industry Day and the specific deadline for the submission of vendor questions and comments will be provided at the time of the release of the DRAFT RFP.  Interested parties should monitor the Army Single Face of Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Opportunities Web Site on the AMCOM Contracting Center Public Web Site for release of the DRAFT RFP and the formal RFP.  No telephone requests for the DRAFT RFP or formal RFP will be accepted.  If you are unable to access the ASFI Web Site, you may fax your request to 256-842-8029, ATTN: CCAM-OS-S, Eddie M.

Maintenance on a hybrid system would be complicated, and most likely more expensive with two manufacturers.

<CONTACT>John Albrecht, Program Manager, Email DARPA-BAA-10-45@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of efficient middle ultraviolet (200-300 nm) emitter technology. The goal of the Compact Mid-Ultraviolet Technology program is to develop the essential heteroepitaxy, waveguides, cavities, and contacts to enable efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) and chip-scale semiconductor lasers operating at wavelengths below 275nm. Other compact technologies resulting in mid-UV lasers will also be considered to the extent that an overall footprint and performance competitive with a semiconductor solution can be reasonably achieved. These ultraviolet devices will significantly improve the size, weight, power, and capability of chemical/biological-agent detectors, portable water purification illuminators, and numerous other UV-dependent applications with respect to existing systems.<br />Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

<SUBJECT>La Grande Air Tanker Base - Runway Ramp Design
<SOLNBR>AG-05K3-S-10-0023
<RESPDATE>042110
<CONTACT>Justin C Holder, Contracting Officer, Phone 360 891-5082, Fax 360 891-5081, Email jholder@fs.fed.us - Eric R. Neckel, Procurement Technician, Phone 3608915080, Email eneckel@fs.fed.us
<DESC>PROJECT INFORMATION:

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Wallowa-Whitman National Forest has a requirement for engineering services related to the repair of pavement at the La Grande Air Tanker Base.  The intent of the Forest Service is to procure a design for the repair/reconstruction of a ramp that provides access to the La Grande Airport taxilanes and runways.

The La Grande Air Tanker Base is located at 59973 Downs Road, La Grande, in Union County, Oregon.  The Air Tanker Base is a significant National and Regional Fire Management Asset.  It provides fire suppression support services to 35,000 square miles of Southeast Washington, Northeast Oregon, and Central Idaho.  During a major fire event, it can support up to 6 air tanker aircraft, 3 lead or attack light aircraft and 40 personnel.  During an average season, 160 loads, or 390,000 gallons, of retardant are dispatched for fire suppression activities.

The ramp requiring repair is an asphaltic cement concrete area that is an essential component of the base providing areas for the following:  1) parking and loading of aircraft, 2) maintenance inspections and work on aircraft, and 3) access to the La Grande Airport taxilanes and runways.  The ramp facilities have an inadequate pavement structure for fire support operations performed at the site.  Repair and reconstruction of the ramp area is required to allow continued use of the site by air tankers and lead/attack light aircraft which support of wildland fire suppression.

The current pavement structure has extensive cracking due to thermal expansion occurring in the pavement.  In 2004, a capital improvement project provided new facilities at the site:  an air tanker base operations building, a hot shot crew office/training building, a fire retardant tank farm, and various site improvements.  The Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) loading pads and the Asphaltic Cement Concrete (ACC) immediately surrounding the pads were part of the project work.  However, the larger portion of the ramp area, with existing thermal cracking was not reconstructed due to a loss of funding.  The thermal cracks were then cleaned and filled with a crack sealant.

During 2006, Regional Aviation and Forest Fire personnel visited the site and determined that the ramp area had major, and severe, thermal cracking across an area of  90,000 square feet of the ramp.  This cracking had extended approximately twenty feet into the reconstructed ramp area near the loading pads and filled cracks had reopened or expanded in width.  The cracks vary from 1 inch to 8 inches in width and are currently 6 inches to 8 inches in depth.  

This project will provide engineering design services for the Air Tanker Base ramp structure that;

•	Result in a structurally sound, safe ramp that provides resistance to thermal expansion and cracking
•	allows access by all types of aircraft between the parking areas, ramp access, and airport runways
•	provides a safe, efficient working space for the parking, loading, and maintenance work that occurs at the base
•	provides a stable pavement with a minimum expected life of 20 years

<SUBJECT>Development of rhIL-15 (E. coli) cGMP Lyophilized Clinical Product
<SOLNBR>ST10-1033
<RESPDATE>042310
<CONTACT>Howard R. Souder, Jr., Subcontracts Specialist, Phone 3018465096, Email souderhr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Please download the attached document for specific instructions and more details. Failure by any offeror to follow the instructions detailed will be interpreted as non-responsive, and will not be considered by SAIC-F.
<p>Project Title: Development of rhIL-15 (E. coli) cGMP Lyophilized Clinical Product</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>IL-15 is a 14 - 15 kDa member of the 4 &#61537;-helix bundle family of cytokines. It shares a number of biological activities with IL-2, including stimulation of the proliferation of activated CD4+, CD8+ and gamma-delta subsets of T cells. Recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) expressed in E. coli was manufactured by the BDP under cGMP to yield active rhIL-15 for cancer therapy adjuvant vaccines in human clinical trials. The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for the development of a cGMP lyophilized product for future clinical studies.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>A previous study (data to be provided to the selected Subcontractor) demonstrated that rhIL-15 formulated in a Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer was stable and retained its potency following lyophilization. Preliminary assessment of lyophilization parameters resulted in a uniform cake formation with minimal cracks. An ideal moisture value of &lt; 1% was not attained and additional cycle development studies are needed before GMP activities are initiated.</p>
<p>Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be required to submit a Project Management Plan (PMP) describing the means of accomplishing the Project Tasks. The PMP will include milestones to meet the Project Deliverables. Milestones will include but are not limited to 1) completion of the R&amp;D lyo studies and 2) completion of cGMP production. <br /><br />Risk Management Plan</p>
<p>The PMP will include a risk management plan (RMP) to identify potential technical problems that might arise during the course of work. The Subcontractor shall suggest solutions or alternative back up plans to address these potential problems.</p>
<p>Reports and Meetings</p>
<p>1. Project meetings will occur bi-weekly or as required by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (SAIC-F COTR).<br />2. Subcontractor will submit monthly technical and financial status reports to the SAIC-F COTR and SAIC-F Subcontract<br />Specialist.<br />3. Reports will include lyophilization cycle profiles, technology transfer report, certificates of analysis and a manufacturing report for the GMP process that will support clinical use of the resulting GMP materials.</p>
<p>Project Tasks:</p>
<p>1. Develop a lyophilization cycle based on the formulation previously evaluated by SAIC-F using the vendor's equipment that is translatable to cGMP production of 4000 vials with a fill concentration of 50ug rhIL-15/vial.<br />2. Recombinant human IL-15 will be formulated into the Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer and provided to the vendor for Lyophilization-cycle development at a small scale of 10 - 20 mg; with an expected net yield of 200 - 400 vials 50ug/vial reconstituted to 1 ml). The components for container/closure are listed in Appendix A of this document.<br />3. The lyophilized vials will be evaluated for:<br />a. Reconstitution time<br />b. Acceptable cake appearance<br />c. Osmolality and visual appearance upon reconstitution to be free of particulates<br />4. Upon satisfactory completion of Task 3, samples will be provided to SAIC-F for analysis by (i) Potency, (ii) RP-HPLC, (iii) HPLC-SEC/LS, (iv) Protein Assay (Coomassie), (v) Moisture Content (Karl Fischer), (vi) Opalescence, (vii) Sterility, (viii) Endotoxin content.<br />5. Task 2 will be repeated with 200 mg rhIL-15 lyophilized to reproduce the small scale study results with an expected net yield of 4000 vials at 50ug/vial.<br />6. Criteria for deliverables shall include a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analyses,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 as defined by item 4 above and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />7. Preparation of cGMP batch production documentation. <br />8. Receipt and controlled storage of cGMP bulk rhIL-15 from the BDP.<br />9. Completion of aseptic vialing and lyophilization for rhIL-15 to net at least 4000 vials at 50 ug/vial.<br />10. Completion of all required CMC documentation of the lyophilized clinical product to enable an IND filing. This shall include regulatory documentation to cross-reference or submit the necessary Subcontractor facility, operation and quality system information for an initial IND filing.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>Criteria for deliverables shall consist of a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including but not limited to: <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analysis,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables will be approved by the SAIC-F COTR.<br />All cGMP deliverables are also subject to the final review of documentation and release by the SAIC-F Quality Assurance department.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months from the date of award of the Subcontract.</p>
<p>Other Requirements</p>
<p>1. Facility audit for technical capability and cGMP compliance must be completed and found to be satisfactory to the SAIC-F Quality Assurance team prior to a Subcontract being awarded by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>2. Execution of a Quality Agreement prior to subcontract award must be made between the potential Subcontractor and SAIC-F.

<p>Modern Electron Microscopes such as the three Tecnai series microscopes are manufactured by FEI Company and currently installed in the Laboratory of Cell Biology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). These highly complex instruments require continuous servicing by qualified engineers since they encompass high vacuum components, electromagnetic lenses, charge coupled device (CCD) cameras and pneumatic systems all integrated into computer controlled access to the various microscope functions.</p>
<p>Each of the three microscopes has its own CCD Camera with the Polara microscope having an additional CCD camera as part of the Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF). Because of the special nature of the CCD technology these cameras and the GIF are independently serviced by Gatan Inc. engineers only. The cameras and the GIF need to be periodically aligned within the FEI electron microscopes and recalibrated with respect to their sensitivity to the electron dose.</p>
<p>There is a complex level of digital access to the FEI microscope and its CCD Cameras and GIF permitted only to the qualified Gatan service engineers. Gatan certified service engineers are trained in all aspects of service to the electron microscope CCD cameras and GIF and are authorized solely to service these instruments. The warranty on the microscope, CCD cameras and the GIF is guaranteed only if service is provided by Gatan Engineers. Therefore no company other than Gatan can provide the service for the Gatan CCD cameras and the GIF. It is therefore imperative that each of the four (4) CCD cameras and the GIF are serviced through the proposed source. The proprietary software controlling the electron microscope, CCD Cameras and the GIF are continually upgraded and must be completed by qualified Gatan service engineers only. For these reasons, there is no other source known to the NCI capable of providing service to the specified equipment.</p>

The Contractor will then return to install new #1 Blue Label wood shingles at 4 " exposure using stainless steel fasteners, new galvanized flashing and new ridge boards on each 19' x 80' roof section (approximately 3,450 square feet). This phase of work addresses the lower sections of the barn roof only.  The work will be phased so only one side is being done at a time, starting with the East (town facing) side first.

<a href="mailto:Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov">NICOLE MODAFARI</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD) is seeking contractor support on a requirement entitled An Exposure /Dose model for Integrative Risk Assessments. This requirement involves extensive research efforts on multimedia, multiroute, and multipathway exposure and dose modeling.  The availability of the Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies (MENTOR) and Dose Response Information and Analysis (DORIAN) systems in the public domain has made it possible to apply state-of-the-art approaches in forward and inverse exposure modeling for systematically characterizing and evaluating critical issues and gaps in a comprehensive risk assessment framework for multimedia environmental toxicants. USEPA needs these tools to be part of the operational tools for risk assessment.  
The purpose of this effort is to provide USEPA scientific staff with novel computational modeling and informatics tools including databases, demonstrations and evaluations that can be used to support integrative risk assessments.  These tools are to be delivered in a customized user-oriented platform that will facilitate their future application to a wide range of exposure studies.  It is proposed to acquire a user-oriented, customized implementation of MENTOR in modeling cumulative and aggregate exposures and doses to arsenic (As) and its compounds. Arsenic was selected as a ?model chemical? because it is a multimedia contaminant with multiple routes and pathways of exposure and a variety of chemical forms, toxicity endpoints, and modes of action. 
The EPA is seeking a contractor to (1) compile and document available data sources required for population exposure and dose modeling, (2) produce, evaluate, and deliver state-of-the art modeling approaches for forward modeling for exposure and dose estimation, (3) produce, evaluate and deliver state-of-the-art approaches for inverse exposure modeling from available biomarker data, and (4) perform sensitivity/uncertainty analysis and identify data gaps in forward and inverse modeling of exposure; develop recommendations for future data collection efforts.  
The emphasis will be on cumulative and aggregate exposures to multimedia contaminants that involve multiple routes (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption) and pathways (diet, drinking water, etc.), specifically:
1. Demonstration and evaluation of a user-oriented operational system employing state-of-the-art, forward and inverse modeling methods and comprehensive databases for assessing cumulative and aggregate exposures and doses for risk characterizations involving multimedia chemicals.
2. Characterization and reduction of uncertainties in exposure and dose modeling in multimedia contaminant risk assessments and development of recommendations on priorities for filling data gaps and performing focused research tasks related to specific applications.
3. Development and optimization of informal guidelines and other supporting material to facilitate future applications of the delivered modeling system to a wide range of risk assessment problems involving multimedia chemicals.
4. A demonstration and evaluation, using arsenic as the contaminant, to improve various elements of the risk assessment process, not only for arsenic but also for a multitude of multimedia inorganic and organic contaminants of interest to USEPA.
The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract to span a 2 year duration. We anticipate that the solicitation will be posted for 30 days beginning in April. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis, with no small business set-aside. A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487-2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.

Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:grant.a.hoover@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineer - Omaha District</a>
<DESC>Description of Work for Vancouver Barracks:<BR><BR>Project Name and location: Vancouver Barracks, Vancouver, Washington.  Vancouver Barracks consists of 55.6 acres and is located approximately one-quarter mile north of the Columbia River and immediately east of Interstate 5 in Vancouver, Washington.<BR><BR>Scope of Current Request: The Vancouver Barracks project consists of two sites; the Columbia River Site and the Western Portion Site.   The Columbia River site was a Government pier for the Army from 1849 to 1948.  During WWII, this area was a large shipyard called the Kaiser shipyard.  During that time, munitions were dumped into the Columbia River.  No known unexploded ordnance (UXO) responses have been completed.  The Western Portion site has been used since the original settlement of Vancouver Barracks in the early 1800s, as a strategic military post.  UXO has been found on site during excavations of development and archaeological investigations.  A Closed, Transferring, and Transferred Range/Site Inventory Report and Historical Record Review were completed for the facility and a Site Investigation (SI) for these sites was planned in the Installation Action Plan.  <BR><BR>The primary objective of the Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) SI is to determine whether a project warrants further response action under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act - aka SuperFund) or not. The SI will need to collect the minimum amount of information necessary to make this determination, as well as it (i) determines the potential need for a time critical removal action (ii) collects or develops additional data, as appropriate, for Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and (iii) collects data, as appropriate, to characterize the release for effective and rapid initiation of the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  Additional objectives of the MMRP SI are to collect the additional data necessary to (i) complete the Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP); and (ii) develop a more refined cost-to-complete (CTC) estimate.<BR><BR>Key Design Resources Required:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Safety Expert with underwater diving experience, and underwater geophysics expertise.<BR>

<DESC>Under Statutory Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Medrad, Inc., Indianola, PA for Stellant Dual Head CT Injector which is both FDA approved and compatible with the existing equipment at the Tomah VA Medical Center located in Tomah, Wisconsin.  The product provided by Medrad Inc is the only Stellant Dual Head CT Injector which is the first Injector worldwide to feature and be FDA approved for P3T-patient weight based Cardiac Imaging.  The Medrad Stellant Dual Head CT Injector with P3T Proprietary and Protected Software now mandates that the clinical staff enter each specific cardiac patient's weight, contrast concentration, scan duration and max flow rate. Once the individual parameters are entered, the protocol will be automatically calculated to maximize cardiac enhancement throughout all cardiac structures. This is the first and only CT Contrast Injector in the world to feature patient weight based specific dosing protocols-maximizing enhancement and patient safety. This announcement is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1. The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by March 26, 2010 by 4:00 PM CST. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. All interest received on or before     March 26, 2010 will be evaluated by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open  the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The 685th Armament Systems Squadron (ARSS), Eglin AFB, FL is conducting a market survey for a manufacturer (Prime Contractors only) of Bomb Live Unit-122 (BLU-122), a 5000 pound class of penetrator warhead case. During this manufacturing effort the government intends to purchase up to 300 fully assembled warhead cases ready for explosive fill. The explosive fill process is not part of this market survey. This effort will include the full process of obtaining Eglin Steel-1 (ES-1), forging, heat treating, and manufacturing, with subcomponents, the warhead case. Deliveries will begin six (6) months after contract award.<br />The Government is looking for Prime Contractors to demonstrate their value added efforts and those of their Partners or Critical Subcontractors. Prime Contractors must provide a written description of their past performance in production of the following: ES1 steel; large scale machining and tooling abilities to meet the size and weight requirements listed below; and explain the respondents' organizational structure, management and systems engineering experience, accounting , quality assurance program, safety program, configuration management, technical skills of their work force and those of any subcontractors, and production / operational process control procedures. The process control procedures should include how the prime will control the entire process, through each subcontractor, the responsible quality control processes, and how fault isolation and identification would occur. Written documentation shall be no more than eight (8) pages, Arial Font, 10 or 12 pitch, with one inch margins.<br />The respondents interested in producing the BLU-122/B warhead must be able to produce, handle, and account for a number of manufacturing processes at various vendors and at the necessary quality called out by the United States Government (USG) Draft Technical Data Package (DTDP) during production. A copy of the DTDP is available upon request from the 685th ARSS, Ms. Grisselle Nusimow, at grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil. <br />To aid the respondent, the following information is provided to give some detail as to the overall program requirements:<br />Warhead Description<br />The BLU-122/B warhead case assembly consists of a steel casing made of ES-1 steel, with 22 subcomponents and associated hardware (bolt, nuts, washers, screws, etc.)/coatings (paint, adhesives, greases, etc.) mounted internally and externally to the case resulting in a combined weight of approximately 3,664 pounds. The overall case dimensions are approximately 159 inches in length with a major diameter of 16.02 inches and a sustained diameter of 15.30 inches culminating in a point at one end and a blunt end at the other. The internal case is bored to a depth of approximately 132 inches with a bore diameter of approximately 12 inches culminating in a 3.5 inch spherical radius at the end of the bore. In addition, the case has six (6) equally spaced .75- 10UNC holes located approximately 27.75 inches from the tip/nose of the warhead case.
<p>Subcomponents<br />Subcomponents consist of a Fuze Liner, Fuze Liner Retainer, Eutectic Closure Retainer Ring Assembly, Charging Tube Fitting, Charging Tube Nut of both plastic and steel, 9 Hole Aft Closure with vent port plugs, Vent Port Plugs, Protective End Cap, Charging Tube, Arming Well, Shipping Plugs, Suspension Lugs, Corrosion Inhibitor Spacer, Protective Nose Cap, and associated subcomponents. Drawings are available as part of the USG DTDP.</p>
<p>Steel Ingot/Billet Production<br />The respondent must be able to produce ES-1 Ingots according to the requirements in the USG DTDP and should be in a minimum geometry to allow for at least a 2.5:1 reduction ratio during forging. This chemical composition includes components such as tungsten and nickel, thus it is imperative that any respondent have access to high quality scrap and have the ability to process these types of alloys. The respondent should have quality control processes to ensure that alloy segregation during ingot solidification is controlled. Annealing and/or controlled cooled furnace cooling is desired.</p>
<p>The forged billet should be roughly 16.25 inches in diameter and 181.25 inches in length. The temperature of the billet should start around 2200 deg F and should not fall below 1600 deg F during forging operation.

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact: Clint Boyle, AFRL/PKMP, (505)853-3161. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Entergy directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) to Optigrate, Orlando FL. The objective of the proposed research is a demonstration of a compact beam combiner based on multiplexed volume Bragg gratings recorded in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass which provides efficient superposition of the 5 coherent beams from fiber amplifiers driven at the testbed developed at AFRL (KAFB). The volume Bragg grating will take the 5 beams which are incident at 5 different angles and super impose the 5 beams on top of each other in space and direction. This optical element illuminated by a single laser beam from the opposite direction is a 5-channels beam splitter. The effort will take place in two phases. The first phase will result in the delivery of a prototype beam combiner to be tested in the AFRL fiber laser testbed. The second phase will result in the delivery of a beam combiner having refined specifications. <br /><br />A. For the first phase, the contractor shall develop: o A prototype volume Bragg gratings in a single substrate<br />o A prototype will be designed to combine five diffraction limited, narrow band (&lt;0.01 nm) laser beams at 1064 nm. The diameter of combined beams (full width 1/e2) will be nearly identical and will not exceed 8 mm <br />o In a beam combining mode, the beams will be incident at prototype at angles - 10.0 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;, -5.0 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;, 0.0&plusmn; 1.0&deg;, 5.0 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;, 10.0 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;, and a combined beam will be normal to the surface o In a beam splitting mode, the incident beam will be normal to the surface and transmitted beams will propagate at angles described in the previous item <br />o The diffraction efficiency in a beam splitting mode should be 20+/-5% for each transmitted beam o Total material and diffraction losses in a beam splitting mode should not exceed 10% <br />o The grating should be able to handle total powers of up to 750-W<br /><br />B. For the second phase, the contractor shall develop:<br />o A refined reflective volume Bragg gratings in a single substrate<br />o A holographic optical element will be designed to combine five diffraction limited, narrow band (&lt;0.01 nm) laser beams. The diameter of combined beams (full width 1/e2) will be nearly identical and will not exceed 8-mm.<br />o In a beam combining mode, the beams will be incident at -9.6 &plusmn; 0.1&deg;, -4.8 &plusmn; 0.1&deg;, 0.0&plusmn;0.1&deg;, 4.8 &plusmn; 0.1&deg;, 9.6 &plusmn; 0.1&deg;, and a combined beam will be normal to the surface <br />o In a beam splitting mode, the incident beam will be normal to the surface and transmitted beams will propagate at angles described in the previous item<br />o The diffraction efficiency in a beam splitting mode should be 20+/-2% for each transmitted beam<br />o Total material and diffraction losses should not exceed 5%<br />o The grating should be able to handle total powers of up to 750-W<br /><br />A contract will be issued to Optigrate provided other sources cannot provide the services at more favorable terms.

<a href="mailto:bauerwl@id.doe.gov">Wendy Bauer, Contract Specialist</PRESOL>N/A</a>
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to issue a sole sourcemodification to extend the period of performance under contract DE-AC07-99ID13727 with Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI).  Due to unplanned delays in the selection process, more time is needed to complete all activities necessary for contract award and transitioning to a new Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) contract.  The current period of performance ends March 31, 2010.  DOE intends to extend the contract up to six (6) months (six (6) one-month options) through September 30, 2010.  The anticipated dollar value of the extension is $11M per month, up to a maximum of $67M.
The extension will enable DOE to meet the Settlement Agreement milestone of shipping 2,000m3 of transuranic waste out of the state of Idaho per year.  BBWI will continue to retrieve stored waste from the Transuranic Storage Area-Retrieval Enclosure and storage modules, and ship approximately 660 cubic meters (m3) per month, up to a maximum of 4,000m3, of TRU waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.
The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion codified at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  BBWI is uniquely qualified to carry out the AMWTP work through the extension because it has the management structure and correct mix of skilled workers in place to fulfill the requirements set forth by the Settlement Agreement and the Recovery Act work.
This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement.  Any responses must be received no later than 4:00 p.m., local prevailing time, March 19, 2010, to be considered.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
Perform HGM Evaluations: Evaluations of conservation and management strategies for ecosystems in North America have evolved to incorporate information, and base landscape-scale decisions, on:  1)  geomorphology, soils, and topography of landforms; 2) basic ecological processes that created and sustained communities especially hydrology, disturbance mechanisms, and community dynamics; and 3) relative degree and type of alteration to structure and processes.  These landscape-scale evaluations are embodied within the contemporary "hydrogeomorphic methodological (HGM)" approach.  HGM is a three-stage process that:
1.	Determines the historic condition and ecological processes of an area/region and its surrounding landscapes from a variety of historical and current information including geomorphology, soils, topography, hydrology, floral and faunal accounts, maps, etc.2.	Identifies physical, ecological process, and biotic changes to the ecosystem in the region from the historic condition.3.	Identifies options and approaches to restore and manage specific communities and ecological conditions.
Specifically, the first part of the HGM approach determines and models the historic landscape context and configuration within a region by developing a "matrix" of understanding of which plant communities historically occurred in different geomorphic, soil, topographic, and hydrological settings.  The matrix is developed using comprehensive scientific data discovery and field calibration using published literature, community reference sites, and botanical correlation.  For example, wet meadow  habitats in Western U.S. Intermountain floodplains are often  distributed on older Holocene alluvial terraces, on silty-clay soils, within the 2-5 flood frequency occurrence topography, and where surface water sheetflow occurs.  The beauty of the first part of HGM is that landscapes ranging in geographic scale from site-specific areas (individual refuges) to entire watersheds (e.g., the San Luis Valley) can be mapped in an objective way based on scientific information and analyses - and, this information provides perspective on which communities belong in which locations and how they interacted and were juxtaposed.
The second part of HGM describes real-world alterations to system hydrological condition, topography, vegetation community structure and distribution, and resource availability to key fish and wildlife species by comparing historic and current landscapes.  This analyses essentially is a detailed  assessment of current condition and the types and magnitudes of changes to ecosystem structure and function, including assessment of which communities are most destroyed and degraded, their resilience to changes, and the possibilities of reversing degradations.
Third, HGM provides options and approaches to restore and manage specific areas, communities, and sites within the landscape-scale context chosen.  The foundation of ecological history coupled with assessment of current conditions helps to determine which system processes (e.g., periodic spring overbank flooding from tributaries of the Rio Grande River) and habitats (wet meadows) can be restored or enhanced, and where this is possible, if it is at all.  Obviously, some landscape changes are more permanent and less reversible (e.g., water-control dams on the Rio Grande River) than others (e.g., conversion of native grass or shrubland to small grain production).  Through development of the HGM matrix, NWR managers and other conservation conerns can identify:  1) which, and where, habitat types have been lost or altered the most and establish some sense of priority for restoration efforts, 2) where opportunities exist to restore habitats in appropriate geomorphic, soil, hydrological, and topographic settings including both public and private lands, 3) how restoration can replace lost functions and values including system connectivity and provision of key resources to meet life cycle requirements of endemic species, and 4) what management methods, infrastructure, and intensity will be needed to sustain restored communities.
In summary, HGM provides a science-based approach to understanding the physical and ecological attributes of landscapes and specific areas within them such as NWRs,  how the NWR area historically contributed to larger geographical scale ecosystem functions and values, and essentially its possible role in contemporary and future conservation of these landscapes.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirement stated below. This is not a synopsis for a Request for Proposal (RFP). The notice is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a RFP. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), is the primary Research and Development (R&D) arm of DHS. S&T is tasked with researching and accessing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help federal, state, and local governments protect the homeland. S&T has the responsibility to prepare future generations of scientists and engineers to protect the Nation by giving qualified researchers the opportunity to work along side S&T professionals to develop the tools to protect Americans. DHS S&T takes a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing issues of homeland security and seeks candidates with expertise in the physical, biological, engineering or social sciences.

DHS S&T is planning to award a contract to a contractor capable of supporting S&T host offices by providing highly trained scientists and engineers (fellows) who will contribute their scientific, technological, and engineering knowledge and expertise and external perspectives to the broad range of issues that DHS addresses. The proposed contract is for a one year base period and four one year options. The anticipated contract award date is January 1, 2010. 

The prospective candidates selected by the contractor must demonstrate exceptional competence in areas of science or engineering; have excellent written and oral communication skills; have the ability to work in an interdisciplinary setting with policy-makers and other non-scientific partners; be cognizant of and demonstrate sensitivity toward political and social issues; and, perhaps most importantly, have a strong interest and experience in applying their knowledge toward the solution of homeland security threats and issues. Areas of focus and support include: explosives detection, social and behavioral sciences, risk, economics, and decision science, human factors, chemical threats and countermeasures, biological threats and countermeasures, food and agriculture security, transportation security, border security, immigration studies, maritime and port security, infrastructure protection, natural disasters and related geophysical studies, emergency preparedness and response, communications and interoperability, and advanced data analysis and visualization.
 
The contractor will invite applications from individuals in any physical, biological, or social science, any field of engineering, or any relevant interdisciplinary field. Applicants must have a PhD, MD, DVM, Dr.PH, or an equivalent doctoral-level degree by the application deadline.  Individuals with a masters' degree in engineering and three years of post-degree professional experience may apply. Federal employees are not eligible for the fellowships. Applicants must be US citizens. The fellowships will be for one-year appointments, potentially renewable for up to four additional years. Stipends will be provided by the contractor to the fellows in amounts consistent with a candidate's education, experience and salary history, with allowances for health insurance, relocation and professional travel. Placement at DHS will be arranged with the assistance of the contractor, and will reflect the Fellow's interests and expertise. 

The contractor will be responsible for identifying, reviewing, screening, and recruiting candidates through a competitive selection process from a broad array of backgrounds and a diversity of geographic, disciplinary, gender, and ethnic perspectives, coming from a range of sectors including academia, industry, and NGOs. The contractor will conduct placement interviews with selected candidates and agency host offices to insure compatibility between projects, expertise, and interests, match finalists with DHS offices, and issue offer letters to confirm final assignments. The contractor’s managers and other staff shall collaborate and interact regularly with cognizant DHS personnel throughout the entire placement process. 

Responses to this sources sought synopsis, including capability statements, should be no more than five (5) pages). Any material submitted should be at the unclassified level. Capability statements should be sent via e-mail to sharon.flowers1@dhs.gov  by 5:00 pm Eastern Time on April 21, 2009 with the title of the project in the subject line.

In accomplishing any work under the contract, the Contractor is totally responsible for full compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations and therefore shall be required to keep current all licenses, permits, etc., that may be required by said governing agencies.  Necessary also is compliance with all applicable OSHA, EPA, and 49 CFR (DOT) requirements, including but not limited to HM-18.  Copies of these documents to include US EPA certifications and State EPA hauler registration shall be made available to the Contracting Officer and/or the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) upon request.

The plan at a minimum must define methods used to protect contractor personnel, VA patients and employees, and the nearby population during packaging and removal operations.Pick Up and Packaging: At both VA facilities (Dallas and Bonham) there will be no centralized pickup point nor will the VA be responsible for any pre-packaging.  Therefore it shall be the responsibility of the Contractor, under the direction of the COTR, to visit those areas within the facilities identified by the COTR as requiring hazardous waste removal services.  Preferred Disposal Method: The Contractor should refer to the VANTHCS preferred hierarchy when determining disposition of waste.  The hierarchy is as follows:  1. Recycling; 2. Incineration (Part B incinerators); 3. Treatment (neutralization); 4. Landfill.

Waste approved for transport to storage stations shall not be comingled in the same shipping container with waste from any other generator.NOTE: Due to constantly changing requirements, VANTHCS cannot provide an accurate inventory of waste that the Contractor can expect to remove each quarter.  Therefore, the Contractor shall provide an invoice for each removal, and only for the materials removed.The intended contract period will be for a base year and four, one-year option periods.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Environmental Conservation Division located in Seattle, WA 98112 on a sole source basis with University of Washington. <br />The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. The potential impacts of chronic algal toxin exposure have long been a concern. One HAB toxin, domoic acid (DA), is a potent neurotoxin that interacts with the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Although the clinical signs of acute DA toxicity have been well defined, virtually nothing is known about the impacts of chronic, low-level toxin exposure, primarily due to the difficulties associated with long-term exposure studies. We know that vertebrates such as fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and humans are exposed to DA on a regular basis at levels below those that cause outward signs of toxicity, yet we have no idea how these chronic sub-acute exposures may impact these organisms. In the present study, we use global gene expression in whole brain and morphological aberrations in major organ systems as endpoints to examine the effects of chronic exposure. The overall goal of this project is to develop a general model for the characterization of gene expression effects in the vertebrate CNS and morphological damage in major organs associated with long-term, low-level toxin exposure.<br />Proposed vendor shall perform the following: <br />1. The contractor will receive and store all zebrafish brain samples from the year-long exposure <br />study. Samples will be delivered to the contractor on a regular basis throughout the study and <br />must be stored at -80&#61616;C. <br />2. The contractor will perform all RNA extractions and provide quality assurance/control of <br />RNA samples (130 samples in year one and 130 samples in year two).<br />3. The contractor will analyze all samples for differential gene expression using microarray technologies that have been developed for zebrafish and for our specific exposure regimes and sample types (brains).<br />4. The contractor will provide qRT-PCR to validate microarray results for all brains individually (20 brains X 13 time points X 5 genes = 1300).<br />5. The contractor will provide "hands on" and "in person" bioinformatics services/tutorials for data analysis to National Marine Fisheries Service, Environmental Conservation Division when requested. This requires using the contractor's bioinformatics tools, computers, and software. We anticipate using this type of service up to 8 times over the two years of the project.<br />Proposed vendor shall deliver the following:<br />1. Collection, proper storage and analysis of zebrafish brains collected over the year-long study.<br />2. Regular meetings and progress reports to National Marine Fisheries Service, Environmental <br />Conservation Division regarding data quality and results.<br />3. Management and proper storage of the enormous amount of data obtained from the microarray <br />analyses.<br />4. Hands on personal tutorials on how to best manipulate the data using the contractors "state of <br />the art" computers and bioinformatics tools.<br />5. Data manipulation and summaries such as tables, figures, and other analytical outputs as <br />requested.<br />6. Regular interactions and guidance on the processing and interpretation of the data.<br />The UW personnel who will work on this project have worked with our group over the last 6 years to develop and validate the requested analyses for these unique exposure studies in zebrafish. We have two previous studies in which these same analyses have been performed at the UW facility. It is imperative that the same laboratory analyze the samples in the present study so that we can properly compare new results with previous results. This is a critical component to the success of this study. The Functional Genomics Laboratory at the University of Washington is fully equipped with state of the art equipment and software for microarray analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistics. In addition to "state of the art" facilities, the scientists committed to this work have extensive experience in microarray analyses, bioinformatics, and data interpretation. These scientists have worked with our team before on<br />pilot studies to troubleshoot and develop the protocols for our specific zebrafish brain samples. Results from these preliminary studies have provided the "proof of concept" needed to assure success of this type of long-term effort (this is a year long exposure period with 13 tissue sampling time points throughout the study). They have validated protocols ready to go for our brain samples and have helped develop the most statistically robust sample design for this study. The UW Functional Genomics Laboratory currently houses all of our previous data. It is imperative that we work with this group to insure the proper storage, quality and access to all of the data associated with these studies.<br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately April 2010 with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. It is anticipated that work will commence on April 2010 to Sept 2010.<br />This notice represents the only official notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0008 to the Raytheon Company (Raytheon) El Segundo, CA for US Navy and US Marine Corps F/A-18 AN/APG-65/73 Radars.  The Raytheon Company is the sole designer, developer, manufacture, and supplier of AN/APG-65/73 radar.  Raytheon alone possesses the peculiar engineering capability, resources, and expertise necessary to complete the Government’s minimum requirements without causing unacceptable delays in meeting the Navy’s operational schedule and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The effort includes specialized engineering for obsolescence issues on these radar systems which Raytheon designed.  As such, Raytheon is considered the sole company deemed capable of completing the effort without unnecessary delay and cost.  The obsolescence and logistic sustainment support to the US Navy is critical for maintaining aircraft effectiveness and fleet readiness.  This Synopsis is for informational purposes only.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>On a SOLE SOURCE basis, and under the authority of Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), the Bureau of Transportation Statistics’ (BTS), and the National Transportation Library (NTL), located at 1200 New Jersey Ave. S.E. Washington, DC 20590, intend to award a SOLE SOURCE contract to LRP Publications (LRP) for cyberFEDS®, the online Legal Publication, for the following DOT Modes: The Maritime Administration, The Federal Railroad Administration and RITA.  It is believed that LRP is the only source for cyberFEDS® and that no other type of services will satisfy the Agencies’ requirements.  

cyberFEDS® keeps federal professionals up to date on the rapid changes in the federal government. cyberFEDS® helps employees stay on top of the ongoing changes with daily news coverage and a timeline of changes written by experienced federal human resource journalists.  New documents are added as soon as they’re available and current. cyberFEDS® documents and features are constantly reviewed and amended to make sure that readers get the most accurate guidance available.		
		
A subscription to cyberFEDS® on the Web includes:

•	Department/Agency Personnel Documents
•	Classification/Qualification Library (includes FPMs)
•	EEO Library (EEOC)
•	Labor Relations Library (FLRA and arbitration awards)
•	Employee Relations Library (MSPB)
•	Pay & Benefits Library (Comptroller General)
•	Workers’ Compensation Library (ECAB decisions available at an additional charge)
•	Forms Library
•	News Archive
•	Online Conferences
•	cyberFEDS® Roundups
•	cyberFEDS® Case Central
•	Online User’s Guide
•	Quick Start Guides

•	Checklists Plus+

o	A Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law and Practice, 2006 by Ernest C. Hadle


All of the features listed above are required by the Agencies named above.

HOWEVER, any person or any organization (other than LRP Publications) which believes that it is capable of fully meeting the Agencies’ requirements as described above, and capable of meeting those requirements at the high level of quality indispensable to the Agencies, may e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to james.mowery@dot.gov not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time April 9, 2010.  Even if such a Statement of Qualifications did succeed in proving the capabilities of the submitter, it would not necessarily win any contract for the submitter, because the submitter then would have to compete for the contract on the basis of quality and comprehensiveness and usability of product, on price, and on past performance.

<DESC>***DO NOT SEND QUOTES OR SAMPLES***   This is not a solicitation, these are VA answers to contractor's questions/comments on draft specifications.Black color= draft specifications.Blue color= contractor's questions/commentsRed color= VA response		BATH TOWEL 20 BY 40 INCH1	Fiber content shall be 86% cotton and 14% polyester or 100% cotton  There are wide variances in the draft specifications, which can lead to discrepancies in quality and large price differences.  Is there one specification that the VA prefers, or can more than one product be proposed to fall within these specifications.The VA should decide if it requires a blended 86% cotton, 14% polyester blend or 100% cotton.  100% cotton is more expensive than a blended productWould advise changing this to something more akin to "shall be at least 86% cotton" which would allow for any/all blends between 86/14 and 100% cotton.  As currently written, a 87/13 or 88/12 or 90/10 blend would be unacceptable but an 86/14 would meet spec.  Also advisable to indicate that pile yarn must be 100% cotton (this will force any synthetic utilized into the "ground" of the towel).We want both options so the field has a selection of quality to choose from.  There will be separate line items on the solicitation for 86% cotton 14% polyester towel and 100% cotton towel.Also there are other blends available such as bamboo, while it is more expensive it offers double the life cycle of a blended product.   Not interested in this at this time for not all companies have this product as of yet.  NO we do not want to consider other blends. Are the loops for the terry ring spun or open end carded cotton terry loops?  The VA will accept either one as this will not be specified. 2	Size of bath towel shall be 20" x 40" finished product Does the finished size have to be exact?  Industry convention is for non-apparel textiles to be sold as cut size.  A 20"x40" towel would not typically be delivered as a 20"x40" finished size.  Specifying this finished size will require "non-stock" production which may elevate acquisition expense.  Also, the weight per unit area will be reduced as compared to terry made to same weight but specified as cut size.Specification changed to: Finished product size of bath towel shall be 20" x 40" plus or minus .25 inch. 3	Weight per dozen of bath towels shall be within the range of 5 lbs - 6.25 lbs [1 towel - 6.66 to 8.33 oz]  The weight must be from 6-8 lbs per dozen.Most typical 20 x 40 weight per dozen ranges from 5-5.5 lbs, would that be ok?Generally, the acceptable weight range for terry is +/- 5% per dozen.  Weight is not ordinarily specified or validated on a per piece basis.  In this case, it would be advised to specify as something such as 5.5 lbs./per dozen +/- 5%Specification changed to: Weight per dozen of bath towels will be a minimum of 5 lbs per dozen or 6.66 ounces each.4	"VA Property Not For Sale" must be name woven (not printed) in a blue center stripe the entire length of towel.  When specifying colors like blue or white the Color Card of America should be referenced so colors can be quality controlled and specified.Name woven must be in white on white, no color is good for reusable towels, as any color center stripe will bleed during bleaching, and if you do not bleach a white towel, it will become yellow after a couple of washes and look bad.  What good would white on white be as you can't see the logo then.  We want this so the laundries or facilities don't have to label them VA Property Not For Sale.Does it matter what color blue? Color does not matter; we just chose blue for that was what we had last time.  We don't care what color of blue as long as it's blue.Are the letters 2" high?  Yes we want 2" letters.Are the letters blue or are the letters white contained in a solid blue woven band?Letters are blue.5	Each side of the towel shall have a selvage edge not less than " or more than " wide  Selvedge can only be on the 2 sides (length side) " to " wide.Are the selvedges hemmed or self selvedges?Tolerance as stated here is very narrow in scope and may create high level of QA rejection (and increased cost).

However, it would be advisable to add a specification for the yarn size to be utilized in the loop or pile portion of the towel - such as 16/1 Pile YarnThis is the size of the loops on the towel. All towels are looped with variance of sizes as it makes for a higher quality towel. This spec stands as is.9	Manufacturing Label (fabric content, care instructions, Country of Manufacture)  	The specification should address how these products are to be    laundered.	             Even though care instructions means the exact same    thing.     Specification changed to: Manufacturing Label ( fabric content,   laundry instructions, Country  of Manufacture)  							BATH TOWEL 24 BY 48 INCH1	Fiber content shall be 86% cotton and 14% polyester or 100% cotton   Would advise changing this to something more akin to "shall be at least 86% cotton" which would allow for any/all blends between 86/14 and 100% cotton.

These       products must meet the requirements of the FAR-World Trade Agreement with regard to country of manufacturer and source of the actual base product.    Does it matter if it is an approved country?Are there any restrictions on country of manufacture?   Inter-name woven towels are only    possible if the VA would waive FAR =country of origin   requirements.  This particular style of towel is only made/substantially transformed in Pakistan and China.   When it is not a FAR Part 19 small business set-aside then the business size does not matter, and the place of manufacture is domestic, outlying areas, OR designated countries.ANY OF THE COUNTRIES BELOW ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT"Designated country" means any of the following countries: (1) A World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement country (Aruba, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (known in the World Trade Organization as "the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" (Chinese Taipei)) or United Kingdom); (2) A Free Trade Agreement country (Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Peru, or Singapore); (3) A least developed country (Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Yemen, or Zambia); or (4) A Caribbean Basin country (Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, or Trinidad and Tobago).    When a FAR Part 19 small business set-aside is utilized it falls under the Buy America Act.  This act requires the non-manufacturer rule.  This rule says that if you are a non-manufacturer (ie a distributor) that you must provide the products of a small domestic or outlying area manufacturer.  Of course the offeror must be in the proper small business set-aside category (ie SDVOSB) whether a distributor or manufacturer.  "Outlying areas" means- (1) Commonwealths. (i) Puerto Rico. (ii) The Northern Mariana Islands; (2) Territories. (i) American Samoa. (ii) Guam. (iii) U.S. Virgin Islands; and (3) Minor outlying islands. (i) Baker Island. (ii) Howland Island. (iii) Jarvis Island. (iv) Johnston Atoll. (v) Kingman Reef. (vi) Midway Islands. (vii) Navassa Island. (viii) Palmyra Atoll. (ix) Wake Atoll.                    Do I need an FSS Contract to make an offer?          No.          Will the packaging be in bales, or boxes?          Boxes.What numbers of the 250,000 towels are to be 20 x 40 versus 24 x 48?    Estimated quantities for each line item will be on the actual solicitation.

Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA: F34608-02-H-5000-0003. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the Division of Intramural Research (DIR), Genetics and Development Biology Center, Electron Microscopy Core Facility, intends to award a single fixed price purchase order for the purchase of a JEM 1400 Transmission Electron Microscope and accessories, in accordance with the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12. This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (12/10/2009).

The procurement is being conducted on a non-competitive restricted basis, with no set-aside restrictions.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the following system from JEOL USA, Inc. 11 Dearborn Drive, Peabody, MA 019650.

The Government=s anticipated delivery date is six (6) months after receipt of purchase order.

a.	Computed tomography capacity to generate high resolution d-dimensional reconstructions at the macromolecular up to the fine subcellular level of resolution.  Computed tomography can reveal structures and relationships not apparent by other techniques
b.	Time-saving capability to store and rapidly access operation settings for different users and applications
c.	Low magnification, high contrast imaging with a wide field of view to facilitate area selection for higher magnification viewing and for acquisition of low magnification images for analysis.
d.	Automated montage generation, which is very useful for morphometric studies and can save many hours of user time
e.	Automatic adjustment of brightness with magnification changes, making viewing and image acquisition more efficient
f.	Multiple exchangeable specimen rod tips, allowing exchange of specimens without disturbing orientation for re-examination of specimens, and 5-specimen holder for rapid specimen comparison
g.	Lab6 filament, which has greatly increase lifetime, minimizing down-time for filament changes.	
h.	Must offer installation support and training of SerialEM and IMOD through the JEOL APPs Division for a total of one (1) week (five (5) business days including travel).	
The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) serves as the nation’s premier research arm for biomedical study.  The purpose of the EM Core Facility is to provide advice, technical services and training to NHLBI scientists when their projects call for electron microscopic analysis. In the 3.5 years since the inception of the NHLBI Electron Microscopy (EM) Core Facility, the volume and scope supported projects has increased several-fold, as has the number of transmission EM (TEM) users who are not EM Core staff.  In the past year, the Core has supported 26 different projects for 17 NHLBI principle investigators.  There are 7 current user of the TEM in addition to the 3 Core staff.  The JEOL TEM in the EM Core is the workhouse of the core.  More than 90% of data from the EM Core is generated on this TEM.  It is a JEM-1200EX that was purchased in 1988 and at some point in the next several years, service will become a problem.  Although still operational, it lacks certain features offered by the current model JEOL TEM, the JEM-1400.  These features would greatly increase the ease and efficiency of operation and the range of technical capabilities.

<DESC>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a separate written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ No. NLM-10-107-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.<br /><br />Project Purpose<br />In order to continue to provide leadership within the national research community in the area of software development for image analysis, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is currently revising and updating its open-source image processing application programmers interface (API), known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). NLM has determined that it is time to revisit the foundations of the toolkit to assure its viability for the next ten years. In the intervening decade since the original design of ITK, computing technologies have made radical advances including the advent of multi-core microprocessors, 64-bit CPU architectures, and a proliferation of graphics processing units (GPUs) capable of general purpose computing. NLM is in the process of funding a major new software release, ITK version 4.0 (ITK-v4), which will take advantage of these emerging computing technologies.<br />We propose a new outreach effort to broaden the user community and deepen the impact of ITK. The objective of this program is to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of revisions and improvements planned for ITK-v4. The emphasis of this new effort will be testing the software framework, broadening application development efforts, and data sharing to promote open science. Awardees under this program will contribute to the redesign process by supplying user requirements during the planning of the revision effort as well as evaluating the new version, ITK-v4, through their proposed projects.<br /><br />Individual ITK development projects under this procurement should not exceed $150,000 in cost nor surpass 1 year in duration. <br /><br />A. Background<br />In 1999, the NLM Office of High Performance Computing and Communications awarded multiple contracts for the formation of a software development consortium to create and develop an application programmer interface (API) and first implementation of a segmentation and registration toolkit, subsequently named the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The original awards included six contractors: GE Global Research, Insightful, Inc., Kitware, Inc., the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Tennessee. The six contractors were partnered with five subcontractors: Harvard University Medical School, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh, Columbia University, and the University of Utah. The period of performance for the original ITK awards began in 1999 and ended in 2003.<br /><br />The resulting system was originally intended for computer-assisted exploration of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Visible Human (VHP) Male and Female data sets. The final deliverable for this group was an open-source software library concentrating on segmentation and registration algorithms, directly released to the public that now helps support research worldwide in image analysis and in other domains.<br />In 2002 and later in 2004, NLM funded outreach efforts known as the program for "ITK Algorithms, Adapters, and Data Distribution" (ITK-A2D2). These programs promoted ITK, tested the ITK API, evaluated the coverage of the algorithm collection, and explored the versatility of the software architecture. In the past, twenty separate awards were made including funding for:<br /><br />Kitware, Inc. Ken Martin, P.I.<br />Application of Segmentation and Registration Techniques to Volume Visualization<br /><br />Georgetown Univ., Kevin Cleary, P.I.<br />Integrating ITK Segmentation Components into an Existing Software Application for RF Ablation Treatment Planning<br /><br />Mayo Clinic, Rich Robb, P.I.<br />Interface for Direct and Seamless Use of ITK with Analyze and AVW<br /><br />Cognita, Corp., Dan Fritsch, P.I.<br />Integrating the SNAP (Snake Automatic Partitioning) Segmentation Tool with the NLM Insight Toolkit<br /><br />Imperial College of London, Derek Hill, P.I.<br />2D-3D Registration Software for X-ray-to-CT Alignment to the Visible Human Insight Toolkit <br /><br />Univ. of Iowa, Vincent Magnotta, P.I.<br />Images, Landmarks, and ROIs<br /><br />Univ. of Utah, Yarden Livnat, P.I.<br />Software Design and Development for Integration of the Insight Toolkit and the SCIRun Problem Solving Environment<br /><br />Insightful, Inc., Lydia Ng, P.I.<br />Shape-based Level Set Segmentation<br /><br />Univ. of Pittsburgh, George Stetten, P.I.<br />Real Time 3D Echocardiographic Data with Semi-Automated Boundary Tracking Algorithms<br /><br />Harvard BWH Surgical Planning Laboratory, C.F.

Revising ITK is considered a contribution to the nation's infrastructure through software. Careful thought has been placed on the cultivation and maintenance of this software, assuring developers that the software will remain supported with new releases, bug fixes, and continuing growth. <br />B. A general description of the required objectives and desired results<br />The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is currently available with the release, ITK version 3.16, announced in September 2009 (see the URL: http://www.itk.org). NLM is funding a major revision, ITK-v4, and we are seeking to exercise the new version through a series of 1-year awards to both broaden the user base and evaluate how the new software version performs.<br />The current funded effort for revising ITK (ITK-v4) will concentrate on four (4) areas:<br />1. Revise ITK - revise and restructure the toolkit with the intention of providing better organization, testing, and documentation.<br />2. Accelerate ITK - provide abstractions and infrastructure support to leverage emerging computing technologies and prepare the toolkit for use in the next decade.<br />3. Simplify ITK - ease the use of ITK through additional language bindings, better wrapping facilities, and possibly through restructuring of the software architecture.<br />4. Support for DICOM in ITK - update and revise DICOM facilities within ITK.<br />In order to help provide user requirement information during the redesign of ITK and to provide real working tests for the new version, NLM is seeking proposals for:<br />(A) algorithm validation, data collection, and data processing (with a focus on time-varying data applications such as longitudinal data collections on chronic, degenerative diseases) as well as tools for managing public data collections.<br />The validation data component will emphasize the assembling of test data, including implementation of existing statistical methods and generation of ground truth segmentations or collections that capture human variation, provided that all examples, data, and software tools are compatible with the existing ITK software base.<br />AND/OR<br />(B) contract programming that extends ITK through incorporating additional algorithm families not already represented in ITK or projects that incorporate ITK into software and hardware systems in support of clinical or medical research applications (with an emphasis on multidisciplinary, practical applications not yet coverd by ITK such as microscopic image analysis, ultrasonography, video processing, and other topics).<br />AND/OR<br />(C) contract programming to overhaul and upgrade some valuable or necessary existing applications, examples, or algorithm family within ITK with the express purpose of improving compile and performance testing, enabling streaming for large data, out-of-core computing, promoting thread safety and encouraging multithreaded programming, and leveraging ITK hardware acceleration techniques arising from the new revision.<br />Some example concepts for this work include incorporating ITK with:<br />&bull; Algorithms or families of methods not currently represented in ITK<br />&bull; Haptic or graphical visualization and segmentation assistance using ITK<br />&bull; A dashboard for 3D tumor evaluation, comparison, and validation (for example, a regression testing system for comparing ITK algorithms against manual tumor evaluations) providing regression testing and comparison of publicly submitted algorithms<br />&bull; Multiscale genome to physiological expression segmentation and visualization with ITK support.<br />&bull; Large data, out-of-core data processing applications including image analysis for microscopy<br />&bull; An image analysis framework for comparing algorithm performance which might include measure computer-aided diagnosis tools or biomarker evaluation through ROC analysis<br />&bull; Fast interaction techniques for low-latency visualization and segmentation navigation with ITK<br />&bull; Inner and middle ear modeling and segmentation including mechanical and electro-physiology simulation<br />&bull; Public data storage and deposition libraries and their supporting tools and infrastructure<br />&bull; Heart modeling<br />&bull; Tools for interpolating development and growth using time-varying data<br />&bull; A tumor volume measurement workstation with ITK plug-in capabilities<br />&bull; ITK supportable software for creating PACS research archives with automatic scrubbing and de-identification of patient information across PACS vendors.<br />This is a list of example projects that might be covered under this acquisition. The list is not exhaustive nor does it cover all areas of interest.<br />Multiple awards are expected, and a single group or offeror may receive more than one award for separate and discrete software development proposals. Individual projects are limited to one year in duration and a maximum of $150,000.<br />All deliverables will be released under the existing ITK license as public, open-source software, and so all deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions. The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement.<br />NLM intends to make multiple awards to address these issues. NLM expects the final team to make approximately ten (10) separate awards. The period of performance for these awards is one (1) year.
<p>C. A detailed description of the technical requirements. <br />Integration is considered the key to success for both this contract action as well as the success of the ITK toolkit in general. All offerors should be prepared to work closely with other NLM contractors and with the existing Insight software community. All software deliverables will be checked-in to the current source code control system and vetted through the style checker and regression testing dashboards currently in place.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. As with the VHP data, controlled access to the source code and image processing tools will be through the issuance of no-cost licenses. The licenses are required solely to allow NLM to track the use, distribution, and proliferation of VHP program products. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required.<br />To meet the fairly rigorous demands of this collaborative software development project, in the case of algorithm-contributing contractors and software interface developing contractors, NLM is applying the following technical requirements:<br />&bull; Strong knowledge of C++ object-oriented programming.<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience with existing software either being ported to ITK or being adapted through a system interface.<br />&bull; Commitment to all software and documentation developed under these contracts being made available as open-source material. All software will be released according to the licensing agreements that apply to ITK.<br />&bull; Commitment to developing software or data collections under this contract under the style rules and architectural design of the Insight Toolkit.<br />The NLM encourages relationships between industry and academia in this development process. A FTE commitment for programming staff from each of the parties in the consortium is essential.<br />Since public distribution of all data and software is a fundamental principle of this project, in the case of data-contributing contractors, NLM requires that the contractor demonstrate, through the text of the proposal, a knowledge and understanding of the issues in distributing medical data including: the use of patient release forms for long-term authorization of data distribution; the scrubbing of metadata to protect patient privacy; and the reformatting of datasets to comply with standard forms of data files for use in medical software applications.</p>
<p>D. Subordinate tasks or types of work.<br />1. Attend a contractor meeting. The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical software engineering and development discussion. This meeting will take place from June 28, 2010 until June 30, 2010 at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />2. Develop or modify software for use with ITK exhibiting practical clinical applications of the software or its derivative software engineering tools. Particular emphasis will be placed on clinical relevance or biomedical research, multiscale/multidisciplinary applications, and practical exploration of the uses of ITK.<br />OR</p>
<p>Contribute a dataset or data collection to the ITK distribution system that will enhance or improve the ITK offering by supplementing the software with test data for evaluating, validating, and improving algorithm development. The NLM is placing an emphasis on multiscale, multidisciplinary data (such as sensor data that augments volumetric images) as well as time-varying data from longitudinal studies for clinical trials on chronic degenerative diseases or developmental data associated with neural tract imaging and child development. Another area of interest for NLM is a collection of human datasets that demonstrate normal variation across populations<br />3. If providing software not currently in ITK into the Insight Toolkit software base, the successful award winner must also demonstrate the efficacy of the deliverable by contributing a validation test to ITK. This test should measure how well the software performs its designated tasks and demonstrates the software working with multiple computing platforms. Contractors will contribute all test data and testing and validation software to ITK. <br />OR<br />If contributing datasets or data collections, the successful award winner must take all measures necessary to protect patient privacy and to reformat the data as necessary to comply with the requirements for data distribution under the Visible Human Project. <br />4. Move the developed code or contributed data to a public repository and assure its placement in the public domain.<br />5. Contribute documentation, tutorial materials, and courseware.<br />6. Develop examples of proposed algorithms in ITK or provide renderings of all contributed data.<br />7. Perform all software and documentation development under the style guidelines and architectural rules of the Insight Toolkit.</p>
<p>E. Quality Control.<br />In keeping with the practices for the development of the current Insight Toolkit, all software deliverables will be required to pass through the ITK dashboard, the open-source system for regression testing and quality control. No deliverables will be considered acceptable without checking in the software to the source code repository, and cleared through the dashboard regression testing process. All software, including examples, must be accompanied by software tests, both run-time and regression test, suitable for implementation in the dashboard system. All deliverables must pass their own tests as well as not break other tests in the toolkit.<br />Data deliverables will be checked to make sure that appropriate measures have been taken to protect patient privacy or that necessary releases have been secured in order to distribute the data.<br />Coding style will be checked as a part of the testing process. NLM will create a software editorial committee. Representatives from each of the contracted programming teams will comprise the editorial committee. If an offeror submits a deliverable, the representative from that team will be recused from the editorial evaluation of the deliverable. The remaining committee members will review the deliverable, the software style, documentation, completeness, comprehensiveness and coverage of the software tests, and the correctness of the implementation. Approval of the editorial committee will be required before receiving can be entered for any software deliverable.</p>
<p>F. Reporting Requirements.<br />Progress reports will be requested quarterly, and electronic copies of slides, handouts, or documentation will serve as quarterly reports. Weekly teleconferences, videoconferences, or virtual conferences will be held to provide continuing communication among the project team. Attendance at these weekly meetings is highly recommended. Software deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository and testing of deliverables will be covered in an automatic build and regression testing environment.</p>
<p>H. Period of Performance.<br />The period of performance for this requirement is one (1) year.</p>
<p>I. Deliverables.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. The NLM will use the Visible Human Project rights and data clause with this requirement, claiming ownership of all data and software generated under this requirement, including all source code. NLM intends to place the ITK license on all software and release it in the public domain. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required. All deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository.<br />There will be one attendance deliverable. The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical software engineering and development discussion. This meeting will take place from June 28, 2010 until June 30, 2010 at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>J. Technical Evaluations.<br />Peer review of the proposals will be accomplished by a Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) in compliance with NIH policy and procedure.<br />The technical evaluation criteria to be applied follow. Subcategories of each evaluation criteria carry equal weight. (Total Possible Points - 100)<br /><br />1. Understanding the Requirement and Technical Approach (scientific, technical, or analytical approach to achieve project objectives, including a demonstrated understanding of potential problems. <br />(35 Points)<br />The proposal must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Objectives and Research Requirements and describes an approach that will demonstrate the achievement of timely and acceptable performance. The proposal presents a comprehensive statement of the problem, scope, and purpose of the project to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements from a management and technical standpoint.<br />The proposal should describe:<br />(1) a pre-existing algorithm or set of algorithms to be added to ITK;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>(2) a collection of relevant data and the analysis of that data to be added to the test and validation collection in ITK;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>(3) documented development of a software system such as software for medical visualization, simulation, treatment planning, computer-aided diagnosis, or microscopic image analysis.</p>
<p>The proposal should describe how ITK and the software system should be integrated.</p>
<p>Specifically the proposal must demonstrate:</p>
<p>(a) Relevance of the proposed application area to the specific areas of interest outlined in the Statement of Objectives and Research Requirements, including the emphasis of the solicitation on 3D (or higher dimensional) algorithms or data suitable for algorithm validation.</p>
<p>(b) The importance of the proposed application area, that is, the potential for its use as part of the Visible Human Project Insight Toolkit. Importance will be judged on the contribution of the datasets, the algorithms, or system interfaces to the broadening of the community of ITK users. Classes of algorithms that are already represented in ITK will be scored lower than methods that are not currently covered by the toolkit. Importance of data collections will be evaluated on the breadth of the datasets proposed for distribution with ITK, the number of datasets and relevance of that data to the medical community. Comprehensive data collections will be preferred over single, unique, specialty datasets. Proposed system interfaces to software products will be evaluated on the perceived impact of ITK on that system, and the relative benefit to the Insight project. Interfacing ITK to software packages with established user communities will help</p>
<p>(c) amplify the contribution of the Insight project among researchers in medical image analysis. Proposals should describe the expected impact of their contribution both to the intended user group, and the concomitant benefit to the Visible Human Project Insight Toolkit.</p>
<p>(d) The demonstrated level of understanding of the image understanding issues and problems related to the proposed application as they pertain to the analysis and processing of medical images.</p>
<p>(e) The demonstrated level of understanding of the software development issues and problems associated with distributed code development among a consortium of programming teams; OR a demonstrated level of understanding of the data distribution issues and problems associated with the dissemination of biomedical data including privacy protection, licensing, copyright protection, and patient consent.</p>
<p>2. Qualifications and Availability of Proposed Personnel (demonstrated evidence of the qualifications, experience, and availability of professional and technical personnel comprising the necessary project staff.)(40 Points)</p>
<p>The proposal must demonstrate and document the relevant expertise, education, availability, and experience of the proposed personnel to be assigned and available for work under the project. Specifically, the proposal must demonstrate and document:</p>
<p>(a) Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in software engineering for revising open source software.</p>
<p>(b) Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the design and implementation of C++ object oriented programming.</p>

<p>3. Institutional Experience/Commitment (Commitment to open-source software and open science: a clear understanding and support from the institution that all deliverables will be part of the Insight Toolkit, that all deliverables will be released in the public domain as open source software, that no limitations will be placed on the intellectual property associated with any deliverables, and that the final deliverables will be released under the ITK license)(15 Points)</p>
<p>The proposal must demonstrate and document the degree of commitment of the various entities involved in the proposed software development process and the commitment to distributing the product code and related deliverables in source-code form under the ITK license.<br />Support of this experience and commitment should be expressed through (a) documentation of previous releases of ITK software, (b) a letter of support from the offeror's Dean or Chief Operating Officer or similar official stating the offeror's commitment to releasing patent privileges and copyrights of work performed under this requirement to the public domain, and/or (c) the text of the copyright or license, documented or clearly cited for its source, used by the offeror in previous releases of open source software and/or public domain data.</p>
<p>4. Proposed Facilities and Equipment (availability and proposed utilization.)(10 Points)</p>
<p>The contractor should have a demonstrated ongoing active research interest and an in-house program in clinical or biomedical information processing or the use of medical computing in health services research. This requirement is necessary to ensure the contractor has the established background and knowledge required to make practical advances in these complex areas of research. NLM wishes to establish relationships with institutions or organizations that have independent/complementary research interests to ensure continued development towards the eventual goal of comprehensive algorithm coverage in ITK. <br />The contractor should also have access to members of the principal user groups for which ITK is intended (i.e., computer software designers and toolbuilders for health sciences practitioners, educators, health services researchers, biomedical researchers) who can be used to test the effectiveness of the structures and models developed.<br />The proposal must describe the availability and proposed utilization of appropriate facilities and equipment required to successfully perform work in the proposed application area. This includes access to source data and validation instrumentation.<br />5. Past Performance<br />Past performance - a past performance evaluation will be performed as part of the review (by the Project Officer/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, NOT by the technical evaluation committee, so no points are indicated in the technical evaluation). The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the government.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance should include previous experience with Grants and other assistance vehicles as well as with previous contracts. Grants and contracts arising from other agencies such as DARPA and NSF will likely be part of the histories and should be evaluated without prejudice.<br />K.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Purchase Request Number: F3W4010071AQ01 Request for Proposal. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>**************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability<br />requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>A copy of the company's business license(s) and a narrative summarizing the company's experience with similar work are required to be submitted with the proposal. The narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Also, one of the following documents are required: a Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>2) Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>--Business License(s): Business licenses submitted will be evaluated to determine if the contractor has authority to perform in Germany.</p>
<p>--A Meisterbrief or an ISO 9001 or 9002 certificate: Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>--A narrative summarizing company's experience with similar work. Narrative must include statement of understanding regarding the Government's requirement to be provided with the HVAC and electrical certificates for technicians prior to the performance of such work. Documentation will be reviewed to determine relevant experience.</p>
<p>3) By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>4) Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding<br />contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause)</p>
<p>52.212-4 - CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2009)</p>

<DESC><p>**This notice revision is a follow-on request for Statements of Capability to the original posting in December 2007. Please read below for further guidance.**</p>
<p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire sustainment for the current EPOCH based (http://www.integ.com/Products.html) Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) and to extend the system to support new satellites and architecture upgrades. The CCS-C Block II contract will provide Air Force Space Command telemetry, tracking and commanding functionality in support of current and future MILSATCOM satellite operations for the period FY12 - FY22. During this period, the CCS-C Block II system must comply with evolving Information Assurance requirements and spacecraft and operator needs. CCS-C Block II training products will be developed in compliance with the AFSPC Standard Space Trainer architecture. CCS-C Block II capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interoperability with dedicated ground and payload control systems. Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include: launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations. Future migration to Unified S-Band (USB) waveforms and data formats shall be supported. Contractor must be able to sustain current CCS-C hardware, software, databases, command procedures and Technical Orders. System upgrades to address Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated. Contractor must demonstrate a transparent process/capability that develops, tests, installs and transitions new software and hardware to operations with near-zero system regressions. The contractor will demonstrate a robust system deficiency (problem resolution) capability resulting in negligible CCS-C Block II deficiency backlog and expeditious operator system complaint resolution. The contractor will report performance using the earned value management system and have approved business systems, including cost reporting, purchasing, and accounting systems.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in July 2012 lasting through FY22. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 6721 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046. The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2011. On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA. A minimum Department of Defense (DoD) security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating expertise and capability in satellite command and control hardware and software design and test procedures by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday,&nbsp;31 March 2010. The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan. The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates. Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also is available upon request from the contracting officer, Capt Peterson. If your company previously submitted a SOC in response to the original posting and the SOC is adequate, no further submission is required. However, please communicate with the contact listed below to express continued interest in this potential acquisition.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length. This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format. All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other than the incumbent exists. Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Capt Andrew Peterson, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and may be submitted to andrew.peterson@losangeles.af.mil and brian.paschall.ctr@losangeles.af.mil. Inquiries may be directed to Capt Peterson at 310-653-9583 or Mr. Brian Paschall at 310-653-9722.</p>

The contractor will report performance using the earned value management system and have approved business systems, including cost reporting, purchasing, and accounting systems.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in July 2012 lasting through FY22. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 6721 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046. The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2011. On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA. A minimum Department of Defense (DoD) security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating expertise and capability in satellite command and control hardware and software design and test procedures by 4:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday,&nbsp;31 March 2010. The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan. The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates. Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also is available upon request from the contracting officer, Capt Peterson. If your company previously submitted a SOC in response to the original posting and the SOC is adequate, no further submission is required. However, please communicate with the contact listed below to express continued interest in this potential acquisition.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length. This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format. All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other than the incumbent exists. Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Capt Andrew Peterson, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is mandated to catalog its serials and to make this cataloging available to the biomedical library community in NLM Locatorplus, NLM's online public access catalog and the NLM Catalog under Entrez, both available via the Internet. NLM is also responsible for distributing the bibliographic records to other bibliographic utilities and library service agencies. As a CONSER participant, NLM shares in the cooperative cataloging and updating of serial records on the OCLC WorldCAT (OCLC) database. NLM has an inventory of over 290 serials titles in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish on preservation microfilm in the General Collection.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) issued a Prospectus soliciting proposals for a Concession Contract to provide overnight lodging, food and beverage, retail, marinas, and camping at the Signal Mountain Lodge Area and Leeks Marina in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming on February 9, 2010. The Prospectus explains the business opportunity and the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the Concession Contract.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR, Part 51, has determined that the existing Concessioner is not a preferred offeror for the Contract.
A one-day site visit occurred on October 7, 2008. At that time, an overview of the Area was provided by NPS personnel, along with a tour of existing concession facilities associated with this Draft Contract.  A second site visit will be held Wednesday, April 21, 2010, in order to allow interested parties an opportunity to see the facilities. Attendance at the site visit is not required in order to submit a proposal for the Prospectus.  
The site visit will begin at 9:00 a.m. in front of Signal Mountain Lodge in Grand Teton National Park. Parties interested in attending the site visit must register with Dick Swihart at (307) 739-3417 or email Dick_Swihart@nps.gov by the close of business on Friday, April 9, 2010.  Party size will be limited to four (4) individuals per organization to help manage the overall size of the tour.
Questions specific to the Prospectus will not be entertained during or after the site visit as the deadline for questions will have already closed.

The NL/TLMS, which was designed and developed by CSI, is a 40 mm, three bank launching system that fires 30 rounds of non-lethal primed munitions. The NL/TLMS will provide the Marine Expeditionary Forces the ability to deliver a high volume of non-lethal fire at designated ranges, both day and night, to enhance force protection at Vehicle Check Points (VCP) and during convoy security operations.  The Government does not have any intellectual property rights in the NL/TLMS, or a technical data package that would permit the procurement of the NL/TLMS through full and open competition.   Award to another source would require it to duplicate the engineering details of the NL/TLMS, which in turn would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.  Furthermore, award to another source would result in additional unacceptable delays associated with testing and certification, which is required to be performed prior to the fielding and deployment of any other NL/TMS system.  Approximate award date is February 2010.  This is not a formal solicitation; furthermore, this synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any responsible source that possesses the capability to provide the NL/TMS as described above may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address: lawrence.hubbard.ctr@usmc.mil and copy to patsy.d.stefan@usmc.mil.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email also to Mr. Larry Hubbard at lawrence.hubbard.ctr@usmc.mil and copy to patsy.d.stefan@usmc.mil.  The date and time of closing is Wednesday, 03 September 2009, 4:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).  The synopsis number is M67854-09-R-1049.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs Supply (Value) Chain Transformation ProgramNotice Type:  Sources SoughtThe proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (as defined in FAR 15.201(e)), this is not a solicitation. Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates and manages procurement systems responsible for the procurement of approximately $34 billion in goods and services per year. Currently the VA's enterprise information systems and process are outdated and are not able to efficiently manage current procurement demand. The VA is therefore requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting healthcare supply chain management contractors to provide integrated enterprise supply (value) chain management support services to the VA. These services will support and increase the efficiency of current VA enterprise supply chain management systems. The VA requires procurement information systems that provide purchasing information in near real time. These data systems should be capable of capturing and displaying the analytics required for informed decision making at key VA organization levels. Key VA organization levels include (but are not limited to VA Medical Centers (VAMC), Veteran Integrated Services Networks (VISN), Regional/National Acquisition Centers, VA Health Administration (VHA) and the VA Central Office (VACO).The contractor would conduct a VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Assessment for the purposes of identification and documentation of performance improvements and increased procurement system effectiveness. The assessment will include a recommendation for the professional services, information systems and any associated tools required to support VA Enterprise purchasing management. The contractor would focus its evaluation on the VHA procurement program for Medical Surgical and Prosthetics Equipment. Upon VA approval of the assessment the contractor may be tasked to execute the recommendation. If a material solution is implemented the contractor may be tasked to provide the professional services required to operate the material solution in support of VA procurement staff. The VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Assessment is important so that all areas of potential non-compliance are identified, documented, and priced. The contractors' implementation methodology will provide best industry practices for the following services:(a) A recommendation for the most efficient organization and methodology for the operation of the VA Medical Surgical products and Prosthetics devices supply chains.	(b) A recommendation for world class transformation methodologies, including but not limited to, the equipment, software, firmware and hardware required to facilitate VA enterprise supply chain management.	(c) A recommendation for the Professional enterprise supply chain management "back office" support.	(d) A recommendation for providing data analytics of VA enterprise procurement data.	(e) A recommendation for the methodology for conducting product and data standardization.	(f) A recommendation for establishing, updating and optimize the VA's E-Catalog.	To execute the above services, the contractor would perform the following activities:(a) The contractor would review current VA Policy and Handbooks concerning the procurement of Medical Surgical and Prosthetics Commodities. Review VHA Handbooks 1173.1 through 1173.15 and 1173.17 (Prosthetics and Sensory Aid Service policy), VHA directives 1660.1 and 1660.3), VA Directive 7002 (Logistics Management Policy) and VA Directive 1663 (Health Care Resources Contracting - Buying Title 38 U.S.C. 8153). The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved Enterprise procurement business rules that could be programmed into the VA procurement system software that will provide improved procurement compliance.	(b) The contractor would review VA enterprise compliance with VHA Directive 2006-029 ensuring accurate prosthetics data entry throughout the enterprise for prosthetics orders into the National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD), i.e. surgical implants, audiology, etc.; ensuring appropriate use of prosthetics cost centers and budget object codes; and managing inventory through the Prosthetics Inventory Package (PIP) to maximize appropriate resource utilization. (See note at end of #5.).	(c) The contractor would review the current VA medical surgical and prosthetics commodities data identification standards, including the National Item File. The contractor would recommend a process for data standardization to enhance the appropriate capture, use and dissemination of procurement data.(d) The contractor would review current process for the prosthetics organizational functions within the VISN including use of mandatory contracts and contract development. The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved procurement system rules that could be programmed into the VA procurement systems software that will provide improved procurement compliance including providing near real time data capture to provide a basis for data analytics.(e) The contractor would review VA Prosthetics and Orthotic Laboratory/Services including inventory, workload capture, and relationships with other clinical services, determination of consistent compliance with forwarding all contractor quotes to a certified Prosthetist/Orthotist for review to ensure accurate invoicing. The contractor would develop a recommendation for improved business rules that will provide for improved compliance including providing near real time data capture to provide a basis for data analytics. The contractor would also develop and provide recommendations for the development of process metrics and compliance management techniques.(f) The contractor would review the current process for enterprise supply chain management and develop a recommendation for the professional services and equipment (if any) required to establish a centralized data warehouse that will provide the data required to perform procurement data analysis at the VA Medical Center, Veteran Integrated Service network (VISN), region, VA Administration and Central Office levels. The Data Warehouse must capture information from current VA databases and provide a platform for data analytics. The contractor would create enterprise procurement dashboards that can be displayed at procurement analysts' work stations.(g) The contractor would review the current VA E-Catalog, and develop a recommendation for update, upgrade and methods for automated maintenance and utilization of a new VA E-Catalog capability.(h) The contractor would review VA processes for clinical product standardization. The contractor shall recommend policy and practice updates that can be integrated into the enterprise supply chain to introduce greater efficiency into both the product standardization process and the procurement process for those systems.(i) The contractor would review competency assessments, training, and education, for essential areas such as procurement, inventory management, consult management, and other compliance areas for enterprise procurement and clinical staff.(j) The contractor would review VISN-wide training plans and evaluate plan effectiveness, its effectiveness and oversight.As stated above, The VA may also request the contractor to implement all approved recommendations resulting from their initial review and assessment of current VA operations and practices. Upon successful implementation the VA may also request that the contractor support the operation of the new systems to support VA enterprise procurement operations. It is anticipated that only contractors with current commercially available or adaptable systems will be eligible for this effort. Contractor recommendations based on the use of proprietary equipment, systems and processes shall be identified as such.The VA is in the process of planning a market research conference in Crystal City, Virginia April 20-21, 2010. The conference will discuss the VA's requirement for these services. The conference will give contractors the opportunity to present their latest approaches to Enterprise Healthcare Supply (Value) Chain Management. More details about the market research conference will be posted via an amendment to this RFI as they become available.Submit expressions of interest electronically in Microsoft Word format (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font minimum) to include documentation of corporate capabilities in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary expertise and experience in analysis, evaluation and implementation which would be utilized to improve the VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Management. In addition, submit any lessons learned and best commercial practices that would be utilized for the VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Management requirement.Since this is a Sources Sought Announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants. This announcement is not a solicitation and does not bind the Government to award any contract. No solicitations exist at this time. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.

<DESC>THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) AWARDED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ANDREINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERING SUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THEPREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITH ASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION.&lt;P&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts under the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). NASAs Aeronautics Research Program willaccelerate key research  in aircraft icing and enhance aviation safety by developingtools and methods for improved safety of materials, flight controls, and flight criticalsystems operating in the future through its Aviation Safety Program.  This task willprovide the design of test hardware that will be used in support of testing to validateand verify advanced control methods that effectively mitigate the adverse effects ofaircraft icing.&lt;P&gt;NASA GRC has issued a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to procureengineering services to support the design efforts for artificial ice shapes to be usedin a wind tunnel test to determine aerodynamic effects of ice accreted on an aircraftmodel. Aerodynamics is the motion of air as it interacts with an aircraft in flight. Toobtain the iced-aircraft aerodynamics for the simulations, a plan has been developed toconduct wind tunnel experiments using a subscale model aircraft appropriately fitted withartificial ice shapes. These artificial ice shapes must be expertly designed, built,attached to the subscale model aircraft, and verified. Ice accumulated on an aircraftduring flight through clouds at certain conditions disrupts the air flow around theaircraft. This task will require the design of artificial ice shapes for the leadingedges of the main wings, the horizontal tailplane, and the vertical tailplane.	&lt;P&gt;THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. &lt;P&gt;A CPAF order is appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.
