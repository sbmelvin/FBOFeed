<DESC>The US Army Contracting Center - Aberdeen Proving Grounds Belvoir Division  on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Science and Technology Division (STD) is conducting research to identify state of the art technology, within industry and academia, in explosive hazard (to include landmines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and Unexploded Ordinance (UXO)) detection algorithm techniques for use in a handheld explosive hazard detection field data acquisition system.  The detection algorithms would be expected to assist detection of explosive hazard targets buried from 0 - 30 cm deep and from distances as far as 7.5 cm above the ground.   The algorithms will need to operate on the output of one or more sensor technologies.   The sensor technologies include advanced ground penetrating radar, advanced metal detection sensors, magnetometers, and electro-optic cameras.  All components of the multi-sensor explosive hazard field data collection detection system will be attached to a wand configuration that will be swept over the ground. Sensor head position tracking (Global Positioning System, Inertial Mapping Unit, and Inertial Navigation System) information will be available for integration into the candidate explosive hazard detection algorithms.  Eventually, the detection algorithm technology would be expected to provide user feedback in real time.  The detection algorithms are expected to result in high detection probability and low false alarm rate.  Respondents are asked to submit a white paper on or before close of business on 15 October 2012, of no more than 10 pages in length, describing the realistic application of their approach using sound scientific theory.   Papers should also include point(s) of contact for further Government inquiry should more information be desired.

Enhanced Caregiver Training Resources for Family Caregivers
 Statement of Work

Providing enhanced caregiver training resources for family caregivers through Respite Care, Companion Care, Respite-Skilled Care, Family Respite Care away from home, Caregiver Career Coaching (earning money in their current situation), Activities and Events for National Caregiver Month, Integrated Medicine for Caregivers, Mindfulness training, Behavioral health modification training, Training on way to manage caregiver burn-out, Nutrition training (healthy lifestyle with a busy lifestyle), and Support for the children of caregivers such as workshops and seminars on ways to assist the children to understand better.

Location: 50 Irving St. NW Washington, DC 20422

History

Family caregivers play an essential role in caring for Veterans who are homebound, either as a result of a serious physical injury or mental illness incurred through military combat, or another serious illness which requires care in the home. Clinical simulation training modules have been previously developed using commercially available software, have proven effective in training caregivers, and represent a low cost, high impact opportunity to improve the home care provided to Veterans Home caregivers typically receive some training at discharge or by a nurse during a home visit, however, once in the home alone, the caregiver has limited access to support in performing the task independently. The VA, with the support of Congress, has been making significant progress in strengthening support services to family caregivers.

Objective

The objective of this statement of work is for family caregivers to have the opportunity to engage in practical, interactive, hands-on demonstrations of basic clinical procedures and competencies learned earlier. They will be able to practice these basic clinical procedures and skills in a safe environment, using realistic, practical, scenarios, so that they have the confidence to administer care to their Veteran. This simulation will provide a safe and consequence-free environment to practice these skills using simulated patient scenarios.

This statement of work proposes to use CliniSpace Virtual Worlds software and a series of previously-developed basic clinical procedures (scenarios) to immerse caregivers in an authentic, three-dimensional, virtual scenario that replicates the patient and the clinical procedure being performed.



The four training areas for development under this Statement of Work will include:

"	A formal instruction in the procedure.

"	Watch a demonstration of the procedure.
"	Practice the procedure using a realistic scenario.
"	Develop confidence and skills in performing the procedure. 
Training will allow for review and evaluation by the caregiver to test their knowledge after completion of simulations and determine the need for further training and practice

Note:

Caregivers are allowed to repeat / re-do situations to improve performance based on virtual feedback until they have developed the confidence to administer care to the Veteran.

Scope

The contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, materials, equipment and supplies, not otherwise provided by the Government, to perform the work required as set forth herein.  Travel reimbursements for meeting participants and meeting facilities will be provided by the government.

Performance on this Statement of Work (SOW) will be monitored by DC VAMC to ensure satisfactory performance.  It is expected that the contractor will communicate and meet with the government COTR as necessary, including a kick-off meeting within one week of contract award, to ensure an effective planning process.  

Type of Contract

The contract shall be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with both firm fixed price task orders (tasks 1, and 2) and time and material task orders (task 3).  This allows for flexibility and responsive performance to meet the rapidly changing and demanding requirements of the DC VAMC.  

Contractor requirements include:  (1) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB); (2) contractor to have staff within five miles of the DC VAMC to allow for frequent meetings and onsite support during the period of performance; (3) contractor with significant experience and past performance with the VA Central Office, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) offices, and leadership at the VAMC level; (4) contractor with extensive corporate and management team experience with planning, developing content, and providing logistical support for VA advisory committee meetings, seminars, and educational symposia; (5) contractor with experience developing programs in collaboration with the VA Employee Education System (EES); and (6) expertise, access, and ability to apply medical algorithms related to patent application 2009/0132460A1.

Performance

Period of performance shall be within 30 days of obligation. Meetings, seminars, and presentations to stakeholders will take place.  Sign up team will be established within 60days. 

Note: Existing course training and workshop content will consist of

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>Question:<br />Why did the Contracting Officer decide to post this requirement as an Unrestricted Acquisition?
<p>Answer:<br />This acquisition has several issues that drove the decision to not set this aside for small business. The biggest factor was the applicability of the Non-Manufacturer Rule. The Contracting Officer, in coordination with Air Combat Command Contracting and the Small Business Administration made the determination that this requirement should be solicited under NAICS 332510, which is a manufacturing NAICS code. The Non-manufacturer Rule states a firm that receives a supply contract under a small business set aside they MUST be either a manufacturer of a small business product or must agree to supply the product of a domestic small manufacturer or processor if not the manufacturer themselves. Since this contract encompasses such a vast variety of supplies, it is not feasible for a single small business to manufacture or provide items manufactured by other small businesses to meet all of the requirements under this acquisition. Therefore, the decision was made to post this requirement as an Unrestricted acquisition.</p>

<DESC>Interested parties please provide the following:<br />1. Review and Comment on Draft Solicitation<br />2. Review and Comment of Solicitation CLINS/Bid Schedule<br />3. Review and Comment of Alternate CLINS/Bid Schedule<br />4. Respond, citing references when possible, to Government Proposed Questions
<p>Note that we may not respond to questions as we are developing our acquisition, however, please feel free to ask them as it provides us insight to concerns to be addressed. Your participation is critical to enhancing this acquisition and we sincerely thank you for your time.</p>
Industry Feedback
<p>This is a request for information. This is not a solicitation. No proposals are requested or will be accepted based on this posting.</p>
<p>In an attempt to better develop our solicitation we are providing a draft and the following questions to partner with industry on developing the best acquisition possible for the United States Air Force. Ultimately it is the USAF's determination how the final solicitation will be structured, which may or may not include input from the responses of industry. At this time we do not intend to answer questions, however, asking questions is not prohibited as we will use them to understand your concerns.</p>
<p>1. Please review entire solicitation, including the Statement of Work, and provide feedback for suggestions and improvement or identify confusing language. Please provide Document Title, Page Number, and if possible, paragraph number to assist in our identifying and understanding your reference.</p>
<p>2. Request review of CLINS/Bid Schedule on draft solicitation and compare to the Alternate bid schedule and provide merits/disadvantages of each?</p>
<p>3. CLIN X002 in the Alternate Bid Schedule, if we make this firm fixed priced for general operation of the COCESS store on Seymour-Johnson, removing risk from a contractor, would this substantially lower the pricing of the products (mark-ups) purchased under CLIN 0001?</p>
<p>4. The SOW para 1.5.1.20 requires "the ability to provide the government the actual price paid by the contractor backed up by the actual vendor invoices." Would there be any additional cost associated with providing this data? If so, what?</p>
<p>4a. How would you structure the CLINS to alleviate the need for this information and rely on comparison to other industry providers?</p>
<p>4b. Is this a normal Commercial Practice?</p>
<p>5. Draft evaluation factors are included; please provide feedback and constructive rationale for making any changes?</p>
<p>6. Is any information missing that would be beneficial to providing a bid, removing risk and/or assist in the Government receiving a lower price?</p>
<p>7. Once the solicitation is released, how many days would you need to provide a proposal?</p>
<p>8. If you're a large business, what area's and what percentage of the contract is it feasible to subcontract to Small Business?</p>

This is a Presolicitation Notice. This Notice is being issued for planning and informational purposes only. This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.<br><br>A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length. <br><br>The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br>Roadway construction, including overpass<br>Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br>Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br>Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br>Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br>Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br>Signs and pavement marking<br>Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br>Signalization, as determined by a study<br><br>Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.<br><br>This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br><br>NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000. <br><br>PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS: Offerors will be invited to submit a proposal subject to Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both.

Offers must have their Reps and Certs available on-line in ORCA, https://orca.bpn.gov, prior to receiving a Government contract award.<br><br>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Specific information pertaining to this procurement will be available in the solicitation.

<DESC>The NEC intends to purchase new Storage Area Network hardware to replace end of life SAN hardware.  The requirement is to acquire the new storage to allow the RIA NEC to maintain these 98% reliability and 20% free space.  The current SAN will be unable to maintain this and support future growth.  Without the requested hardware the ability to support the application on aging hardware will be impossible.  The current SAN are reaching a point where there will be no support for them.  Also, the likelihood that critical storage will fail becomes greater due to the fact that the SAN drives are active for life of the hardware.  We intend to purchase the required support by awarding a competitive firm fixed price delivery order through the Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) program which is the Army's designated primary source for commercial IT. In accordance with the CHESS ordering guidelines, the Fair Opportunity will be given to all six ITES-2H multiple award contract holders. A brand name justification has been approved and is being posted with this announcement.

<DESC>The NEC intends to purchase new Storage Area Network hardware to replace end of life SAN hardware.  The requirement is to acquire the new storage to allow the RIA NEC to maintain these 98% reliability and 20% free space.  The current SAN will be unable to maintain this and support future growth.  Without the requested hardware the ability to support the application on aging hardware will be impossible.  The current SAN are reaching a point where there will be no support for them.  Also, the likelihood that critical storage will fail becomes greater due to the fact that the SAN drives are active for life of the hardware.  We intend to purchase the required support by awarding a competitive firm fixed price delivery order through the Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) program which is the Army's designated primary source for commercial IT. In accordance with the CHESS ordering guidelines, the Fair Opportunity will be given to all six ITES-2H multiple award contract holders.
