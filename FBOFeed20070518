<DESC>This notice is NOT a Solicitation.  (It is anticipated that a Solicitation for this procurement will be published separately HEREAFTER in this same FedBizOpps website.)   As of the date of the posting of this notice to FedBizOpps, the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) had not yet issued, to the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), an Acceptance Letter for this procurement.  Accordingly, all of the statements made in the remainder of this notice are being made SUBJECT TO the issuance of an Acceptance Letter, by SBA, for this procurement.  Subject to SBA?s anticipated issuance of an Acceptance Letter, this will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside procurement.  Subject to SBA?s anticipated issuance of an Acceptance Letter, the National Industrial Classification System  (NAICS) code for this procurement will be 541611 (?Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services?), which has a size-standard of $6,500,000.   It is anticipated that the Solicitation will reserve DOT?s right to award one, or more than one, 8(a) contract from this procurement.   Each contract awarded from this procurement will be an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract, which will have a Period of Performance of five years, with no option years.  It is anticipated that that each contract will reserve DOT?s right to award any particular Task Order as a fixed-price task order or as a cost-plus-fixed-fee task order or as a time-and-materials task order or as a labor-hour task order.  In other words, it is envisioned that each contract will be a HYBRID contract.  The INCUMBENT 8(a) contractor is MacroSys Research and Technology, located at Suite 312, 888  17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20006-3324.  The incumbent contractor is eligible to compete under the procurement here synopsized.  The INCUMBENT 8(a) contractor?s points of contact are:  Mr. Charles Han, at e-mail address Charlie.han@dot.gov, and Mr. Vincent Fang, at e-mail address Vincent.fang@macrosysrt.com .  The identifying number of MacroSys? incumbent contract (a Task Order contract) is DTTS59-02-D-00463.  The value of the Task Orders that have been issued thus far under that INCUMBENT contract has been approximately fifteen million dollars to twenty million dollars.  That INCUMBENT contract?s Period of Performance is CURRENTLY scheduled to end on August 28, 2007, but there is a POSSIBILITY that DOT MAY hereafter need to extend that incumbent contract for a few months beyond August 28th , especially if this NEW procurement does not produce a new contract by August 28th.   Notwithstanding the existence of the incumbent 8(a) contractor, DOT does emphatically want 8(a) COMPETITION under the procurement here synopsized.   Under the NEW contract resulting from the procurement here synopsized, it is anticipated that the contractor or contractors will provide, to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) within DOT?s Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), support services and assistance for developing data and analyses and related reports, including other information that will assist BTS in its overall mission to obtain and objectively interpret and manage transportation data.  That includes development and maintenance of database systems to allow for data collection and analyses, conducting transportation studies, research, and statistical system design.  It also includes development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications, geospatial data and web mapping services.  In general, the contractor or contractors will assist the agency in performing its day-to-day operations related to these areas and the agency?s premier transportation programs.  The BTS, specifically, as a statistical agency within RITA, compiles, analyzes, and publishes data and information needed for transportation decision-makers, and it manages the National Transportation Library (NTL) and the Office of Airline Information.  It is anticipated that the task  ORDERS issued under the new contract(s) will be issued under the following TASKS:  Research, Technical, and Analytical Support; Transborder Freight Data Programming, Processing, and Analysis; North American Transportation Statistics and Trade Data Analysis; Close Calls Reporting Systems; Global Trade and Transportation Research; U.S. International Trade Data Processing and Analysis;  U. S.

To: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION, SAINT LOUIS, MO., 63134-0000. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The requirements of FAR 9.202(A) have been completed and copies of the qualification requirements and standards may be obtained as described in this solicitation. Sources must be qualified prior to being considered for award.  The solicitation will contain instructions of obtaining further information on this requirement. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering  agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements is cited in each individual solicitation.

Potential bidders would be expected to have the hardware EMI/EMC/environmentally tested and qualified, AIMS Certified, and integrated with stand-alone/appliqu crypto at the "box" level, and be form, fit, increased function replaceable to the existing AN/APX-103C.  Thus, the effort involved is to produce the AN/UPX-40 while maintaining the form, fit , and increased function compatibilities with existing and future E-3 (Blocks 30/35 and 40/45) aircraft. The Government anticipates releasing a request for Proposal in FY2009 for approximately 40 AN/UPX-40 shipsets, including spares. In order to be considered for this effort, a potential contractor must have familiarity with the AWACS IFF Interrogator System (AN/APX-103C) and its Mission System interface and specification requirements in the E-3 aircraft, it's operation (hardware and software), and the AWACS mission system unique interfaces.  Experience with the NATO AWACS Mode S Interrogator Flight Test Program is highly desirable. The Government is tentatively planning to contract with The Telephonics Corporation in Farmingdale, New York in FY2009 for production of these AN/UPX-40 units.  Under a previous contract, Telephonics had added a Mode 5/S interrogation and reply processing capability to an IFF Bench Test Simulator, used to run acceptance test procedures, and developed a prototype interrogator compatible with the existing AWACS System.  The Government is currently on contract with Telephonics to produce three AN/UPX-40 prototype units which are AIMS certified, environmentally qualified against the AWACS E-3 specifications, and that meet the current Interface Control Drawings and Interface Design Drawings (Envelope Drawings) for the E-3 Block 30/35 and 40/45 configurations. The purpose of this RFI is to identify any interested and qualified sources capable of performing the above efforts.  Interested parties who meet the above criteria should provide their up-to-date products, services, experience, and technical capability needed to accomplish this effort.  Please supply this information either by FAX or e-mail not later than 15JUNE2007 to Mr. James K McKenna, A&AS Contract Support, 781-377-6425, FAX # 781-377-5526, james.mckenna.ctr@hanscom.af.mil.  Please indicate if you are US or foreign-owned and if you are a large or small business.  The Government will evaluate all responses objectively however a determination not to compete this effort, based upon responses received, is at the sole discretion of the Government. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTACTUAL SOLICITATION.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SUBMITTED.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:     The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM), 1800 N Kent Street Suite 1060, Arlington, VA 22209.  The proposed acquisition will be for one base year with four one-year options for technical and administrative support for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) Task Force; to include developing plans to resolve GMDSS implementation problems, facilitating meetings, and supporting development of recommendations for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Subcommittee on Communications, Search and Rescue (COMSAR).  The GMDSS now being implemented by the IMO has charged the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention to provide a major upgrade of maritime safety communications procedures and equipment.  This upgrade will affect not only SOLAS ships over 300 tons, but all users of marine radio services. The GMDSS transition period ended February 1999 with most ships converted, however many shore implementation actions are incomplete. Therefore, the USCG and other government agencies cognizant of this issue have sponsored a National GMDSS Implementation Task Force to facilitate the transition and recommend further action.  The most appropriate North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 813920, Professional Organizations, with a small business size standard not to exceed $6,500,000.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  All capability statements received by 5:00 PM EST on 01 June 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determination whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

To enhance Haitis capacity to undertake an ambitious development plan, the Government of Haiti (GOH) has requested US technical assistance in implementing significant reforms and modernizing state functions based on best practice models.  To assist the GOH in its effort, USAID intends to provide for the services of technical advisors to GOH Ministries and Offices (Ministries of Planning and External Cooperation, Commerce, Education, Agriculture, Justice, Public Works, Womens Affairs, Environment, Finance, the Investment Facilitation Center, the Prime Ministers Office, et al) under an Advisory and Assistance Services contract that will expand US support over the next three years (2007 / 2010), helping to strengthen GOH institutions and to ensure that the USG and other donor investments continue to achieve their full potential while instilling best practices in the institutions supported.  The successful contractor will work with the GOH Ministry of Plan and External Cooperation and USAID/Haiti to determine the placement of advisors based on a needs assessment or in response to a request for technical assistance.  This is a three-year activity, including one base year and two option years.
This requirement will be subject to full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.) and the cooperating country.  Total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be 1,272 person months over a 3 year period (one base year and two option years).  USAID strongly encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small businesses in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with FAR Part 19.

USAID anticipates the award of a single contract with a three year period of performance (including options).  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium.  Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060
<RESPDATE>063007

<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

The anticipated release date of the RFP is the week of 30 June 2007. Upon formal release of the RFP, interested parties will be able to view/download the RFP (N00019-07-R-0060) which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.     

In addition to making the solicitation available for downloading via the Internet site, this office will also attempt to E-mail a notification of release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to all prospective offerors that submit a request to register for this information via E-mail. E-mail requests should be sent to the following address: Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil and should include the following information for the purpose of compiling a Bidders Mailing List: 1. Company Name 2. Company Address 3. Point-of-contact, telephone number, fax number and E-mail address. In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to use the Internet for the purpose of submitting requests relative to this solicitation. Telephone requests for the solicitation will neither be accepted nor returned. A paper copy of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available or issued. 

NOTE:     Contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.   

All Discussions, Comments, Or Questions relative to the the MFOQA Solicitation must be addressed directly to the Contracts office.

The Navy Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC) is tasked to develop and maintain these systems.  The NCFMIS does not readily support interfaces with the evolving systems used today by the Navy and DoD.  A project was initiated to replace NCFMIS.  The Navy requires technical support for the transition of SUPMIS functionality and business rules from the Legacy NCFMIS mainframe to the replacement system. The navy intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with WR Systems, Ltd. of Fairfax, Virginia to continue the transition. WR Systems? knowledge and access to Xventory re-engineered software for the replacement system is proprietary in nature and essential to the successful transition to the replacement system. The period of performance is for one year.  Award will be made under simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Parts 12 and 13.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for fabrication of small quantities of both analog and digital integrated circuits.  Using design files supplied by JSC, the contractor must produce and package the integrated circuits in a timely manner (2 months), using a variety of processes and process geometries.  The vendor must be able to convert foundry independent designs to that foundry's native specification.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the MOSIS Division of the University of Southern California because it is a quasi-governmental service set up for this purpose.  MOSIS is a service and uses whatever foundry you specify (from the list they offer).  They convert foundry independent designs to that foundry's native specification.  The time required to convert a design without using MOSIS proprietary software is several months, which is prohibitive.  In addition to the logistics of foundry access, MOSIS supports universal scalable design rules all the way from 1.5 microns to 0.18 microns.  All JSC designs are done using scalable design rules.  The alternative is to do designs using vendor specific design rules.  The labor involved is so great it would prohibit JSC from doing most of its projects. Since scalable design rules depend on unique software processing by MOSIS, this service is not available directly from foundries.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Mary Thomas not later than 2:30 p.m. local time on 5/23/07.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>B -- Identify features of facial and/or respirator variation
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCCLG-2007-43322
<RESPDATE>060207
<ARCHDATE>06182007
<CONTACT>Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (412)386-6431, Fax (412)386-6843, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has a requirement to identify features of facial and /or respirator variation that influence respirator effectiveness using modern methods of biological shape analysis (morphometrics).  Compare identified features to those obtained from traditional measurement protocols and identify, if possible, simple and efficient derived measurements relevant to respirator fitting/efficacy.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) the only known source with unique knowledge of statistical and geometric methods related to the analysis of the coordinates of anatomical landmarks, geometric morphometrics is Dr. Dennis Slice, Ph.D.,Winston-Salem, NC.  

The assessment of respirator efficacy is fairly straightforward through the use of equipment such as the Portacount (TSI, INC.) device that measures the ratio of small particles inside and outside of a mask during operation. More challenging is identifying those aspects of morphological variation that are associated with the performance of a given array of respirators. The standard approach has been through the analysis of the correlation of traditional anthropometric measurements such as facial length, breadth, etc., with measures of respirator fit. In recent years, however, more powerful and efficient morphometric methods have been developed that are based on the analysis of superimposed sets of anatomical landmarks. The Cartesian coordinates of such data concisely encode all of the information from any traditional measurements that could be defined with respect to the same set of anatomical points. In theory, the use of these coordinate-based methods should provide the most comprehensive and powerful approach to relating variation in facial morphology to respirator performance, yet the assessment of these methods for this purpose has only just begun. The current project requires unique knowledge of statistical and geometric methods related to the analysis of the coordinates of anatomical landmarks ? geometric morphometrics.  No solicitation is available; however, interested parties may request a copy of the Statement of Work including deliverables.
Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Margaret L. Mooney, Reference 00HCCLG-2007-43322, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236,  MMooney@cdc.gov.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with Dr. Dennis Slice as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.   Over the past two decades Dr. Slice has been especially known for the development and application of methods and software for geometric morphometrics.  He developed the first widely available and user-friendly software for the application of geometric morphometric methods to three (or higher) dimensional data sets. The program was called GRF-ND, which stood for Generalized Rotational Fitting ? N-Dimensions. The GRF-ND program was superceded in the last decade by his platform-independent program, Morpheus et al., and this software is currently being completely rewritten in Java to take advantage of the language's inherent platform independence and the Java3D visualization tools.  NIOSH intends to use Dr. Slices original software.

This integrated effort is part of a coordinated approach between DLA and the United States Air Force to support the F-15 aircraft with the ultimate goal of increasing the availability of flight hours per aircraft, reducing MICAP hours and life cycle costs for the platform. The number of NSNs for the F-15 Structural Support System is approximately 7,000. An IDIQ with a two year base period and  four two year option periods, for a total of ten years, is anticipated.

The Contractor will provide  worldwide logistics support in the areas of forecasting and asset management. The successful vendor will also provide engineering support services that will provide performance efficiencies for the F-15 Structural Support System via spare parts improvements, improved reliability and aircraft lifespan, management of obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources, improved overall technical and engineering processes, and configuration management. A copy of the solicitation will be available via the following:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>As part of advancing the President's Health Information Technology agenda, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will be soliciting proposals to establish Nationwide Health Information Network Trial Implementations.  The purpose of this project is for state, regional and non-geographic health information exchange consortia to become components of the "network of networks" that is the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN). These consortia should combine inclusive organizational governance and trust relationships, provider organizations and healthcare markets, consumer applications and participating consumers, existing health exchange activities and technical expertise.   
Each Contractor shall work cooperatively with the other contractors to develop specifications for, and trial implementations of, the NHIN, and test these trial implementations with each other to ensure that they can all work together to implement an interoperable "network of networks" - built on top of the Internet. The trial implementations shall demonstrate core services, exchange summary patient records and support the capabilities outlined in several AHIC use cases based on shared NHIN standards and specifications. The trial implementations shall demonstrate the represented information exchanges with provider organizations, personal health records, specialty networks, and the other NHIN contractors.
This is a partial small business set-aside with up to a third of the contracts awarded to small businesses. We anticipate the award of up to 10 contracts. The period of performance shall be for a period of 1 year, with two 1-year options.  Options will be evaluated with the base period.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Informatin System (EOSDIS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Operations which was posted on April 24, 2007. You are notified that the following changes are made: RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS RECEIVED ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THIS MODIFICATION. The due date for responses is not extended. RFI ASF 2007 Responses to Questions received for the SAR DAAC RFI 1. Question:  Is this on a Cost No Fee structure? Answer:  As stated in the RFI, The contract will be Cost No Fee. 2. Question:  Has it been set up for a Small Business Set  Aside? Answer:  No. 3. Question:  Is there a way we might be able to work with the Incumbent? If so can you provide us with information on how to contact them? Answer:  As stated in the RFI, The EOSDIS SAR DAAC is currently located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF).	Their website is http://www.asf.alaska.edu/ 4. Question:  Does " The facility must be located within the United States of America and be able to receive and process data acquired at ground stations located in Alaska in near-real time" from the synopsis mean that you require the new site to be able to receive direct feeds from the same satellites as Alaska Satellite Facility currently does? Answer:  The DAAC must be able to receive and process data acquired at ground stations located in Alaska in near-real time.  It does not include operation of a ground station.  At this time,  some of the data does come in from ground stations located in Alaska. 5. Question:  What data storage and data processing equipment and software is currently used by the incumbent? Answer:  Data is stored online on RAIDed disks and near-line in a StorageTek Powderhorn silo with 9940 tape drives.  Archival Management and Storage System (AMASS) software is used. 6. Question:  Reference: The contract will be Cost No Fee.    What is the definition of Cost No Fee?  Is this contract type for Non-Profit organizations?	 This would preclude a for profit company to bid. Answer:  A cost-reimbursement contract in which the contractor receives no fee. 7. Question:  Reference: Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of five (5) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein, which conforms to Annex 1, "Template For SAR Facility Continuing Operations Submittal." 	    Based upon the page restriction of 5 pages it will be very difficult to provide adequate detail for such an operation. Have you give any thought to increasing this page limit? Answer:  The Government finds the page limitation of (5) pages adequate. 8. Question:  Is the response due May 24, 2007? Answer:  Responses to the RFI are due by May 24, 2007. 9. Question:  Is their [sic] a contractor supporting the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the current DAAC operations?   Answer:  No. 10. Question:  Is their [sic] an existing contract and if so when does it expire? Answer:  The current contract expires on March 31, 2008. 11. Question:  Has the due date or format of the response to the RFI for this opportunity changed?  Is so, what are the changes? Answer:  It is recommended that interested companies follow the instructions in this RFI for the due date and format for responses. 12. Question:  What are the current costs for running this operation?  How is this DAAC funded and is the budget available? Answer:  The current costs average approximately $7M per year.	The funding is provided on an incremental basis and funding will be available for the new contract at time of award. 13. Question:  Can you tell me what level of detail you are looking for in the rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the RFI?  For example, do you need individual salary information and line item detail or are you looking for category level information? Answer:  Your estimate should include total labor dollars and number of hours, travel dollars, miscellaneous costs, equipment and materials that equate to your estimated totals for any given period.  Individual salary information and line item detail are not required in response to this RFI. 14. Question:  Is the Government expecting an offeror to provide all facilities (building, computer floor, power, air conditioning, and communication network etc.) that would be staffed by the offeror to conduct SAR DAAC operations?  Answer:  Yes. 15. Question:  Would the Government make the current SAR DAAC facility, located at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, available (as an Government Furnished Item (GFI)) to the offeror for staffing the facility and providing SAR DAAC operations and sustaining engineering support services (labor only)? Answer: No. 16. Question:  Are there any major development and/or enhancement plans for the SAR DAAC?  If so, what are they for assessing new development cost estimate?  The SOW notes only the need for sustaining engineering for the SAR DAAC.  Paragraph 10 in the RFI requires an offeror to "show how the system could adapt to growth in the user community". Answer: The major development for the SAR DAAC has been completed and it is in a sustaining engineering and maintenance phase. There are no new development costs.  As stated in the RFI, responders to the RFI should Describe how your approach to providing the system could adapt to growth in the user community, changes in the systems interfaces, and changes in technology. 17. Question:  Section 4 in the RFI requires a rough estimate of the cost to "operate" the SAR facility on an "annual" basis.	What is the total period of performance (number of years - Base Year and Option Years) for providing a cost estimate? Answer:  As stated in the RFI, responders should Provide a rough estimate of the cost to operate the SAR Facility on an annual basis.  The period of performance of the current contract is November 17, 2003 - March 31, 2008. 18. Question:  Assuming that only a one year cost estimate for operating the SAR DAAC is required, the total estimated cost could be under $3 Million.  Would you consider a switchover of the SAR DAAC Operations to a qualified 8(a) business under the SBAs 8(a) Sole Source award program? Answer:  At this time, the Government is seeking information for planning purposes and as such, no commitment to a contract is being sought. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>15 CONS is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Hickam AFB, Bellows AFB, and other installations in the Hawaiian Islands.  The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 ? Construction, Subsection 233 ? Building Development and General Contracting ? size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 ? Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $200,000 - $5,000,000, but may be less or greater.  The program is Not-to-Exceed $90,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The government anticipates awarding  approximately 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 22 June 2007.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) singe government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). The government intends to host an industry day at Hickam Air Force Base in order to field questions on the MACC. The date i

<DESC>The Government has identified a requirement to procure 750 PIEZO Cables/Pin assemblies to support the Joint Navy/AF effort to test the ignitability of PBXN-109 with 3 types of fuze boosters (Tetryl, N-7, and CH-6).

This is a sole source procurement because all of the previous testing in the series was performed with this specific instrumentation and modifying the test setup can have a detrimental effect on the comparability of future tests to previous ones, which is a required element; and these pins/cables are compatible with our testing instrumentation that records the data.
The contractor shall fabricate cables using the following parts in accordance with the Navy test requirements:
Item 1, 750 ea  PIEZO PIN # CA-1136 x 1 inch
Item 2, 750 ea  Cable assembly # CA-111146-3*25 Feet.        

The 750 Piezo Cables are required to be delivered by 1 Aug 07.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library ON OR BEFORE 23 May 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC  14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDER?S LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development (USAID/Washington) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its Mission in the Republic of Haiti in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement, level of effort contract to provide technical assistance to the new democratically-elected Government of Haiti.  To enhance Haitis capacity to undertake an ambitious development plan, the Government of Haiti (GOH) has requested US technical assistance in implementing significant reforms and modernizing state functions based on best practice models.  To assist the GOH in its effort, USAID intends to provide for the services of technical advisors to GOH Ministries and Offices (Ministries of Planning and External Cooperation, Commerce, Education, Agriculture, Justice, Public Works, Womens Affairs, Environment, Finance, the Investment Facilitation Center, the Prime Ministers Office, et al) under an Advisory and Assistance Services contract that will expand US support over the next three years (2007 / 2010), helping to strengthen GOH institutions and to ensure that the USG and other donor investments continue to achieve their full potential while instilling best practices in the institutions supported.  The successful contractor will work with the GOH Ministry of Plan and External Cooperation and USAID/Haiti to determine the placement of advisors based on a needs assessment or in response to a request for technical assistance.  This is a three-year activity, including one base year and two option years.
This requirement will be subject to full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.) and the cooperating country.  Total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be 1,272 person months over a 3 year period (one base year and two option years).

<DESC>The ships service and control air compressors on the T-AO 187 Class vessels need to be replaced.  The current compressor units are inefficient to operate, costly to repair, and maintenance intensive.  MSC will replace the current models with a more efficient, more reliable type of air compressor that has an economically feasible preventative maintenance program.  The ships service air system requires clean, dry, oil-free air to serve various shops, whistles, atomizing, and tool hose services.  The control air system serves various pneumatically operated valves, main engine clutch control, shaft brake, and various control valves.  Eight ships of the class have already replaced the Nash units with Quincy Air Compressors (Model #QSI-220) and Quincy Air Dryer Packages (Model #QDTH-250).  

The use of the brand name, Quincy Air Compressors (Model #QSI-220) and Quincy Air Dryer Packages (Model #QDTH-250), is essential to the Government?s requirement and precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  These specific models are required to maintain configuration control among the 14 ships, maintain familiarization for shipboard and shore-side crews, and ensure commonality of spare parts within the logistics system.  

This acquisition will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Competition for this procurement will be other than full and open.  The procurement will be limited to offerors who can provide the brand name products described above.  The solicitation resulting from this notice will be available on or about 22 MAY 2007.  Once the solicitation has been posted, it will be available at www.msc.navy.mil.  Click on Contracts (upper right hand corner), click on Request for Proposals, search for solicitation number N00033-07-R-8013, and follow the download instructions.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) requires a Contractor to provide Accelerated Aging Testing of a Locomotive Emission Control System.  This testing shall be conducted in close collaboration with the EPA NVFEL.  The project goals include, but are not limited to:  (1) Greater than 80% NOx reduction capacity at Notch 8 at the end of testing, and (2) SCR, DOC and PM filter durability.  The contractor shall supply all materials for this project except the ECS system, urea dosing system(s), oil injection system, lube oil, NOx sensors, exhaust burner, and any required LabView code.  Coding will also be required for urea dosing and exhaust burner control if it is to be controlled by the test site computer. The initial test shall be for 500 hours. The specifics of the test are as follows:  (1) Test Engine:  A Cummins ISX non-EGR equipped engine provided shall be provided by the contractor (4 gram engine out NOx);  (2) Test ECS Hardware:  The test is run using a dual-flow path system.  Exhaust system inlet and outlet cones, catalysts, NOx sensors, urea injector, lube oil injector and system control drivers will be provided by EPA.  Appropriate National Instruments hardware shall be provided by the contractor.  All exhaust tubing entering and exiting the ECS shall be 4? in diameter.  The contractor shall be expected to provide all emission control system monitoring components including dP sensors and thermocouples of a type specified by EPA.  The contractor shall also be expected to integrate the ECS into their existing test cell set up;   (3) Test Fuel and Oil Specifications:  The testing is to be performed using diesel fuel with a nominal sulfur concentration of 10 ppm.  Engine lube oil shall be of a low SAP type.  Lube oil will be provided by EPA.  32.5% urea in water solution shall be provided by the contractor.  Urea solution may be purchased from NALCO Corporation, Naperville, IL, (248) 344-7564;   (4) Urea, Lube Oil, and Fuel Consumption Rates:  Urea consumption shall be about 4% of fuel consumption.  EPA will provide lube oil.  To accelerate aging, lube oil will be injected into the intake manifold of the engine at a rate of approximately 0.5% of fuel consumption.  EPA would like this injection to be controlled by or integrated into the contractor?s test cell controller.  Engine fuel consumption rate shall be determined by the contractor.  A burner will be incorporated into the exhaust system to generate exhaust temperatures of up to 700?C.  The fuel consumption of the burner shall be taken into consideration.  The contractor shall install the burner and oil injection system;   (5)  Aging Mode: AVL Mode 8 (for the ISX, about 1800 rpm and 90% throttle).  This is equivalent to locomotive Notch 8.  Approximate exhaust temperature will be 430?C;  (6)  Emissions: Emissions check of regulated pollutants is not required.  All NOx measurement will be performed using ZrO2 NOx sensors provided by EPA;  (7)  Test Data Requirement:  All applicable data channels will be recorded.  Data shall be made available daily to the EPA via the internet;  (8) Test Goals:  The overall goal of the test shall be to maintain a NOx reduction efficiency of > 80% throughout the test.   This testing also includes three (3) options for additional testing.  Option 1:  Run a second engine in parallel with and in the same configuration as the engine described above.  This will require a second test site and engine and would be used to age a second pair of emission control systems;  Option 2:  Maximum of 30 additional 100-hour increments (3000 hours total) of locomotive emission control system aging as set forth above;  Option 3 Maximum of 8 test cell down times of one week each for removal of catalysts for evaluation by EPA away from the contractor?s site. The contractor shall provide a final report by August 31, 2007 giving an overview of the testing performed.  Also the contractor shall perform daily monitoring of the engine and ECS to insure that the system is operating properly.  Detailed logs of test hours, issues, and resolutions will be kept in a computer file that can be sent to the EPA at any time during the course of the test at EPA?s request. This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 811198 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Award will be made using ?Best Value? evaluation criteria.  All responsible sources capable of providing the required Accelerated Aging Testing of a Locomotive Emission Control System may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be posted on the Fedbizopps.gov website by May 8, 2007.  Questions should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored. See Note 1

<SUBJECT>58 -- 700MHz Wireless Broadband
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NISTOLES00001JW
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Jacqueline Wright, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 497-5282, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email Jacqueline.S.Wright@noaa.gov
<DESC>700MHz Wireless Broadband
The National Institute of Standards and Technology Office of Law Enforcement Standards (NIST/OLES), Boulder Laboratories, Boulder CO, is in the process of analyzing wireless broadband technologies for use by public safety agencies in the 700MHz spectrum.  The first step in this process is to determine what companies offer products that may fulfill the needs of public safety.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) announcement and NOT A SOLICITATION.  Respondents are not limited to NAICS Code 517212.  The responses provided by the vendors will allow us to compile the necessary information to help public safety make informed choices on broadband equipment as well as help NIST/OLES better understand the available technologies better.

Disclaimer

It should be fully understood by all companies who provide responses to this document that this is in no way is an endorsement from NIST/OLES.  The information given to NIST/OLES is strictly for research purposes.  At no time should press releases or any type of sales brochures references be made with regards to this process.

It should also be understood that any and all information provided, unless specifically noted by the company, will eventually be made available to the public safety community.  If specific information is covered by an existing NDA, this should be clearly described in the reply.
 
Spectrum

24MHz of spectrum has been allocated to public safety use.  This spectrum is a result of digital television channel clearing that is taking place and will be completed nationwide by 2009.  The proposed FCC rulings allocate 12MHz of paired spectrum (24MHz total) for nationwide public safety use.  Public Safety broadband will occupy 5~6MHz per channel (10~12MHz total) of the 24MHz allocated.  The FCC has many proposals that have been submitted for comment.  In general the broadband frequencies cover the following spectrum and any equipment specified in the RFI should be able to operate within this frequency range.
?	First band covers 763 ? 776MHz (Typically Basestation Tx)
?	Second band covers 793 ? 806MHz (Typically Basestation Rx)

NOTE: Broadband references channel sizes greater than 1Mhz

The 700MHz A, C & D blocks are spectrum that may be auctioned off for commercial use or for use in a public/private trust for public safety broadband use.  There are several proposals for use of this spectrum from industry.  At the time of this RFI it is unknown what the outcome will be on these spectrum blocks.  However, it should be noted that whatever analysis and recommendations are created from this project will, and should, be compatible and interoperable within this spectrum block.

Wireless Broadband Technologies

Several known technologies could satisfy the needs in this spectrum ? others may be viable but are not part of this project scope.  It is the desire to take advantage of COTS products and the economies of scale to help advance the technology into the marketplace quicker and reduce costs to public safety.

?	IEEE 802.16e ?Mobile WiMax?
o	Both Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) should be considered
?	IEEE 802.11xx ?Mobile WiFi?
?	IS-856 ?EV-DO Revision A & B?
?	3GPP2 ?UMB ? Ultra Mobile Broadband? or EV-DO Revision C
?	3GPP Release 5/6 ?WCDMA, UMTS, HSPA?  
o	Both TDD and FDD should be considered
?	3GPP Release 8 ?LTE ? Long Term Evolution? 
o	Both TDD and FDD should be considered

 
IP Convergence

The RFI is inclusive of the entire ecosystem required for a broadband network.  In addition to the radio technologies being investigated, the IP ?backbone? is also being explored. 

Due to potential frequency spectrum issues and the cost of deploying a nationwide wireless network ? the broadband network will need to be shared across agencies and likely jurisdictions.  The convergence of subscriber user information, applications and overall IP access will need to take place.  There seems to be overall acceptance of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture by the prevailing broadband standards bodies.

Request For Information Questions

The next nine sections contain questions and requirement statements on the specific information we need to gather on 700MHz broadband equipment.  Please provide as much information about your current or future products that can address these questions and statements.

Minimum Feature & Functionality Requirements

The following chart is an example of the typical wireless data services required by public safety.  This is only an example is not necessarily representative of all of the wireless data requirements for public safety.  Please note that the information provided should be for packet switched data networks only.  Circuit switched services and data are not part o this RFI.

1.	Infrastructure and subscriber devices must operate in the 700MHz spectrum as noted in the previous section.  Center channels shall be 765.25MHz and 794.75MHz respectively.
2.	Full mobility from pedestrian to 160 km/hr, including seamless handover/handoff without loss of data (including streaming media and VOIP) as observed by the user
a.	Maximum 2% Packet Loss can be assumed
b.	1% Blocking Probability can be assumed
c.	Maximum 30% soft/softer handoff can be assumed
3.	Meet the throughput requirements for public safety for various applications, even at the edge of coverage (cell edge)
4.	Support end-to-end Quality of Service - QoS (based on application and/or users)
5.	Full system Operations and Maintenance (O&M) to all network nodes
6.	Support end-to-end multicast/broadcast both on uplink and downlink (1 to many)
7.	Integrated AAA and HSS functionality.  Should support multiple user profiles and provide AES encryption and key management.
8.	Over the air service programming and re-keying 
9.	Scaleable infrastructure for very small rural systems to large metro/urban systems

10.	Ten year Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF)


Cost
In order to determine general cost of the network for budgetary purposes, there are several pricing factors that need to be known.  Any pricing information shall be general in nature, and will be used to help the Government formulate an independent cost estimate.  Pricing will not be negotiated or considered at this time.
1.	System dimensioning rules for the network and their interfaces, including but not limited to:
a.	Air interface and its spectrum requirements
b.	Base station/access point/radio sites 
c.	Backhaul
d.	Radio Network Controllers , Base Station Controllers, OSS, ASN
e.	GPRS Node or PDSN (Home Agent) ? Mobile IP will need to be supported
f.	IMS ? including CSCF, HSS (including AAA functionality), SLF, AS, BGCF, MRF, PSTN/CS Gateway, MGW
2.	Provide the cost of each component of the network and also the incremental costs to increase system capacity.
3.	The network elements? costs will include the redundant parts (cards, interfaces, etc.) that will avoid single point of failures. N+1 redundancy schemes are preferred
4.	Provide any performance and capabilities of the vendor?s implementation of broadband wireless technologies.
5.	Provide information on when the various components and technology will be available.

Network Architecture
The 700MHz public safety broadband network will likely be based upon a mobile IP (MIP) network and will require a higher level of redundancy than typical wireless networks.  The use of IPv6 is the preferred option and to deploy with this type of implementation.  All network equipment must be upgradeable to IPv6 from IPv4.  It is understood that IP migration may need to take place.  Please provide any information pertinent to this subject.

Most of the architecture for wireless and cellular based networks do not provide redundancy for the IP network.  The project is also investigating the concept of a ?flat IP? implementation.  A ?flat? network would have the home agent (HA) at the network edge ? likely collocated within the BTS.  This would allow significant IP routing capabilities and support the use of multiple backhaul facilities (fiber, microwave) and offer another level of redundancy to support redundant core networks.  Please provide any information pertinent to a ?flat IP? network implementation.

a.	How is the message structure setup
b.	How are the channels managed differently 
c.	What impact on capacity does using this service have
5.	What priority access levels are allowed in the proposed system and how are they implemented?
6.	Provide information on how the proposed system would handle the following priority and overload condition issue:  In a single sector of coverage you have a large number of users.  The number of users is much, much larger than what the system is designed. In an emergency/overload situation where everyone in sector tries to setup a call at nearly the same time how does the system handle this and in particular: 
a.	If the ?access channel? (used generically) is overloaded with requests, how are collisions avoided or mitigated? 
b.	How are users with priority access (public safety) given that priority access when this situation happens?


Subscriber Options
1.	Do you manufacture subscriber devices for each protocol proposed?  Provide details on availability and cost.

<DESC>FA8601-07-R-0036 WPAFB Restoration O&M Program Landfills 8&10, GWTS, 7 Landfills & Spill Site #11. This is a Sources Sought Notice for planning  purposes only. The purpose of this notice is to identify firms who possess  capability and experience to provide for the operation and maintenance of  a Groundwater Treatment System, three remedial action systems at two  landfills, and landfill caps or covers at seven landfills and one spill  site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), OH.  This is not a notice  of solicitation issue.  This Sources Sought Notice does not constitute a  Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this  issuance restrict the Governments acquisition approach. The WPAFB Environmental Management Division Restoration Operations and  Maintenance Program includes the following three activities: (1) Groundwater Treatment System located near Landfill 5 and the backup  temporary air stripper. The Groundwater Treatment System consists of two  major subsystems: Groundwater Extraction System and Groundwater Treatment  Facility (including the scale inhibitor control system). The Groundwater  Treatment System is designed to capture a plume of volatile organic  compounds (VOCs) migrating across the base boundary and to remove VOCs  from the water prior to discharge to either the Mad River or western Twin  Lake. (2) Three remedial action systems at Landfills 8 and 10 in Operable Unit 1  (OU1).  The three systems consist of engineered impermeable landfill caps,  landfill gas collection and treatment unit, leachate collection and  discharge to the city of Fairborn Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW)  and flow monitoring. (3) Landfill caps or covers constructed at Landfills 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 & 11  and Spill Site 11.  The Landfill 5 (LF 5) cap consists of engineered  multiple layers designed to be impermeable. The Landfill 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11  cover systems consist of an 18-inch compacted common soil layer overlain  by six inches of top soil. Spill Site 11 consists of a French-drain system  collecting fuel contaminated groundwater and surface water runoff which is  pumped to an oil/water separator. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562211. Interested parties should submit intent by 4:00 p.m. (local Dayton, OH  time) on 5 June 2007.  Responses should include the following: (1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for the  forthcoming solicitation; (2) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact  with their phone numbers; (3) evidence of capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment  bonds; (4) small business certification, if applicable.  Responses shall  be limited to five pages.  No facsimile responses will be accepted.  The  government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  Sources Sought Notice nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs  associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The solicitation/RFP will be issued electronically.   It will be posted on  the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ and the Wright-Patterson AFB Pre-Award  Information Exchange System (PIXS) website at:  http://www/pixs/wpafb.af.mil/.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE ISSUED FOR ANY  REASON.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the Central  Contractor Registration (CCR) to be the Single DoD registration for  contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting  business with the Department. Defense procurement and finance policies  require contractors to be registered by for consideration in future  solicitations, awards, and payment.  DoD contracting officers worldwide  will use CCR to identify sources and financial officers will use it to  make payments. To register in CCR, you may use one of the following  methods: (a) call telephone number 1-888-CCR-2423 for further information. (b) Input directly to CCR through the interactive World Wide Web  application at http://www.ccr.gov/. Contractors must be registered in CCR  prior to award for any solicitations.

(GOES-SST) products have been operational since December 2000 and are already widely used by the scientific community. There has been on going program improvements to the GOES-SST processing, including the adoption of radiative transfer based retrieval methods a new cloud detection methodology based on fast radiative transfer calculations and the Application of Bayes? probability theorem, raising the prospect of being able to propagate cloud detection confidence information into SST error estimates on a pixel-by-pixel within each scene. The University of Edinburgh is being tasked to provide further research in the following areas: 1. Revisions to the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Bayesian Cloud Screening to reflect the use of the TRICS modularized code (large software change and many science changes),. 2. To assess the use of the 13 um channel available on GOES-12 for improving the performance of Bayesian cloud screening for GOES-SST. The University of Edinburgh has collaborated with Meteo-France for geostationary SST products over the North Atlantic derived from GOES-8 data and are currently collaborating with them for MSG/SEVIRI: A merged MSG and GOES-12 SSY product has been developed by the University of Edinburg and Meteo-France as part of the Eumetsat Ocean & Sea-Ice ?Satellite application Facility. Specific Tasks 1. Generate documentation that describes the Modular Bayesian Software (before 13 um Trail). 2. Determine the benefits from using 13um channel in GOES-12 Bayesian cloud Screening. 3. Generate look-up tables and software to support use of 13 um cloud screening. 4. Describe the software that was implemented as a result of implemented 13 um trail. This procurement is being conducted  per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE$100K).  Interested persons may identify their interest, however must demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in order to be considered. This is not a request for Competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshall Service (USMS), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  Currently, no solicitation is available.  This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps.  All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  It is the potential offeror?s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

On May 4, 2007, OFDT exercised the last Option Period for USMS Contract MS-03-D0013, Comprehensive Detention Services, in Pinal County, Arizona.  The contract was originally awarded on May 5, 2003 to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, TN 37212.  OFDT is considering awarding a follow-on contract to CCA for a period of not less than 10 years, however, not more than 20 years.  OFDT considers these services available only from the original source in the case of this follow-on contract which is for the continued provision of highly specialized detention services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.




The anticipated scope of services to be provided and their respective functional areas are detailed below: 

OFDT is in search of existing detention facility located within the geographic boundaries of Pinal County, Arizona with a capacity of not less than 3,500 beds to house persons in custody of USMS and ICE.  The requirement will include secure transportation services from the facility throughout the Southwest Border.

Construction of a new facility is not a consideration for this request.

Other Interested parties having the required physical plant to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement to include the following: (1) Name and address of firm; (2) Size of business; (3) Average annual revenue for past three years; (4) Number of employees; (5) Ownership of firm; (6) Business size (large, small, disadvantage); (7) Number of years in business; (8) Affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor if potential sub, subcontractors if potential prime; and (9) List of customers cover past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contact with address and phone number).

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or will the Government pay for any information solicited.  All responses shall be submitted to Michael Moran no later than June 22, 2007.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial items contract to Eaton Electric, Inc. located at 8609 Six Forks Road, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27615 to provide maintenance and service of four 2000 KVA Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) designed, installed, and modified by Eaton Electrical, Inc., formerly Exide, and all associated equipment in SSA's National Computer Center located in Baltimore, Maryland.   The equipment includes an Exide Electronics 8000 kva redundant solid state UPS system, associated microprocessor-based self diagnostic package (Data Trax), four 192 battery sub-systems, Cell Watch battery monitoring system, Hot Tie and all related breakers and switchgear. 
Eaton Electric Inc. (formerly "Exide Electronics" and "Powerware") have been performing preventative and remedial maintenance and repairs on the SSA/NCC UPS system since it was installed in 1978.  Exide Electronics designed, installed and tested the original UPS system.   Exide Electronics upgraded the UPS system currently in operation at the NCC to a more efficient and reliable unit in 1993.  In 1996 the logic cards were upgraded to the newest system used today.  In 1999 a "Hot Tie" system was installed to further protect the critical load of the NCC.  Powerware engineers and technicians did the design, installation and testing of the modified system.  After the upgrades, the UPS became a more efficient and reliable running unit, however the upgrading of the UPS did involve proto type circuitry that was designed and manufactured solely by Powerware Corporation.  All technical information, schematics, printed circuit boards and software is proprietary and is only available through Eaton Electric Inc. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13. It is SSA's belief that Eaton Electric is the only source qualified to meet our needs because of its' ability to service hardware and software which is of a proprietary nature.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to Kimberly Huttenberger via email at Kimberly.Huttenberger@ssa.gov no later than 4:30pm, EST, May 24, 2007.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>--Sensor Processing, Exploitation, and Coordination
<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dynetics, Incorporated, Huntsville, Alabama, for a three (3) month extension to the current Dynetics Contract DASG60-99-D-0003.  The proposed action is pur suant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This extension is required to maintain uninterrupted Sensor Processing, Exploitation, and Coordination support pending completion of a competitive award currently underway.  Award to any source other than Dynetics would not support current agency and customer commitments and would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing contract.  The e xtension will support the execution of work in progress and planned until a new competitive award can be completed.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition of this short term effort.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward Dynetics, Incorporated.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Jae Steele at jae.ste ele@smdc.army.mil or Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or service s for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60-99-D-0003 is not a request for competitive pro posals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  T his is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry).

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Notes to clause FAR 52.216-2:
(1)	for any contract price adjustment requests to CLIN 0001A, (fuel price), the contractor shall request the price adjustment in writing to the Contracting Officer and provide adequate supporting documentation showing current fuel prices (see 3,  fuel cost submittals below)
(2)	Contract price adjustments shall be limited to one adjustment
(3)	Contract price increases shall not be retroactive, unless the request for increase is received within 10 days of the increase in accordance with FAR 52.216-29(c)(1).  However, in the event that the contractor fails to notify the contracting Officer promptly in writing of any decreases in prices, as required by FAR 52.216-2(b) below, then the Government may adjust the price retroactively to reflect the decrease in prices.
(4)	The following is a hypothetical example to demonstrate contract price adjustment in accordance with FAR 52.216-2:
a.	Assume, for the purpose of this example, that fuel costs are $2.00 per gallon at the time of contract award.
b.	Assume that the contractor requests a price adjustment timely and provides documentation that fuel price have risen to $2.40 per gallon, representing an increase of 20%.
c.	Assuming that the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor?s supporting documentation was sufficient and that the proposed adjustment was fir and reasonable, then the Government would perform a price adjustment ant thereafter compensate the contractor at the adjusted rate of $2.40 per gallon.  
d.	However, in accordance with paragraph FAR 52.216-( c)(1), the maximum aggregate increase over the summer would be 100%.  Thus, if before delivery the price were to exceed $4.00 per gallon (which is 100% of $2.00 in this example) then the Contractor would not receive any further price adjustments.
   52.216-2  Economic Price Adjustment?Standard Supplies.

NASAs safety priority is to protect: (1) the public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), and (4) high-value equipment and property.     (b) The Contractor shall take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures in performing this contract. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws applicable to safety and occupational health and with the safety and occupational health standards, specifications, reporting requirements, and any other relevant requirements of this contract.    (c) The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other safety, and occupational health measures the Contracting Officer may reasonably direct.	To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be determined pursuant to the procedures of the changes clause of this contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.    (d) The Contractor shall immediately notify and promptly report to the Contracting Officer or a designee any accident, incident, or exposure resulting in fatality, lost-time occupational injury, occupational disease, contamination of property beyond any stated acceptable limits set forth in the contract Schedule; or property loss of $25,000 or more, or Close Call (a situation or occurrence with no injury, no damage or only minor damage (less than $1,000) but possesses the potential to cause any type mishap, or any injury, damage, or negative mission impact) that may be of immediate interest to NASA, arising out of work performed under this contract.  The Contractor is not required to include in any report an expression of opinion as to the fault or negligence of any employee.  In addition, service contractors (excluding construction contracts) shall provide quarterly reports specifying lost-time frequency rate, number of lost-time injuries, exposure, and accident/incident dollar losses as specified in the contract Schedule.    (e) The Contractor shall investigate all work-related incidents, accidents, and Close Calls, to the extent necessary to determine their causes and furnish the Contracting Officer a report, in such form as the Contracting Officer may require, of the investigative findings and proposed or completed corrective actions.    (f)(1) The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing of any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to be taken.  When the Contracting Officer becomes aware of noncompliance that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and health of the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value mission critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The Contractor shall promptly take and report any necessary corrective action.        (2)  If the Contractor fails or refuses to institute prompt corrective action in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may invoke the stop-work order clause in this contract or any other remedy available to the Government in the event of such failure or refusal.     (g) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g) and any applicable Schedule provisions and clauses, with appropriate changes of designations of the parties, in all solicitations and subcontracts of every tier, when one or more of the following conditions exist:    (1) The work will be conducted completely or partly on premises owned or controlled by the Government.    (2) The work includes construction, alteration, or repair of facilities in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.    (3) The work, regardless of place of performance, involves hazards that could endanger the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including Contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value equipment or property, and the hazards are not adequately addressed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (if applicable).    (4) When the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) determines that the assessed risk and consequences of a failure to properly manage and control the hazard(s) warrants use of the clause.      (h) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) may exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from its solicitation(s) and subcontract(s) of every tier when it determines that the clause is not necessary because the application of the OSHA and DOT (if applicable) regulations constitute adequate safety and occupational health protection.  When a determination is made to exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from a solicitation and subcontract, the Contractor must notify and provide the basis for the determination to the Contracting Officer.  In subcontracts of every tier above the micro-purchase threshold for which paragraph (g) does not apply, the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f) of this clause).   (i) Authorized Government representatives of the Contracting Officer shall have access to and the right to examine the sites or areas where work under this contract is being performed in order to determine the adequacy of the Contractor's safety and occupational health measures under this clause.    (j) The contractor shall continually update the safety and health plan when necessary.

The Government will issue an order to the responsible quoter submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  The contractor must bid on ALL items and must be quoted FOB Destination.  Substitutes will not be accepted based on the Brand Name Justification as follow:  The equipment to be procured must be compatible with the existing DINFOS Broadcast architecture and automation systems.  The equipment listed in these project lines has been fully designed into the overall project.  Substitution with another vendor?s product would result in significant redesign time, possible changes to other equipment specifications elsewhere in the project, and slower implementation of the system.  The Evertz sync generators and changeover switch, Dorrough meters, and Leitch circuit cards are the same models used elsewhere in the current DINFOS system.  We have standardized on these products to both eliminate the need for additional parts stock, and to have similar systems in each classroom.  Substitution would also result in changes to curriculum in this particular instance, which would delay actual student use for training.

This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov:

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541330 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for Linear Soller Collimators to be used in the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

BACKGROUND
The NIST Center for Neutron Research is a research facility that utilizes neutrons to study the fundamental properties of materials. Many different types of instruments are used to conduct this research. Different types of optical equipment are used on each instrument to filter/define/optimize or otherwise manipulate the neutron beam for a specific experiments requirement.  
	
A new Thermal Triple Axis Spectrometer (TTAS) is currently under development at The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The TTAS utilizes a neutron beam to study the fundamental properties of materials. The neutron beam in its basic form is random and chaotic. Optical equipment such as Collimators, help define the beam by aligning the flow of neutrons between a defined number of foils within a given width and height, much like lanes on a highway control the flow of traffic. This instrument contains many collimators of different types, sizes, and material compositions. This acquisition is for two (2) different sets of three (3), for a total of six (6), Soller Collimators that reside on the pre-sample side of the TTAS.

Question 1:   The user is asking for Raid 1 on the servers, but requesting 5 hard drives.  The controller will only do raid 0 and raid 1 and RAID 1 is usually only meant for 2 drives (not 5)

The workstations are asking for 5 hard drives in some cases and a DVD +/-RW and a DVD/CD-RW. You cannot have 5 hard drives and 2 optical drives in a workstation.

Response:1) The Server Configuration does not ask for 5 Hard Drives, the Servers (Configuration 1) have 4 Hard Drives per Server.  Also on the Servers there was no RAID Setting Specified.

2) Per the HP Specifications Web Page, the xw9400 Chassis has three External 5.25" Drives bays suitable for Optical Drives and 5 3.25" Hard Drive Bays.  Therefore he needs to provide some documentation that it won't work.  While we did not include his quote in our Market Research because Sandra Broadnax got all over us for even talking to a Large Business, we did ask him for pricing on this order and he quoted these configurations.

3) On no configureation is RAID 1 Specified, therefore his comments concerning RAID 1 have no relavance.  There are some workstations that have heterogenious drive mixes, so the following is what is desired:

Config 1: 3xDL385-4 Hard Drives each
 -- No RAID Specified

Config 2: 1 x xw9400
 -- 4x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 1x750GB Drive  - No RAID

Config 3: 5x xw9400
 -- 5x 750GB Drives - RAID 0

Config 4: 4x xw9400
 -- 2x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 3x750GB Drives - No RAID

Config 5: 4x xw9400
 -- 2x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 3x750GB Drives - No RAID

The records are generally arranged according to the Forest Service?s alphabetic filing code and a locally devised numbering system.  A database has been constructed and some photographs have been processed.  During processing, the overall number of boxes will be expanded, and a modified, more user-friendly finding aid will be created by the Contractor.

Within the containers, the 3.5 in. x 5.5 in. photographs are stored in varying conditions.  Most items are mounted onto 5 in. x 8 in. envelopes via corner mounts, not glued down.  The envelopes bear detailed, typed captions for each photograph, and contain several duplicate copies of each print.  In their current condition, these items are stored in acidic containers, which are potentially damaging to the images over time.  The items range in size from 2 x 2 in. to 8 x 10 in.

Records for the initial period consist of approximately 24 cubic feet of photographs stored in approximately 48 non-standard cartons measuring 5.25 in x 9.75 in x 14.75 in.  There are approximately 12,000 photographs and images.

Records for the option periods of the contract will include preservation on similar photograph and non-textual records from RG 95, but may also include non-textual records from other Federal agencies and National Record Groups such as RG 77, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

2.0   BASIC REQUIREMENTS
The Contractor will be required to perform the following processing and preservation services:
2.1 Remove non-textual items from current boxes.
2.2 Determine whether item can be removed from existing housing, if they are of sub-archival quality.  Most mounted items will be left on their backing sheets unless removal can be effected without damaging the item.
2.3 Place each item into appropriate archival housing (e.g., mylar sleeve, folders, etc.).  
2.4 Develop basic structure and enter identifying item information into an Access database.
2.5 In cases in which caption information was printed on the old housing, either transcribe the information onto the new enclosure, or photocopy the caption onto archival bond paper and attach it to or place it in the new sleeve.  This information will also be entered into a database.
2.6 Examine items for signs of deterioration; for example, fading, breaking, or cracked emulsion.  Make a notation in the database about these damaged items.
2.7 Place the properly housed items into archival-quality boxes of the appropriate size.  Arrangement within the box will depend on appropriate archival housing to prevent further damage (e.g., curling or slumping in box, etc.).
2.8 Place any textual materials in appropriately sized acid-free folders and archival containers, retaining/documenting their relationship to the non-textual records.
2.9 Create new box labels containing the following information (Label Sample):

Record group number (same on all boxes)
Record group title (same on all boxes)
Originating office (may vary with each series)
Series title (may vary with each series)
Box contents (varies on each box)
