<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract to conduct testing for National HIV Incidence Surveillance and other CDC HIV surveillance activities using the BED assay and remnant samples (serum, plasma, dried fluid spots) from newly diagnosed individuals from sites funded for HIV incidence surveillance and report the results to these sites.  The Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) is the currently accepted method used for the estimation of HIV incidence.  With STARHS, confirmed HIV-positive samples are analyzed using the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (BED assay).  The BED assay is a quantitative assay that indirectly measures the proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies with respect to total IgG.  Samples from recently infected patients have a lower proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibodies than samples from patients with long term infection and therefore can be classified as recently infected using this assay.   Quantitative values from this assay are evaluated against control values and cut-off points to estimate the likelihood that the sample being tested is from a newly infected individual or someone with a long term infection.  Results from the BED assay are used with clinical, demographic, and testing history information to estimate the incidence of a population.  

The major tasks to be completed under this contract include, 1) National Incidence Surveillance Testing/BED Assay, 2) Shipping Requirements, 3) Data Management and 4) STARHS Lab Briefings.  The CDC anticipates a period of performance from, January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, with four additional option years.  The estimated volume of tests per year is 150,000.

This is not a Request for Proposal.  The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2008-N-09691 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before November 13, 2007.  This will be a full and open competition.  Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Dyad Searcy at dsearcy@cdc.gov or Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to continually view the website for any amendments made to this notice.

<DESC>This requirement is for design, fabrication, performance, and acceptance testing of the Relay and Reduction Optics (RRO) system which will be used in a sensor test chamber operating under simulated deep space vacuum, temperature, and background radiation conditions.  This procurement will include a three-optical-component assembly that will provide the proper interface between a dual resistive emitter array projection system and an existing collimating optical system to produce an IR radiation projection system referred to as the Short Focal Length Collimator (SFLC) system.  The SFLC will complement the current collimating optical system in 7V that has a much longer focal length and thus has limited projection over the desired field of view (FOV).  The RRO optical system design must address analysis of IR radiometric throughput and spectral issues; mounting techniques for precision optics; low temperature thermal and thermo/structural design and analysis; selection and preparation of optical materials for cryogenic application and repeated thermal cycling; and control of contamination and optical surface scatter.  The performance of this optical system shall be demonstrated under high-vacuum, cryogenic operational conditions prior to final acceptance at AEDC.

Contracting Office Address:
DHS - Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Assistance Directorate, 500 C Street, S.W., PP, 5th Floor, Washington, DC, 20472

DESCRIPTION: 
NAICS for this RFI: 321991, 236117,624229, 236116,236115,321992.
FEMA established the Joint Housing Solutions Group to assess the viability of alternative housing options to increase the range of housing options that FEMA could provide to disaster victims.   This initiative encourages housing manufacturers to submit information on their housing structures to FEMA and is specifically targeting structures that are:
?	Readily available for purchase or, at a minimum, have a prototype built.
?	Suitable as disaster housing; namely, quickly deployable, low in cost, and safe in design.  
This initiative is focused on physical structures and is not soliciting information on haul and install, lenders, installers, part suppliers, or other housing related services that do not directly relate to the design and construction of housing structures.  
To respond to this RFI, FEMA invites housing builders and manufacturers to complete the Housing Assessment Tool (HAT) online at https://asd.fema.gov/inter/hat/home.htm   The HAT is a comprehensive tool containing nearly 200 questions that seek to gather information about a potential housing option?s range of use, timeliness of deployment after a disaster, livability for victims, and cost.  Completing the survey may require collaborative response from multiple individuals within your company.  Providers will be able to create a company profile in the HAT and then submit a housing profile for each of the housing options that the provider believes might be of interest to FEMA.    This research process is ongoing and the HAT will continue to be available after the RFI expires.  If you have already submitted your information via the above website, there is no need to re-submit your information unless your design or information has changed.
FEMA appreciates any and all replies to this RFI. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.

<b><u>India - Technical Assistance - National Gas Grid Project</u></b>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in developing a conceptual design for a National Gas Grid in India.
The Government of India has conceptualized a National Gas Grid that will deliver natural gas from the production fields and import receiving terminals to the end users in all Indian states.   A number of new pipelines have been planned and some of them are under construction, which will provide for intrastate gas transmission systems in the various Indian states.

The Technical Assistance concerning the National Gas Grid will take into account both the technical and commercial factors that affect design and construction, operations management, and gas transactions within the system.   It will address: (1) the physical interconnections of the pipelines and related capacity issues; (2) technology to manage, monitor and control the gas grid as an integrated operating system with a high degree of system reliability; (3) requirements and options for natural gas storage; (4) pipeline integrity and pipeline safety operations and technology; (5) gas transportation tariffs and practices, along with related technologies, and (6) pipeline systems security from a design and operations perspective. The Technical Assistance will also include a plan for implementation of the Project, including preliminary cost estimates and time phases for the various elements of work. While determining such cost estimates, the Contractor shall also consider cost competitive resources that can be procured or made available locally for implementation of the Project. It will analyze alternative strategies and technologies, and recommend the most appropriate solutions. The Technical Assistance will also take account of recent international experience in the application of various hardware and software technologies to natural gas transmission networks, and best practices.  The analysis will be coordinated with the Grantee.

The outcome of the TA will be influenced by such key factors as forecast of gas supply and demand growth, identification of regional demand concentrations, and establishment of the technical and commercial concepts for the development of the National Gas Grid in India.

<b><u>Romania - Black Sea Coastal Erosion Control Program (COASTEROSION) Phase I</u></b>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance with the development of COASTEROSION, whose design and implementation will allow the Government of Romania to assess - and by extension more effectively prevent and/or counteract - the drivers as well as the consequences of erosion along its Black Sea coastline.

In Romania, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development administers national environmental policy, with special emphases accorded those areas that influence economic development and welfare.

The Romanian Black Sea coastline has experienced significant erosion for several decades. Erosion along the coast limits socioeconomic opportunities and has detrimental impacts on public infrastructure and the environment. To remedy this situation, the Grantee is implementing the COASTEROSION program, Phase I of which involves the development of an Integrated Coastal Zone Modeling System (ICZMS) for the study of potential structural and non-structural coastal erosion control measures. Overall objectives of the COASTEROSION program are the control of erosion as well as the restoration and protection of the natural resources for sustainable development in the Romanian Black Sea coastal zone. The main goal of creating an ICZMS is to develop the necessary analytical tools to assess erosion control measures. Key targets for the Grantee are the protection of Danube River Delta wetland, erosion control and prevention at important socioeconomic tourism resorts, and the preservation of a healthy aquatic environment, in compliance with European Union's Water Framework Directive.

Phase I of the COASTEROSION program involves the assessment of the ICZMS spatial data requirements as well as specification of the software and hardware for a spatial data monitoring program and data management system within the context of a Romanian Coastal Zone Geographic Information System (GIS), which will be needed to interface with regional numerical models to implement a regional sand management system (RSM) similar to the RSM of the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center.  Additionally, Phase I involves the definition of the overall implementation framework for the COASTEROSION Program and identification of the Romanian institutional support required for its execution. Still further, Phase I includes the preparation of the Terms of Reference (TOR) and cost estimates for Phases II and III of the Program.

<U>COMPONENTS OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE</U>
The Grantee requires technical assistance to carry out Phase I of the COASTEROSION Program.  The Technical Assistance funded pursuant to this Grant Agreement includes only Phase I work.  Component tasks are as follows:

Task 1: Review of Relevant Reports and Data and Baseline Conditions Report 
Task 2: Integrated Coastal Zone Management System Institutional Framework
Task 3: Spatial Data Monitoring Stations, GIS and Communication Technology
Task 4: Preparation of Terms of Reference and Cost Estimate for Phases II and III 
Task 5: Economic Analysis  
Task 6: Financial Analysis  
Task 7: Environmental Analysis  
Task 8: Developmental Impact Analysis 
Task 9: Final Report 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $385,772 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <u>4:00 pm Eastern Time on December 4, 2007</u> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

FEEA is the only organization with experience in administering childcare tuition assistance programs for federal agencies.  FEEA has the ability to receive a specified sum of money from HRSA and distribute it to childcare providers as tuition assistance funds.

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance is for a period of twelve (12) months with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file, which states and supports that FEEA is the only organization that can provide these services.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Multi-discipline A-E design services for McChord AFB, Washington are to be procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  The Multi Disciplinary A-E Services shall include the primary capabilities for Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical, Mechanical, and Environmental (including performance of Hazardous Material Surveys) and including ?Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design? (LEED) Professional Accreditation in support of Air Force Sustainable Design and Development Policy.

The IDIQ contract will have a maximum monetary limit of $750,000 per year/period, with a minimum delivery order guarantee of $5,000 for the first task order during the first year.  The contract award and starting date will be approximately May 15, 2008 for a period not to exceed 12-months with four option periods not to exceed 12-months each which may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Work will be issued by means of a negotiated firm fixed-priced task orders.

The contract rates for the basic period shall begin on the date of the contract award and shall continue for 365 calendar days.  Typical investigative and design services shall be performed to support new construction; additions to existing facilities; remodel/renovation of existing facilities; alteration and repair of miscellaneous base wide infrastructure utilities and services such as water, sewer, electrical, communications, steam lines, fuel storage and transportation systems, airfield pavement projects, and integration of energy monitoring and control systems.

The design of the fire alarm and suppression systems shall be performed by ?National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies? certified engineer.  The following factors will be evaluated as the basis for selection for award of a contract.

The Secondary Criteria are; (a) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project with a declining point value given the farther a firm is located from McChord AFB and (b) the Volume of work DOD previously awarded to the firm within the last 12 months with the object of effecting equitable distribution of DOD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.  The Secondary Criteria are of lesser importance and evaluation point value than the Primary Criteria.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Regional Procurement Support Office and the Narcotics Affairs Office, Colombia are seeking qualified offerors for the NAS Colombia Internet Project to be located at 25 remote locations throughout Colombia. The Government intends to conduct a performance-based acquisition for this project and therefore will provide potential sources with a solicitation that includes a statement of objectives.  The reason for this approach is to provide the contractor with maximum flexibility to conceive and propose innovative approaches and solutions, leading to award of a performance-based contract and successful implementation of the new system.  Contractors shall submit a performance work statement with their quotations in response to this solicitation, describe how the work will be performed, including all proposed hardware, and activate the required service within the shortest feasible time frame.
The Government of Colombia, Colombian National Police, has an existing main national microwave system backbone that delivers Internet to 18 connecting points across Colombia.  This project is to provide high speed Internet connectivity from these 18 connecting points to the 25 remote locations depicted in the project drawings.  
This capability will strengthen the USG?s and Colombia?s ability to expeditiously confront and thwart criminal activity as well as to provide real time information that will permit the Colombian Government to more quickly respond to Natural Disasters and Civil Unrest within its population.
The solicitation is planned for release to qualified offerors on or about November 12, 2007, with contract award in December 2007.  It is anticipated that the project will commence as soon as possible after contract award(s), with a total performance period of approximately eight months for delivery of all materials, installation of materials at the 25 remote sites, training for Colombia National Police, and Operational Test Acceptance of the system.  The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price and the process will be conducted under FAR Part 12, Commercial Item Contracting.  In order to obtain the solicitation package (including drawings, Statement of Objectives and Specifications) offerors must forward their written requests via fax to Mr. Mark J. Toler at (954) 630-1165, or e-mail to TolerMJ@State.gov  within ten (10) days of publication of this advertisement.  Proposals/Quotations will be accepted from both U.S. and non-U.S. firms

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Siemens for a V7M Mini-Multiplane TEE Transducer and related accessories.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the only product that fits VA Hines needs, as it is the only Transducer that is compatible with our current ACUSON system. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Contract is firm fixed price and the NAICS Code is 334510. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and service, to the Contracting Officer within (6) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.  Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC GLAC, 5000 W. National Ave Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440.

The contractor will assess the Center's current claims processing for CHAMPVA, Spina Bifida Health Care program and the Foreign Medical Program. The contractor will map HAC business processes, data flow, data elements, and business requirements or constraints in the processing of a health care claim.

Only business process modeling will be completed for remaining health plans.  The gap analysis, requirements, and implementation plan are to be contractor NON-specific. The contractor should have past experience in health care claims processing, business process modeling, business process reengineering, technical and business documentation, and gap analysis and requirements documentation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

________________________________________________

The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<b><u>Guatemala - Customs Transit Control System Project</u></b>
Reference is made to the 25 September 2007 announcement, reference number 07-51012B, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to Guatemala's Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria (SAT) to improve its capacity to undertake customs modernization efforts.

On October 11, 2007, USTDA received an inquiry requesting clarification regarding Task 5 of the Terms of Reference, titled "Documentation, Training and Implementation Support."  The inquiry requests clarification regarding Task 5.7's meaning of "[full implementation of] the new processes and systems" at the listed custom offices and the estimated labor and break down provided for Task 5 in the desk study.  In consultation with decision/analysis partners, USTDA hereby provides the following clarification:

Task 5.7 of the TOR addresses general implementation of the new Customs Transit Control System.  The SAT has a very competent and available staff that is intended to be fully engaged with the Contractor "to design, test and implement the agreed-upon Customs Transit System" as stated in Task 1.2.  Clearly, a knowledge transfer from Contractor to SAT is expected.

The estimated Contractor labor for Task 5 is expressed as total contractor days, and no time duration for the Task is implied.  Task 4 provides a robust opportunity for the Contractor to negotiate the Transition and Implementation Plan with the Grantee.

USTDA is sharing this information for the benefit of all prospective bidders.

The response date for this RFP remains 3:00 PM (local time in Guatemala City, Guatemala), November 7, 2007 at the above address.

To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to  Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO)  Training Capability This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that  may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the  requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an  on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States  Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data.  The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in  this requirement has not been determined.  Contractors/Institutions  responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation  in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or  contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any  expenses associated with their participation in this survey. INSTRUCTIONS: 1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a  Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys  capability. 2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the  market research, you should provide documentation that supports your  companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide  documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately  assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a  particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome  the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of  the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this  Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged. 4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John  Webb at (937) 904-4254. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION T-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:            We are conducting market research to identify potential sources  that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the  requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems  Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data.  The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System  Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based  training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global  positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar  Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position  with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and  instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator  for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar  capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to  three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part  of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval  Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training  System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified  aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010  with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability  (FOC) in 2011. 	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the  aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical /  engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified  as integrated into the T-1 aircraft. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY T-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability Part I.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshall Service (USMS), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  Currently, no solicitation is available.  This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps.  All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  It is the potential offeror?s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

On May 4, 2007, OFDT exercised the last Option Period for USMS Contract MS-03-D0013, Comprehensive Detention Services, in Pinal County, Arizona.  The contract was originally awarded on May 5, 2003 to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, TN 37212.  OFDT is considering awarding a follow-on contract to CCA for a period of not less than 10 years, however, not more than 20 years.  OFDT considers these services available only from the original source in the case of this follow-on contract which is for the continued provision of highly specialized detention services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.




The anticipated scope of services to be provided and their respective functional areas are detailed below: 

OFDT is in search of existing detention facility located within the geographic boundaries of Pinal County, Arizona with a capacity of not less than 3,500 beds to house persons in custody of USMS and ICE.  The requirement will include secure transportation services from the facility throughout the Southwest Border.

Construction of a new facility is not a consideration for this request.

Other Interested parties having the required physical plant to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement to include the following: (1) Name and address of firm; (2) Size of business; (3) Average annual revenue for past three years; (4) Number of employees; (5) Ownership of firm; (6) Business size (large, small, disadvantage); (7) Number of years in business; (8) Affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor if potential sub, subcontractors if potential prime; and (9) List of customers cover past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contact with address and phone number).

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or will the Government pay for any information solicited.  All responses shall be submitted to Michael Moran no later than June 22, 2007.

The new outgoing tote conveyor has to connect to the original outgoing tote conveyor. The method used to lower the conveyor can in no way interfere with the rate of tote flow from or productivity of the system. The new layout must be in the same area but the conveyor may be extended to allow for height changes.
