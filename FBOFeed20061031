Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.

Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov .

The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation.

<DESC>The NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid to provide contracting support to the audit section at Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) in Norfolk, VA.

HQ SACT is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. HQ SACT intends to use the two envelope (sealed bid) bidding procedure. Partial bidding is authorized.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is ACT-SACT-06-54 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ACT-SACT-06-54.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The Command is endeavoring to strengthen its audit coverage throughout the HQ and subordinate commands to determine if effective and robust systems are in place. To ensure that NATO financial operations and governance procedures are operating effectively, the Command plans to appoint two auditors to its internal audit branch for an initial period of one year to participate in the delivery of the annual audit program of work. The appointees will work under the direction of the SACT Command Auditor. Although the contractors will be based at HQ SACT in Norfolk, VA, they will be required to make audit visits to subordinate commands and outstation locations in Europe for approximately 12 weeks per year.

ELIGIBILITY

The IFIB package will contain material classified up to NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

Companies located in a NATO member nation that have performed similar contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation are eligible to bid.

Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and possess at least a valid NATO SECRET level security clearance, have at least a bachelor-level degree from a recognized degree-granting institution, and/or have no less than a minimum of five years experience in internal audit.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to bid will be added to an electronic distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is issued, those firms will be notified electronically and will be instructed to download the tender documents on the following website: 

http://www.act.nato.int/budfin/rfpmain.htm.

As provided for under MBC rules, however, nominations from interested firms will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline to be placed on the electronic bidder distribution list: 16 November 2006

2. Planned Release Date of the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB): 20 November 2006

3. Planned Bid Closing Date: 04 January 2007

4. Period of performance: 2007 with one potential option year

<CONTACT>Randall Pickwell, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109661325, Fax 4109659560, Email randall.pickwell@ssa.gov
<DESC><B>Pre-Solicitation Notice :</B>
<P>
The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to release a Request for Proposals for TSRP (Telephone Systems Replacement Project) to FedBizOpps on or about July 18, 2006. The contract resultant from this RFP will provide the SSA be a nationwide VOiP enabled telephone network system. The contract will be an IDIQ vehicle and will have a total potential term of ten years. 
<P>
Advance notice of this project has been previously published at FedBizOpps through the posting of draft solicitation documents, inclusive of a draft Statement of Work and responses to contractor submitted requests for clarification. These documents were posted using Reference-Number-SSA-TSRP-(VOIP)-2006, and can be accessed at: <U>http://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference%2DNumber%2DSSA%2DTSRP%2D%28VOIP%29%2D2006/Synopsis.html</U>. Interested parties are encouraged to access these previous draft postings to familiarize themselves with the general requirements of the SSA under TSRP. Interested parties are, however, advised that the requirements that will be contained in the final RFP may differ from those previously released in draft form.
<P>
Interested parties are notified that the Interested Vendor List (IVL) functionality of the FedBizOpps website has been activated and are encouraged to use this and other means to identify and contact other potential teaming partners for this procurement. 
<P>
This notice is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for information. This notice is posted in accordance with FAR 5.204 to provide advance notice to interested parties of an upcoming solicitation from the Social Security Administration. Any information received in response to this notice will not be considered, and will be discarded.
<P>
<B>Synopsis of Requirements :</B>
<P>
The Social Security Administration (SSA) will replace its current Private Branch eXchange (PBX) telephony systems at specified sites with an Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony solution, to support current and future requirements and the transition to Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony, hereafter known as the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TRSP). The SSA’s current PBX systems have limitations that impact productivity, efficiency, and cost in completing the Agency’s mission.  In addition, there are concerns about the technical support for the existing PBX systems.  The target Enterprise VoIP architecture for the replacement system will utilize centralized call processing equipment located on Agency premises and several premise based systems, employing an Agency-provided data network infrastructure for transport.  This VoIP system architecture will provide greater functionality, interoperability, flexibility, survivability and a consolidated operational and management infrastructure.  It will be a robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure that will provide significant business value in the near term, and will best position the Agency for the future.  The solution will deliver a single logical system that will provide telephone, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Automated Attendant (AA), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and voicemail services across Agency’s Headquarters and Field Office organizations, including 10 regional offices, 6 Program Service Centers, and over 1500 Field Offices, to name a few.  
<P>
The TSRP solution will consist of contractor provided hardware, software, and professional services to install and integrate the TSRP solution with the SSA’s GFE, and remove the end of life telephony systems.  The GFE include the Agency’s Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) network infrastructure, and WAN and PSTN transport facilities and services. The Contractor will provide a migration path from the existing key system voice platform to support telephony and other voice communication sessions among people who are geographically dispersed though an innovative, comprehensive solution that combines, voice, video, and data applications on the Agency’s existing data network infrastructure. TSRP will also include a Contractor provided “Managed Services” component for addressing the management, control, administration and maintenance of the enterprise VoIP solution.  These services will entail close cooperation with the Agency’s current Information Technology (IT) groups, as well as the Agency’s GFE and provider(s).  
<P>
The upcoming TSRP solicitation will fully specify the following contractor provided supplies and services:
<P>
1.	Connectivity between hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment.
<P>
2.	A single logical telephony system for the Agency’s existing Field Offices. 
<P>
3.	Multiple single site telephony systems for some of the Agency’s large sites and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
<P>
4.	Specifications required to engineer, furnish, integrate, install, test, and place in service (cutover) the TSRP solution, as well as support of the System equipment.
<P>
5.	Training of government personnel.
<P>
6.	Ongoing on-site maintenance and management with trained and certified individuals.
<P>
7.	Removal and disposal of obsolete telephony equipment from the Agency’s offices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Office of AIDS Research(OAR intend to award a cost plus fixed fee level of effort contract for a one year base year with four one year option periods.  This will be done under full and open competition.  The OAR intends to recompete a contract to provide services that support the programs of the office.  The OAR is responsible for the scientific planning, budgetary, legislative, and policy elements of the NIH AIDS research program.  OAR promotes collaborative research in both national and international settings and is responsible for the development of an annual comprehensive plan and budget for all NIH AIDS research.  OAR supports? trans-NIH Coordinating Committees to advance these efforts in the following areas of program emphasis: Natural History and Epidemiology; Etiology and Pathogenesis; Therapeutics; Vaccines; Behavioral and Social Science; Racial and Ethnic Minorities; Training, Infrastructure, and Capacity Building; and Information Dissemination.  Services that will be required through this procurement will include, but are not limited to: A) Writing, Editorial, Production, and Document Preparation Support for large documents, visual aids, meeting materials, exhibits, and other products, most often on a quick turnaround basis.  Current and thorough knowledge of the science of AIDS, the NIH AIDS research program, and the activities of OAR are required. B) Technical Information Systems Support for electronic communications and dissemination of information using the Internet or other technology.  The Offeror will have the capability to design and maintain web sites, information kiosks, and other electronic media.  Collection and maintenance of information resources in an automated manner will be required, as will the development of an easy-to-use database system for tracking information on people and events.  Software support and training capabilities are sometimes required. Successful demonstration of the capability to bring all the skills necessary to satellite broadcast an event from an international location to several sites must be presented.  The Offeror shall also have the capability to produce videos from concept through all phases of production through distribution.  C) Analysis Support for literature searches, analysis/synthesis of data, drafting issues papers on topics from science to policy, development of strategies for information dissemination, and program evaluation.  D) National and International Meeting and Conference Support from planning, budgeting, identification of presenters and participants, agenda development, logistical arrangements, travel and expense reimbursement, contract negotiations, development and dissemination of briefing materials, onsite materials, and post meeting information, correspondence and tracking and production of documentation.  Due to the levels of funding and staffing, the requirement to have relevant experience working with high profile individuals and subject matter, the requirements for quick response and error-free deliverables, special requirements have been established for potential offerors.  Many of the activities and services for OAR are integrated so any teaming arrangements must demonstrate how the staffing will appear seamless to OAR. The special requirements include: 1)To assure rapid response to changing program needs and to assure adequate day-to-day management of multiple complex activities that must be conducted in close concert with activities of OAR staff, other NIH institutes or Federal agencies, and other contractors, the project staff of the successful Offeror (and subcontractors, if any) must be available to meet with OAR program staff in Bethesda, Maryland, with as little as 2 hours? advance notice. Such meetings on any given day will involve one or more members of the Offeror's team representing different areas of service.  2)The Offeror shall have sufficient staff so that the Project Officer can develop a long-term working relationship with the same individual or individuals over the life of the contract to maintain continuity in the delivery of services.  The available staff must be extensive and flexible enough to staff up to 43 FTEs in one month and then cut back to 8 FTEs a few months later to accommodate fluctuations in work volume and type.  There must be an adequate depth of staff to allow projects to be staffed and begin without delay.  It is important that the Offeror have a plan for maintaining trained staff with experience working with the OAR that can be accessible when required, but not be billable to the project during periods of minimal activity.  3) The Offeror will assist, often under tight deadlines, with the development of issue papers, briefing books, research papers, summary reports, etc., regarding the mission of the OAR, programs underway, budget, and other substantive issues.  Analytical and editorial staff must have a thorough knowledge of HIV/AIDS research issues and familiarity with resources for quickly compiling current data.  The Offeror must have a plan for making individuals with this knowledge available upon very short notice.  4) OAR is a top-level, policy making office in which NIH staff work under considerable pressure to carry out the office?s mission through its various programs and activities, as well as respond to high level requests for information regarding the AIDS research program at NIH.  The Director is frequently called on to make presentations or give testimony to Congress regarding budget appropriations for AIDS research or to discuss progress being made in the NIH AIDS research program.  These activities challenge OAR program staff to efficiently assemble appropriate data for presentations.  Schedules that are set up are nonnegotiable, frequently with stringent deadlines.  Offeror staff must be prepared to react competently to these quick turnaround requirements by compiling documentation into briefing books, summary reports, presentation materials, etc.  The Offeror must be able to interact efficiently with OAR staff and quickly turn around materials that will not be able to be able to go back and forth by fax or electronic copy for review and revision cycles (e.g., enlargements, color, visual aids, final copies, etc.).  The Offeror should have adequate facilities, with back up staff and equipment, to produce materials, often overnight, without delay. A Offeror location within close proximity of the NIH campus facilitates communication and work flow, maximizes Offeror and client resources, and conserves costs.  5) OAR serves as the lead agency representing NIH?s AIDS research effort nationally and internationally so its documents and communications are distributed widely with target audiences including the Congress of the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services, other Executive Branch Departments, the medical and scientific research communities and the public.  All materials and services delivered to OAR must be provided in a timely and accurate manner and all materials leaving OAR must be error-free and received by the proper audiences.  Offeror staff will interact with individuals from the highest levels of the U.S. and foreign governments, community groups and advocates, scientists and medical professionals and HIV+ individuals regarding highly sensitive subject matter.  Offerors must demonstrate experience working in a highly sensitive and confidential environment successfully.  6) The Offeror must have experience working throughout the United States and internationally.  Offeror staff may be called upon to work with VIPs from the U.S. and other countries.  The Offeror should demonstrate experience with high level arrangements including briefings on protocol and cultural issues, security, required documentation, etc.  7) The Offeror shall demonstrate knowledge and understanding of travel arrangements and requirements in and out of the United States according to the Federal Travel Regulations.  8) The Offeror will be required to make payments, upon approval of the Project Officer, to organizers of collaborative or supported events; to pay vendors for products and services required for conferences or other activities and to reimburse meeting participants for expenses and honoraria.  Offerors must demonstrate the ability to make payments without delay and expend as much as $4 million over a 2 month period under standard reimbursement procedures from the Government.  

The RFP is anticipated for release on or about November 22, 2006.  The RFP, RFP amendments, and questions and answers related to this procurement shall be available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Offerors are responsible for accessing the website.  At this time no written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and list of bidders shall be maintained.

<DESC>****Due date for responses to this RFI has changed from 1 Nov 06 to 20 Nov 06.

Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Reduction (AHNR) system designed to integrate with the HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P flight helmets. Responses to this RFI are due no later than 20 Nov 2006.

1.0 DESCRIPTION

The 648 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) is seeking feedback on the Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the Draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and the Final Performance Specification for AHNR. The AHNR is an integrated helmet noise reduction system which will effectively reduce noise in all phases of flight in multiple platforms and crew positions that require use of the Air Force HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P helmets.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

- Will the purposed systems be able to use existing communication testers (MQ-1, Scot, and Manside testers) to perform required inspections on the AHNR
- Is SOW paragraph 3.2.10, windblast requirement, clearly defined
- Is SOW paragraph 3.2.11, training requirements, clearly defined
- Is the Air Force going to need any additional data (other than that listed in 3.2.11) in order to train personnel to use this system
- Are the CDRLs reasonable as far as delivery time and delivery requirements
- Is the period of performance accurate for delivery of production representative units, can it be shorten?
- If awarded as a fixed price contract, give project milestones for invoicing/payment schedule

2.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to open a dialogue with industry and other communities of interest, to ensure to the maximum extent possible that industry input and comments are given proper and due consideration in development of the Air Force AHNR. The RFI is also expected to help 648 AESS/TA to complete indicative costing of the AHNR solution.

This RFI is for planning purposes only, and there is no intention to award any contract based on this RFI. The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI. An appropriate Request for Proposal (RFP) process may follow at the appropriate time, but is not necessarily linked directly to the questions and responses generated in this RFI.

3.0 CAPABILITIES SOUGHT

The topics for responses set out the information on concepts and designs that 648 AESS/TA is seeking in relation to the AHNR approach and scope of this RFI. Generated requirements are listed in the referenced Draft SOW. Note that these requirements are in Draft only. To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0 RESPONSE GUIDANCE

Respondents to this RFI should submit documents via email to both of the POCs listed in section 7.0 of this RFI. In the response, please reference specific sections in the Draft SOW and Draft CDRLs by number, with the comments and evaluation of that particular section following. Submitted responses should be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format.

5.0 INFORMATION APPROACH

When the responses to this RFI are received, they will be evaluated and analyzed by the Government. The information received will be considered in the development of the next proposed design, and may serve as input to a business case.

Based on industry responses, 648 AESS/TA intends to modify/update the SOW and CDRLs as necessary. In all cases pertaining to this RFI, the Government will take absolute care not to present information outside of the Government in a way that clearly identifies individual vendors or products.

6.0 DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Orion Heat Transfer and Aerodynamic Testing which was posted on October 30, 2006. You are notified that following changes are made:  The Description is deleted and replaced with the following: ARC is requesting a continuation of testing services and reports to support NASA's Orion Aerosciences Project. These tests are required to provide real gas laminar and turbulent heat transfer data for the Orion flight aerothermodynamic database. The data will also be used to validate the CFD codes used to generate the flight databases. This is a continuation of testing activities currently performed under contract NNA06BA17P with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) of Pasadena, CA. Currently, laminar heat transfer data is being obtained in Caltech’s T5 shock tunnel facility. There is a need to obtain corresponding turbulent heat transfer data from the same facility in order to determine the amount of heat transfer augmentation due to turbulence.  The services required are: 1) Perform at least 50 tests on a scale model in a high enthalpy (between 10 and 20 MJ/kg) flow field with a range of reservoir pressures between 20 and 70 MPa. Vendor is required to provide a model to support the testing. The model must include provisions to trip the boundary layer to ensure turbulent flow on the spherical section of the model. There must also be provisions to roughen the model surface and obtain turbulent heat transfer data on the roughened model. The model will be a blunt-body geometry similar to the Apollo capsule. The model must be a minimum 6 inches in diameter. The exact geometry for the model will be provided to the vendor by the Government after award is made; 2) Provide laminar and turbulent heat transfer data with uncertainty estimates for the range of enthalpies and reservoir pressures (above) at a minimum of 100 locations on the model; 3) Provide facility calibration data for all test conditions consisting of pitot pressure and heat transfer data at a minimum of 5 radial locations at the axial location of the model;  4)  Provide a quick look data report and final test report of the results.	 Include error bars and uncertainty estimates in the reports; and 5) Provide access to the facility, and insight into data collection procedures and data reduction processes during testing, including access to all raw data traces.  Deliveries to NASA ARC are required as follows:  1) Provide model design drawings no later than Feb. 28, 2007.  2) Preliminary pitot pressure and heat transfer calibration data no later than May 15, 2007. 3) A quick look data report no later than July 15, 2007 that includes heat transfer with error bars and facility operating conditions for all shots completed to that date.  4) A final test report no later than September 15, 2007 that includes the complete set of heat transfer data with error bars, flow field images, assessment of turbulent transition and facility operating conditions.      NASA/ARC intends to modify the current contract for testing and analysis services with the California Institute of Technology. Caltech’s T5 shock tunnel facility and testing and analysis team has the capability to meet all of the test requirements. The research team, under Professor Hans Hornung, has a great deal of expertise in the field of hypersonics and high enthalpy test facilities. Caltech's T5 shock tunnel has produced high quality heat transfer data for a range of Department of Defense, NASA, and industrial customers for over 15 years.     The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(a)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Based on NASA's market survey, Caltech is the only source capable of fulfilling the requirements, given the schedule constraints and the need for close coordination with ARC.     The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.     Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 13, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.     Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.     All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.     An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".     Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.  The due date for responses is extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/ARC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The Government intends to award an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract for COMNAVSURFLANT Norfolk, Virginia, with use by COMNAVAIRLANT and COMNAVSUBLANT as 100% small business set aside.  Multiple award contracts may result from this competition.  Successful contractors shall be required to competitively propose on each requirement.  Subsequent delivery orders will be definitized and awarded with firm fixed unit prices.  Due to the complexity of services required, the government intends to award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government from a past performance, technical, and price proposal standpoint.  This acquisition is for the delivery of renovated habitability spaces aboard various US Naval Ships. These spaces will be identified by the individual ships and may include, but are not limited to heads, berthing compartments, staterooms, offices, lounges, ship store, barber shop, galley,mess areas,wardrooms, supply storage area, library, chapel, and others. Renovations may include, but are not limited to, overheads, decks, bulkheads, furniture, rearrangements, new arrangements, fabrication of shipboard furniture and installations, and removals.

This office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations.  By submitting a proposal, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Lack of registration in the CCR database as required by FAR 4.1102 will make an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling

<CONTACT>gayna.c.malcolm, 703-695-2564
<DESC>Question and Answers for W91WAW-07-R-JAMR 1.	Could you please let me know the names of the companies who did the previous, or are doing current, advertising work for DoD recruiting and retention? Answer:  Currently, the work on this contract is being performed by Mullen Advertising.  I do not have access to all of DoDs contracts. 2.	There seems to be two different solicitation numbers that have come out for this request and I would like to verify which one you would like us to respond to?  The original solicitation number we were responding to was W91WAW-07-R-JAMR dated 10/18.  The n on 10/27 a new notice came out with what appears to be the same information and Performance Work Statement, but solicitation number USA-SNOTE-061027-001.  Please verify which solicitation number is correct and if indeed anything has changed in the PWS? Answer: You may respond to both if you like.  The description on W91WAW-07-R-JAMR clearly state this is a sources sought/market survey being conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)10.001 to determine the extent of small busine ss capabilities in performing the requirement for procuring services for a full-service marketing communications agency.  The description on USA-SNOTE-061027-001 state this is a request for information only to solicit information in accordance with the Fed eral Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) to allow the private sector the opportunity to provide an innovative, end-to-end (not piecemeal) solution for a full-service marketing communications agency. 3.  The links are not operating to obtain the draft copy of the Performance Work Statement from the following web site: http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.  If possible can you direct me to another web site? Answer: You must first register before access can be granted.  Once registered, if you are still experiencing problems accessing the site, click on the contact us tab for assistance.   4.  I was wondering if there is an incumbent contractor, or if this is a new requirement? If it's a new requirement a simple 'no incumbent' would be a big help. Otherwise, if you can provide me any of the following information I'd really appreciate it:  -Contractor name, Contract #, Award date, contract type, duration, max. value of contract  Answer: Incumbent contractor-Mullen Advertising, Contract number-DASW01-02-D-0002, Award date-January 28, 2002, Contract type-Fixed Price, Duration-base plus 4 options, max value-$90M 5.	What is the page limit for the solicitation? Answer: There is no page limitation 6.	What is the PWS? Answer: PWS is Performance Work Statement.  See part 2 (Definitions &  Acronyms) for the definition. 7.  How do I submit our information as requested in this posting? Also - place of performance - are you looking for an on-site contractor(s)? Answer: The description clearly state: Capability packages shall be delivered using one of the following methods: E-MAIL to gayna.malcolm@hqda.army.mil or EXPRESS MAIL:  Packages submitted by express mail services (e.g. Federal Express, United Parcel Servi ce, DHL, etc.) shall be submitted to Contracting Center Of Excellence, Attn: Gayna C. Malcolm-Packnett, Rm 1C256, 5200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-5200. Section 1.5.5 of the PWS state the contractors worksite must be geographically located not be more than 3.5 hours from the JAMRS office in Arlington, VA.  8.  I understand that this is a new requirement, but can you please tell me if the tasks associated with this offering are currently being performed by government employees or by several contracting agencies. Answer:  See answer to question 1 9.	Will the government accept, for the purposes of this Sources Sought Notice, proposed small business teams whose combined past performance and current individual specialties satisfy the capabilities evaluation criteria? Answer: Yes Also, will the government accept r esponses from individual small businesses with expertise in only a segment of the capabilities evaluation criteria? Answer: No Additional questions shall be submitted electronically to Gayna Malcolm-Packnett, Contracting Center of Excellence-Washington by email at Gayna.Malcolm@hqda.army.mil referencing W91WAW-07-R-JAMR by 1:00pm on 2 Nov 2006. Questions will be answered by an ame ndment.

A prototype Quantitative Spatial Imaging System has been designed and built by BEA to demonstrate a means of conducting physical spatial calibration in video images at reduced cost and increased accuracy of spatial measurement.  There has been a need to make improvements to identify, stabilize, clean, and decommission underground piping. The majority of pipe, at most decontamination and decommissioning projects, is less than six inches in diameter and much of it remains under existing buildings.  Initial testing was performed in a four (4) inch diameter pipe and yielded approximately five percent (5%) error in spatial measurements.  This prototype unit utilizes ten co-linear laser beams created by miniaturized laser diodes with integrated optics aligned perpendicular to one another with 5 beams on the X axis and 5 beams on the Y axis. These ten lasers produced a fiduciary matrix at the camera lens? focal length, thereby creating reference points used to obtain a calibrated spatial map over the entire image. These points remain constant regardless of camera type, aspect ratio, lens configuration, focal length or magnification, provided the region of interest is in focus on the computer screen.

This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BEA or the DOE. This solicitation will close to responses 60 days after publication. Interested parties should send a description of their company and their experience in commercializing new technologies to the following address: Gary W. Smith, Sr. Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, Battelle Energy Alliance, P. O. Box 1625, MS 3805 Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805; E-mail is gary.smith@inl.gov

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Rebecca Bizier at rebecca_bizier@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646 within 15 days of posting. Project Description:  Sounds associated with aircraft overflights (air tours, general aircraft (GA) and military operations, and high altitude commercial jet aircraft (HA) are an important management concern at Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP).  In 1987, the National Parks Overflight Act (P.L. 100-91) was passed requiring the National Park Service (NPS) and the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to work together to achieve substantial restoration of the natural quite in GCNP. The goal of this project is to conduct acoustic sound monitoring, sound data collection, and analysis of natural sounds and human produce noise.  This would entail an acoustic characterization of remote backcountry areas, two developed areas of the park, and several transitional areas of the south and north rim of GCNP.  Work conducted will be sufficient to support noise modeling efforts related to aircraft overflights and river rafting activity; and provide analysis and documentation of sound data collected by and for the National Park Service at Grand Canyon National Park. Title of Project: Sound Data Collection and Analysis, Noise Inventory and Overflights Monitoring Location: Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona - North and South Rims Type of Procurement: A Small Business set aside is anticipated.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Industry Day announcement.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully support a potential VH-71 Performance Based Logistics (PBL) product support strategy, and to exchange ideas with industry on how to best implement the VH-71 PBL program.

The VH-71 will replace the existing fleet of Presidential Helicopters (VH-60s and VH-3s) and will provide a variety of missions in accordance with White House Military Office (WHMO) requirements. The VH-71 will be supported by the Marine Corps' existing maintenance procedures to include Organizational to Depot two-level maintenance concept.  The current supply system shall be utilized unless a Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) recommends a more efficient, cost-effective method that maintains the same level of security as the current maintenance and supply system.  The system shall use common tools and general-purpose test equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The support and development concepts shall include the capability to operate from commercial airports (CONUS/OCONUS), military airfield (CONUS/OCONUS), and austere sites throughout the world.

PBL support is being considered for the VH-71 fleet to provide a more cost-effective readiness solution.  PBL is a support strategy that places emphasis on meeting the needs of the Presidential Helicopter fleet to project the most cost-effective solution with an acceptable amount of risk.  Its primary tenets are to meet HMX-1 requirements system availability and reliability.  PBL should be used as a form of sustainment to meet the operational requirements the right aircraft, in the right configuration, in the right place, at the right time.  Furthermore, the PBL support should resolve obsolescence issues, and find ways to integrate support solutions.  To implement a successful PBL contract, the contractor must be able to exhibit the capability to: 1) improve inherent design reliability; 2) establish and execute Lean processes; and 3) reduce cost.  The outcome of this activity is expected to result in improving overall life-cycle management of system availability, reliability, supportability, and total ownership costs.

The VH-71 program intends to engage with industry in an ALPHA process where there is a collaborative discussion between the government and the contractor.  Using this process, the government will define the requirement(s) and metric(s).  We are looking for industry PBL approaches that address all of the following areas:
General Contracting Approach/Strategy to include recommendations regarding; Contract Relationships:  traditional prime/sub, thin prime/sub, joint venture, public/private teaming and/or sub-contractor contractual relationships that encourage flow-down of PBL concepts and incentives; Contract Type and Length; Payment structure: Metrics:  NMC, system reliability and system availability; Information Technology:  established bidder's infrastructure; familiarity with, and access to systems such as:  NMCI, OOMA, e-mall, etc.  Sustaining Engineering to include inherent reliability improvements; development of changes/modifications; failure analysis; and maintenance engineering support of all three levels of maintenance.  Supply Chain Management to include the management of actions, procedures, and techniques necessary to determine requirements; to acquire, document, receive, store, transfer, issue and dispose of spares, repair parts, and supplies; provide Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation; comply with Unique Identification; and manage Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages/Obsolescence within a closed loop environment.  Maintenance to include approaches and experience in maintaining aircraft and associated components.  Industry should explicitly address their approach to satisfy Title 10 requirements.  Tech Support to include approach for providing on-site technical support. Support Equipment (peculiar and common) to include approach for management of all support equipment (hardware & software) that will be required for the operation and maintenance of the aircraft.  Training?to include all the appropriate processes, procedures, techniques, training devices, and equipment used to train flight crew, to include O and D level maintenance personnel, to operate and support a system.  Technical Data/Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs)?to include approach for management of technical data (i.e. technical maintenance and operator manuals, engineering drawings, and supporting graphics) in addition to the implementation of a long-range requirement to develop, deploy, and IETMs.  Configuration Management to include the approach for documenting the configuration of each aircraft/system/component.  Exit Criteria?to include approaches which will allow the government to continue sustainment in the event the contractor should fail to perform, or, does not negotiate in good faith at the end of the contract.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 336411.  The information presented in this announcement will not obligate the government in any manner.  All prospective offerors are encouraged to respond to this synopsis electronically to Ms. Angie Nelson, angela.nelson1@navy.mil and Mrs. Dawn Adamo, dawn.adamo@navy.mil.  The response shall include: Business name and address, cage code, business size, and a point of contact.  Interested parties are also requested to submit information outlining the company's capabilities and past performance with this type of service.  The submission shall not exceed twenty pages and are requested no later than 15 November 2006. Once responses are received, interested parties may be requested to provide a presentation to further describe their capabilities and allow an opportunity to exchange ideas on how to best provide cost-effective performance based outcomes for the VH-71. In addition, NAVAIR will be hosting an Industry Day on 27-28 November 2006 at Southern Maryland Higher Education Center to further support NAVAIR?s requirement.  Parties interested in attending shall contact the point of contact below as space is limited to two representatives per company.  Numbered Note 25

<DESC>National Security Technologies LLC is looking for sources for:

A six-channel time gated MCP detector. This pulser system will consist of six pulser modules, a control module, a trigger module and a power supply module integrated into a single 19" rack mounting enclosure. Each pulser module will have an integrated delay generator and bias voltage generator and will have a high level trigger input. In addition it will have a low voltage DC power supply input and a control interface all derived from a common backplane in the 19" rack. 

The system will always require one control module, one trigger module and one power supply module, but will be capable of operating with a minimum of one and a maximum of nine pulser modules. 
The unformed output of each pulser module will be a negative step of approximately 6kV with approximately 100ps risetime and a slower, approximate exponential decay. Each pulser module output will be manually fitted with a pulse-forming module (PFM). 
The negative output pulse voltage from a PFM will be nominally > or = to 3.0 KV into 50 ohm with a pulse duration that can be specified in the range 300 ps to 1000ps FWHM. The waveform of the pulse will be either a Gaussian or nearly square wave with a rise time less than 150 ps and falling edge less than 250 ps. A power indicator light should show that AC power is applied and the unit is switched on, and a triggered indicator should illuminate while the unit is being triggered.     The trigger module will take a single low level trigger input and will produce nine high level trigger outputs that will be distributed approximately synchronously to each of the 9 pulser module slots.     

The above is a partial specification, Interested parties are to demonstrate that they have the capability to provide similar products.     Also provide your business size based on NAICS code of 500 employees.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Office for Grants and Training (G&T) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of portable loudspeakers (LDSPKR) used with SCBA and APR to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by first responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.

G&T?s Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is inviting manufacturers to provide information on man-carried portable loudspeakers used to guide the public through the decontamination corridor during evacuation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 8.1.4. The requested information will be included in the LDSPKR equipment market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP LDSPKR focus group and assessment. Information provided by manufacturers on LDSPKR equipment and/or technologies, including photos, may also be included in the LDSPKR market survey report.

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of responder disciplines in agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The assessment evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment as a responder [wearing Class 1, 2 or 3 personal protective equipment (PPE)]. The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please submit, in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone and fax numbers, web address, email address and equipment photos. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments while wearing Class 1, 2 or 3 PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research, and new developments. Also, please include cost information such as initial costs, replacement parts, accessory options, and available warranties.

Do not send your piece of equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/supplies as the equipment is chosen for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00 p.m. CST on Wednesday, November 15, 2006. Responses may be submitted by e-mail to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov ; by fax to (256) 847-2323, attention Charlotte Laughlin; or by mail to Charlotte Laughlin, Contract Specialist, Center for Domestic Preparedness, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL 36205.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement and is for informational purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is requesting information on availability of services to upgrade cont rol systems on two Mobile Dynamometers.  1.0 Summary The US Army Aberdeen Test Centers (ATC) Automotive Instrumentation Division operates two special purpose Dynamometer vehicles. They referred to as the M16 Heavy Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle (manufactured by Barnes and Reinecke in the late 1970s) and the M1 8 Medium Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle (manufactured, also by Barnes and Reinecke, in the late 1980s).  These vehicles are designed for testing power drawbar effect and resistance to towing characteristics of tracked and wheeled vehicles. Testing apparatus for determining component cooling characteristics of these vehicle types is also included on these vehi cles. Both vehicles utilize a diesel engine-powered electric drive system. ATC desires to upgrade the engine/drive control systems on both systems to current technology reusing the existing vehicle frame and major components. The upgraded systems will support al l the existing modes of operation with the desired addition of a constant power mode. The M16 and M18 dynamometers are presently in service at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (APG) and can be inspected by prospective bidders. The following sections outline the current systems which are similar as far as chassis but have different engines,  traction motors, and control systems. It is desired that the upgraded control systems be as similar as possible. 2.0 Major Vehicle Subsystems (Current Implementation) 2.0.1	Power Package 2.0.1.1	M16  Heavy Dynamometer The M16 dynamometer power package is based upon a GM-EMD, model EMD8-645E4 turbocharged diesel engine (1650 hp) coupled to a GM-EMD, model AR5, 3-phase AC current generator. The power developed drives two GM-EMD, model D79-F series wound, four-pole, direct  current traction motors. 2.0.1.2	M18  Medium Dynamometer The M18 dynamometer power package is based upon a Cummins, model KTA-19P600 turbocharged diesel engine (600 hp) coupled to a GE, model 603, 3-phase AC current generator. The power developed drives one GE, model 5GE773DS2 series wound, four-pole, direct cur rent traction motor. 2.1.1	Current Vehicle Operational Modes There are three primary operating modes: prime mover, dynamometer, and truck. Also there are two auxiliary modes: inch and winch. Prime Mover Mode  The traction motor(s) function as electric drive motor(s) and the propulsion of the vehicle is taking place. In this mode, a speed-setting potentiometer creates the demand for more or less propulsion. The control system will increase or decrease the vehicle speed until the actual speed matches the desired speed. At any time, the brake pedal can override this system can call for maximum dynamic braking. Dynamometer Mode  The traction motor(s) function as generator(s) with its output across the dynamic retarding grid resistors. In this mode the vehicle becomes a dynamic load to any vehicle that is trying to tow it at a constant speed. The level of the ret arding load is a function of the brake pedal position or the speed-setting potentiometer. The speed control system will initiate more or less retarding in order to maintain the speed desired by altering the traction motor field current. At any time, the br ake pedal can override this system and call for maximum dynamic braking. Truck Mode  The electric speed control is taken out of the system. The vehicle speed is controlled by the accelerator foot pedal and functions similar to any hybrid electric vehicle. Dynamic braking can still occur by pressing the brake foot pedal. Truck mode operation is generally used to move the vehicle to and from test sites. Inch Mode  Similar to truck mode where the vehicle speed is controlled via the accelerator pedal . It is different in that (1) it is a very fine control in the low speed range; (2) the horsepower card (General Electric 1466, M18 only) is driven directly by the accelerator foot pedal, whereas in the primary Truck mode it is not; and (3) inch mode all ows the driver more accurate control of the vehicle when coupling to other vehicles, hooking up tow bars, etc. Before inch mode can occur, the mode select switch must be in truck mode. Winch Mode  identical to inch mode with the exception that a 10K potentiometer drives the GE 1466 horsepower control card (M18 only) and much finer control is achieved. Static Line Pulls  The front load cells may be retracted using its hydraulic cylinder, to apply static line pulls and read the tension load with the dynamometer parked. Extending the load cell will remove the load. 3.0	Updated Control Systems It is desired that to the greatest extent possible the new control systems will reuse the prime mover, generator, traction motor, auxiliary power unit and dynamic braking grid. Other secondary elements such as heating/air conditioning, defroster are not ex pected to require any modification other than if required for control purposes. It is desired that both the M16 and M18 use common control components to the greatest extent possible. Operational modes will remain consistent with modes supported by the current systems with the addition of a constant load input to the speed control servo when operated in dynamometer mode. It is anticipated that the new control system will replace the current contactors, relays, sensors, displays and associated wiring. ATC envisions that the new control system will include discrete switches, encoders, and LCD touch screens as required. Opera tional data will be logged by the system and must be made available to the operators in a serial data format similar to either J1708 or J1939. 4.0  Built-in Testing/System Debugging The system will provide built-in testing and troubleshooting tools to assist in testing and debugging system faults.  4.1	Special Test Equipment Any special test equipment required for testing and troubleshooting the system shall be identified. Pricing and sourcing information shall be identified. 4.2	Documentation The system will be fully documented to include wiring diagrams, schematics, parts lists, source code, and purchase sources for all components. Any special tools will be identified. A theory of operation document shall be provided to assist engineers in und erstanding system operation and a set of troubleshooting instructions will be provided. 4.3	Recommended Spares The system will have a list of recommended spares provided 5.0  Notes: The current M18 dynamometer was designed by Barnes and Reinecke, Inc. to provide tractive effort (prime mover mode) and absorbtion capacities (dynamometer mode) per specifications provided by APG. The paper Mobile Dynamometer and Absorption Trailer for Military Vehicles was written by Wasynczuk and Landes (1987) describing the performance evaluation and testing of the M18 as it was delivered to ATC.  Wasynczuk V. & Landes L. G. (1987). Mobile dynamometer and absorption trailer for military vehicles. SAE Technical Paper Series, 871600, International Off-Highway and Powerplant Congress and Exposition, Milwaukee, WI, September 14-17, 1987 6.0 More Information Active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database is mandatory.  Companies capable of providing this repair service upgrade are encouraged to respond.  Please provide company name, points of contact, and a brief statement of capabil ities.  Indicate corporate background with business size and type.  Submit information via electronic mail or fax by November 16, 2006 no later than 5:00 PM EST at the US Army Contracting Agency, SFCA-NR-APC-T (Tanya Peel), 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdee n Proving Ground, MD  21005-3013.

<SUBJECT>BAA 07 001 for Cooperative Agreement- Energetic Systems Development; workforce revitalization; and strategic policy analysis.
<DESC>The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center, in collaboration with the Naval Sea Systems Command, has an interest in proposals related to Energetic Systems Development; workforce revitalization; and strategic policy analysis.  Specific areas of interest are: research on  all types of energetic materials, explosives and propellants processing with an emphasis on continuous processing and lean manufacturing, explosive components and warhead technology; synthesis of new materials; formulation of new explosives and propellants; scale up studies of new formulations; development of technology base in applied mechanics to assess the damage to underwater targets from advanced underwater warheads; novel concepts in the areas of Micro Electronic Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) and comparable technologies; development of concepts for new ignition devices; development of new warhead technologies for all types of weapons; development of new and innovative technologies in the a!  rea of demil and disposal of energetic materials; studies on explosive and propellant devices in areas of chemistry, physics and engineering; modeling and simulation in all of the above areas of interest; use of virtual environments for design, simulation and prototyping; knowledge-based tool development for design, information management, analysis, and quality control; virtual use  and development of virtual reality approaches such as CAVES (Computer-Assisted Virtual Environments) and head-mounted devices for training and expert information capture; energetic concepts for counterterrorism, underwater mines, torpedoes, mine neutralization, defeat, improvised explosive device defeat and Seal weapons; theoretical and experimental research on the effects of chemical and nuclear explosions in air, water and ground media and other energetics technical studies.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to accomplish the goals contained in this Broad Agency A!  nnouncement (BAA) through the issuance of Cooperative Agreements under  the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2358.  Cooperative agreements are assistance instruments that will help to facilitate:  (a) a close working relationship between Indian Head and the recipient(s), (b) the exchange of personnel and maximum use of available facilities, (c) an environment for the exchange of scientific ideas, and (d) the conduct of research in support of Navy requirements while encouraging commercialization of the results of the research.  The Cooperative Agreement will allow for substantial programmatic involvement in the form of Indian Head Technologists’ participation in decisions related to objectives.  Proposals that involve final product development beyond the stage of product prototype or feasibility demonstration are outside the scope of the competition and will not be acceptable.  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare Indian Head's intent to competitively fund (offerors must propose cost sharing) research and technolog!  y projects and that no request for proposals, solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  This notice constitutes Indian Head's BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Teaming arrangements among participants are encouraged when the result is a technically stronger proposal.  Due to limited funding, the Government reserves the right to limit awards under this announcement and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded.  All work performed under cooperative agreements resulting from this BAA must be performed within the United States.  Proposals including work or research that will be performed outside of the United States, in whole or in any part, are not acceptable and will disqualify the entire proposal from further consideration.  Cooperative agreements awarded as a result of this BAA maybe for a period of up to five (5) years.  It is intended that the Government will assess the progress of the effort during each year.  Ba!  sed on this assessment, the Government will decide whether to continue  funding the cooperative agreement.  In accordance with OMB Circular A 110, proposed cooperative agreements shall not provide for payment of fee or profit.  Proposals containing provisions for payment of fee or profit will not be considered.  Any interested offeror should send five (5) copies of its technical and cost proposal to: Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center, ATTN: Mr. Edward Rogan, Code C13E, Bldg. 1558, 101 Strauss Avenue, Indian Head, MD 20640 5035.  To be considered for award, Indian Head must receive the full proposal by 20 March 2008. Any interested company or institution is encouraged, but not required, to submit a white paper synopsis of the planned proposal including a rough cost estimate.  White papers should address the selection criteria wherever possible.  The white paper, if submitted, should not exceed five (5) pages and must be submitted by no later than 1 November 2007.  The white paper may be faxed to (301) 744 6670 or delivered to the office identified in the previous paragraph.  Those submitting white papers are encouraged to continue to work on drafting a full proposal during the white paper evaluation process.  It is expected that Indian Head technical review will be complete within 1 month of white paper receipt.  The Grants Officer will contact the white paper submitter and provide feedback on the Navy's level of interest in the proposed project.  Based upon the degree of encouragement received, companies and institutions can better decide whether to continue the preparation of full tech!  nical and cost proposals for the described project.  Offerors may submit full proposals without going through the white paper process.  Proposals submitted under this BAA could be considered for award at anytime up to 24 months after the closing date of the announcement dependent upon the availability of funds.  Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated as they arrive.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria:  1)  Overall Technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific and technical merit of the proposed approach and its completeness, including: offeror’s grasp of technical challenges and appropriateness of possible solutions: the breadth, and variety of the proposed strategies; the  relevance, expected likelihood of success and of timely completion and proposed risk reduction activities; the clarity and soundness of proposed SOW, including responsiveness to the BAA. 2) The potential relationship of the proposed research and development to Department of Navy missions in relation to the scope of the BAA.  Proposal must indicate how the work to be performed will have an impact on naval capabilities, especially those impacting future naval systems.  Included in this element is how the proposal will help to develop the next generation of subject matter experts working on Department of Navy technical matters within the scope of this BAA.  3) The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, and facilities, including the  qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator(s), team  leader and other key personnel who are critical for achieving the proposed objectives. Offerors must demonstrate capabilities to perform cutting edge science and technology  programs, and demonstrate availability of a wide variety of subject matter expertise with  personnel that are on staff and capable of fully participating in proposed projects.

A demonstration that the resources available for the proposed activity, including facilities, equipment, and technical support, are necessary and sufficient to accomplish the objectives. Special attention should be paid to describing the necessity of any resources, which are proposed as part of the offeror's cost sharing.  5. A discussion of how intellectual property (especially that proposed as part of the offeror's cost sharing) is to be used as a necessary resource to accomplish the objectives of the project.  B. - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL The proposal shall contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed, by element of cost, for meaningful evaluation.  The estimate must include the total cost of the project and the amount and source of project funding (e.g., funds requested from Indian Head and/or funds to be provided by the proposing organization as cost sharing).  The offeror's cost share may take the form of academic training (such as Distance Learning and On-Campus Courses), equipment or access to unique facilities, independent research and development (IR&D), cash, foregone intellectual property rights, and other acceptable forms of in-kind contributions. (Note:   Work breakdown structures are neither required nor desired).  Cost/funding proposals should be organized to include four sections in the following order: total project cost, cost sharing and in kind contributions, and cost to the Government.  Section 1   Total Project Cost: This section will give a breakdown of costs of the project.  Cost should also be broken down on a task by task basis for each task appearing in the statement of work.  This should include all of the proposed cost to the Government and cost sharing by the offeror.  The following information should be presented in your proposal for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase, total offeror cost share; funding requested from the Government: and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money).  Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market value of leased items, and the method used for marking such evaluations.  Profit shall not be included as a cost element.   Section 2   Cost Sharing and In Kind Contributions: This section will include (1) the specific in kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; (2) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements;   (Note:  just put in-kind contribution prior to cash, hoping to send a message to potential offerors)   and (3) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash or in-kind contribution in the future.  Affirmative, signed agreements are required from outside sources of cash.  Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the sources of the offeror's cost share so that the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources may make a determination.  For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort?  What is the role of any proposed in kind contributions? Section 3   Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any required to support these activities.  The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort that is not covered by cost sharing The costs incurred and work performed by any DOD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost sharing requirement.  Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made.   Proposal shall also list any Defense Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA) information – recent audits, auditor point of contract, etc. C. PROPOSAL PAGE FORMATS All proposals should be printed such that pages are single sided, with no more than fifty five (55) lines per page.  Use 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8 1/2" x 11") paper or A4 metric paper.  Use an easy to read font or not more than about 5 characters per cm (fixed pitch font of 12 or fewer characters per inch or proportional font of point size 10 or larger).  Smaller type may be used in figures and tables, but must be clearly legible.  Margins on all sides (top, bottom, left and right) should be at least 2.5 cm.  (1"). E. OTHER REQUIREMENTS – Offerors proposing to conduct classified work in response to this BAA must have or be able to obtain prior to the classified work, all required personnel/facility clearances.

<SUBJECT>B -- NAVAIR Test and Evaluation Facilities Request for Information
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ? MARKEY RESEARCH SURVEY

The Department of the Navy proposes to conduct a competitive sourcing study of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) Test and Evaluation Facilities and has commenced preliminary planning in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.   The Naval Air Warfare Center?s Aircraft and Weapons Divisions are located at Patuxent River, MD; China Lake, CA; and Pt. Mugu, CA.
  
The Department of the Navy is conducting market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services, ascertain if there are any small businesses that are potentially capable of performing the entire function, and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units in providing aircraft and weapons systems test and evaluation services. This is a request for information being issued to the private sector community. This is NOT a solicitation. There is no guarantee that a solicitation will be issued as a result of this preliminary planning effort. If the Department of the Navy determines to move forward with a solicitation, a separate document will be published. Response to this inquiry announcement is voluntary. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information. The information collected through this process is considered to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii). 

Background.  The Naval Air Warfare Center operates and maintains sea, air, land, and electronic combat ranges to support aircraft and weapons systems T&E.  Range personnel provide engineering and technical services required to collect and analyze a broad spectrum of quality data ultimately to be used by the Navy acquisition community decision makers.  Land, air and sea space communications and control, time and space position measurement, and test vehicle instrumentation and prototyping are high level products.  Additionally, weapons energetic material testing and quality assurance are products of the functions under survey.  The work environment is one of externally driven, rapidly changing priorities, conflicting schedules and evolving requirements requiring a flexible, experienced workforce to accomplish the mission.  The service provider will be required to reapportion the workforce on a permanent or temporary basis and on short notice in response to these changes.  Mission failure is not an option due to the time critical nature of products and ramifications on interrelated Navy programs.

It is seeking a comprehensive facility maintenance system to keep track of routine as well as ad-hoc maintenance issues.  The USSS would prefer to use a Consumer Off the Shelf (COTS) system with minimal customization rather than develop a custom, proprietary system for this purpose.  Such a system should include, but not be limited to, the following functionality:     

Track routine / scheduled facility maintenance for multiple buildings

Tickle  (send automatic reminders) about routine / scheduled maintenance

User interface should be web-based (Microsoft IIS)
Backend database must be Oracle 10g or MS SQL (Oracle preferred)

The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to determine the availability of COTS software that would meet the needs of the JJRTC Facility Maintenance staff ; 2) to improve the overall understanding of what COTS options are available for facility maintenance tracking; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow USSS to assess the partnering opportunities that exist within industry.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or  (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA ? Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority.

TSA envisions a single award as the end result of this screening process to a company whose proposed technical solution and price (inclusive of the base and all option years) represents the best value to the agency.  However, TSA makes no guarantee of award of contract as a result of this or any future SIR.        

Background

Director Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/1, Section 5.1, establishes the requirement for a Special Security Office to serve as the focal point(s) for the receipt, control and accountability of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and other SCI security functions for one or more SCIFs.

DCID 6/1, Section 5.2, establishes Special Security Officer (SSO)/Control Officers that are appropriately SCI-indoctrinated officers, designated to perform day-to-day SCI security cognizance over offices and subordinate SCIFs, that SCI is authorized to be handled by organizations served by them.  Officers must be appropriately trained in SCI security policy and procedures and provide security advice and assistance on SCI matters to their organization and other activities being supported.  DCID 6/1, Section 5.2.4, the SSO is responsible for conducting or managing required SCI personnel and physical security actions and procedures.  DCID 6/1, Section 5.2.6, the SSO is responsible for continued interface with SCI Telecommunications centers, AIS facilities and similar offices to ensure SCI security.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for Commercial Service/Items prepared in accordance with the Format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Reference  Number N4561007RC00015 is issued as a request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 97-19. This solicitation is Unrestricted. NAICS 541990. This requirement is for the Navy Consolidated Brig, Charleston, SC.This position is for a Metal Shop Supervisor First Shift. The Brig is an adult correctional facility in which personnel of both sexes (primarily male), up to a maximum of 400 persons, may be confined to serve sentences imposed by appropriate military authority.  Though the brig is a naval facility, members of other services are incarcerated therein in accordance with established inter-service agreements.
Confinees at a consolidated brig may include murderers, rapists, drug dealers, long-term absentees, child molesters, and other such offenders.  Staff consists of professional-level employees such as administrators, doctors, and program specialists as well as corrections officers, counselors and other line staff.

Fire emergency vehicle marking standards have been approved for the Pacific Northwest Region.  The standards provide for safety, consistent appearance and application, as well as adherence to agency policy and direction for fleet vehicle marking.

Implementation of the Fire Emergency Vehicle Marking Standards is to begin immediately.

Fire emergency vehicle marking standards include:

?	An approved Forest Fire Emergency Vehicle Operating Plan and Job Hazard Analysis must be in place.
?	Each fleet vehicle designated as a fire emergency vehicle shall be approved by the Forest Supervisor and identified in the operating plan.
?	Approved fire emergency vehicles shall have the standard marking and emergency lighting package.  Striping or lights only are not acceptable.
?	The fire emergency vehicle marking package shall follow the standards for design, labeling and color as identified in the enclosed document.
?	All vehicles which are not approved as fire emergency vehicles shall have non-standard markings or equipment removed no later than next annual maintenance/safety inspection for the vehicle (within one year).
?	Approved fire emergency vehicles which currently have non-standard markings will, at a minimum, immediately correct the organization, unit and position identifiers.  Striping will be brought to standard as unit budgets allow or when the vehicle is replaced.

The Fire Emergency Vehicle Standards will provide an added measure of visibility to enhance safety in incident management, represent the Forest Service as a cohesive professional fire organization, and enhance daily operations and incident response through standard nomenclature and design.

Questions on implementation of the standards may be directed to Jeff Pendleton, Chair, Regional Fire Emergency Marking Committee, at (541) 575-3103, Carl Gossard, Assistant Director of Fire Operations at (503) 808-6461, Becky Hutchins, Regional Equipment Manager at (503) 808-2393, or Shonni Hanks, R6 Fleet and Equipment Specialist at (503) 808-2892.

Rationale for Recommendations:

The recommendation provides:

??	A consistent implementation of marking for safety which is compliant with NFPA 1906 standard, as applied by other fire service organizations.

??	Consistent recognized color scheme and organization identification for FS/BLM fire resources.  The white vehicle package meets the shift of both agencies to the procurement of white vehicles from the manufacturer.  The green vehicle package meets the needs for older FS ?green fleet? and BLM ?green? engine color. 

??	Allows for Agency affiliation through use of agency emblems, and meets agency marking requirements for all fleet.

??	Unit identification utilizing nationally recognized mnemonics documented in Regional Mob Guide.  Provides for development of mnemonics for interagency fire units and combined forest units.

??	Display of Unit position, which defines the level of the individual in the organization, when matched with IFPM standards relates to minimum ICS qualifications for incident operations.

??	Specific identification numbering system that is standard through out the region and is designed to reflect local geographic home unit/sub-unit.  Allows flexibility to exclude position identifier for units with shared fleet.

??	Uniform and consistent presentation and identification of FS/BLM vehicles, positions and call signs, reducing confusion of cooperators and local fire service agencies, when resources are mobilized to other units, areas, or incidents.

??	Procedures to incorporate fire emergency vehicle standards in agency directives.

The sampling of identification/numbering systems currently in use in the Pacific Northwest were designed to provide Agency/Unit identification, sub-unit identification, position or level within the unit, and a resource specific number identifier.  The recommended emergency fire vehicle marking standards provides the same levels of identification in a consistent format throughout the PNW.
