<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Three (3) Each, Fiber Optic Vertical Gyroscope Sensors. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from CROSSBOW TECHNOLOGY INC., who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NASA/LaRC requirements include a state of the art "instrumentation grade" smart sensor with a very small size requirement.=20 Crossbow Technology, Inc. is the only company that can provide this "instrumentation grade" fiber optic sensing technology in a very small package and include eight different measurements (roll angle, pitch angle, roll rate, pitch rate, yaw rate, x acceleration, y acceleration and z acceleration) in one unit.  It would take substantial time and money for another company to duplicate these components to meet the power (Input Voltage of 10-30 VDC) , size and weight ( a weight &lt;3.5lbs and a size of 5" by 6" by 4"),  and accuracy requirements (Pitch angle static &lt;+/-0.5 degrees,  Pitch angle dynamic 2.0 degrees RMS  , Roll angle static &lt;+/-0.5 degrees, Roll angle dynamic 2.0 degrees RMS).  Those costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (Phone Calls are NOT accepted) to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681; fax number 757-864-6966, not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on September 30, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California  for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation to provide construction management services to oversee the design and construction of general and special purpose facilities.. By issuing this RFI, we are soliciting sources, information and suggestions for the solicitation, including: appropriate type of contract (firm, fixed-price versus time-and-materials, etc.); feasibility of the requirement (including performance requirements and data requirements); statement of work; proposal instructions, and evaluation criteria (including the approach for assessing past performance information); the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions.

We currently anticipate a one-phase solicitation. We would issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to interested qualified sources and, using published evaluation criteria, rank responding offerors, select the source offering the best value to the government, and negotiate a contract with that top-ranked source. We anticipate that this non requirements contract would be on a time-and-materials basis with up to four option years at about $500,000/year.   Furthermore, the foregoing is simply our current thinking and our approach may change, based on various factors, including programmatic, schedule, or budget needs, as well as responses to this RFI.

The selected firm would need to provide the following personnel.  The type and approximate number of staff, with the anticipated work duration, are as follows.  Some categories are not full time positions.   The manpower durations are estimates only and the University makes no guarantees of funding for any of these categories.

Project Controls Engineer: He shall review the project master schedule so that duration of activities are logical and realistic, specifications are considered, and the critical path is feasible.  He shall provide stringent cost control methods in coordination with the University Project Controls personnel for complete integration of cost methods.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to place an award to continue the rural area law enforcement research study initiative and to conduct Small Town and Rural (STAR) related training with Minot State University, 500 University Avenue West, Minot, North Dakota 58707.  The FLETC Procurement Division proposes to procure this requirement on a sole source basis with Minot State University in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  In Fiscal Year 2001, the FELTC awarded contract Tftc 01-31 to Minot state University to conduct research regarding rural law enforcement training needs in the Northern Plains states - North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.  As a result of this reseach, additional research is required and training must be conducted and evaluated to substantiate Minot's initial research.  Minot has performed the precursory reseach and maintains the research data.  Therefore, to compete this project and award to another contractor would cause an undue expense to the Government, the loss of valuable research already conducted, and the resk of not completing the project requirements.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to issue a solicitation entitled "Long Term Effects Of Potent Antiretroviral Therapy On HIV-Induced Nervous System Disease", as a 100% full and open competitive acquisition under NAICS Code 541710.  The purpose of this initiative is to assess the long-term effects of potent ART on HIV-induced disease of the nervous system, focusing on the complete range of neurological, neuropsychological and neurobehavioral outcomes of therapy. The NIMH plans to award one (1), five-year, cost-reimbursement contract to an organization that will function as a coordinating center to conduct and manage this study. The Government estimates that 4-6 sites will be utilized in this study, to assess a total of 400-500 subjects per year, and that 10-20% of these subjects will be followed for a longer period of time (the majority of the patients in this study will be evaluated once).  Sites shall be selected through a competition process, after award, with the concurrence of the NIMH. The Contractor/sites shall gather current and on-going data on HIV positive individuals who 1) are currently undergoing antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection; 2) about to start antiretroviral treatment; 3) have undergone ART treatment and stopped; and/or 4) are taking psychotropic or other medications in combination with ART.

The Contractor will be responsible for central coordination including recruiting study sites, protocol development and finalizing the study design, preparing informed consent documents, providing data forms, training, centralized communication, data entry and management, quality control procedures, site monitoring, statistical analysis, report writing and other related activities. Procedures shall be developed for the collection, storage, retrieval and final disposition of patient samples. For subjects that are going to be followed, the Contractor will need to retain and store blood and plasma samples.  The Contractor shall propose a centralized laboratory site to receive, process, and store study samples.
The study shall address the following broad objectives 1) Assessment of the incidence and prevalence of HIV associated dementia, minor/cognitive motor disorder and neuropsychological impairments including depression and anxiety in HIV infected individuals in all stages of treatment history; 2) Evaluation of viral genotypes in CSF and other body compartments following potent ART; 3) Neuroimaging assessments after potent ART; 4) Assessment of CNS- and peripheral nervous system- related side effects resulting from potent ART such as abnormal lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy; 5) Assessment of drug interactions between ART and psychotropic or other medications.
Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIMH-01-AI-0005 will be available on or about December 6, 2000, and the receipt date for proposals will be on or about April 4, 2001.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This RFQ (RFQ2-38162) adds specifications to the statement of work previously advertised as RFQ2-38155.  RFQ2-38155 was cancelled on 9/18/02.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA-Ames Research Center plans to purchase a Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS). Statement of Work  NASA Ames is engaged in a long-term research program related to the operation of intelligent robots on other planets.  As part of this research program, Ames developed the K9 rover, a prototype planetary surface robot with a chassis developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and electronics developed at Ames Research Center.  The K9 group is currently adding capabilities and instrumentation to the rover which are important to researchers who wish to test their technology using the rover.	 An important part of the research performed on the rover is navigation to science targets, avoiding obstacles.  In order to test these abilities and demonstrate the robustness required for actual flight to Mars, the rover team must make many repeated test runs in an outdoor simulated Mars environment, and accurately measure the rover's path.  The rover team must also compare the rover's model of where science targets and obstacles are in the environment to their actual location. Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) appear to be the most reasonable way to locate the rover accurately over a large area and without a line-of-sight requirement between the rover and a base station.  DGPS requires a base station of known location and a mobile station.  If more than one simultaneous measurement is required, multiple mobile stations can make use of the information from the single base station. Power requirements and size are important for the mobile rover system. The DGPS has the following requirements: - Simultaneous measurements: Location measurements must be simultaneously available on both the rover and also a hand held unit. - Accuracy:  Accuracy is particularly important when moving the rover arm to measure a sample from a rock.  Location measurements must be accurate to within 1.5 centimeters for both horizontal and vertical directions.   - Update rate: The rover and hand held units must provide at least 20 updates per second (10 Hz); faster is better. - Measurement range: This system will be used during extended field tests outside Ames.  The maximum distance between the base station and the rover or mobile station is 2 kilometers.= =20 Line of sight cannot be required between base station and rover.  - Communications link: If a communications link is required by the DGPS between base and mobile stations, it must be standard RS-232, 38400 baud or less, and function with up to 1 second of latency.  (The RS-232 information will be routed over an existing radio newtwork). The vendor is not required to provide a wireless link.  - Power (rover):  Power draw is of critical importance on the rover, since the rover is powered by solar cells.  The rover mobile unit must use no more than  4 watts of power, and must be compatible with a 12 volt DC supply. - Size (rover):  Space is of critical importance inside the chassis of the rover.  The rover mobile unit must be no larger than 4" x 7" x 1" - Size (hand held): The hand held mobile unit must be enclosed and should be reasonably small (10" x 5" x 3" or smaller is desired). The Specifications for the DGPS are as follows: 1. Quantity 1 of DGPS receiver board with Novatel part number OEM4-RT2 or equivalent.=20 This unit will be used on the K9 rover. 2. Quantity 2 of an enclosed DGPS receiver unit with Novatel part number PwrPak-4-RT2 or equivalent.  One unit will be used as a base station and the other unit will be a handheld unit. 3. Quantity 3 of an antenna with Novatel part number GPS 600 or equivalent.  These are antennas for the above DGPS units. 4. Quantity 2 of a 2.2 meter antenna cable with Novatel part number 01016644 or equivalent. 5. Quantity 2 of a 5 meter antenna cable with Novatel part number GPS-C006 or equivalent. 6. Quantity 1 of an interface antenna hook up (Novatel part number 01016772 or equivalent)	for the OEM40RT2 or equivalent unit. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-08. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.	The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 421490 and 100, respectively. The quoter shall state in their quotation their size status for this procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with the University of Texas at Austin, construction Industry Institute (CII) to provide services to collect information on 9/11 driven security initiatives from industry leaders in the areas of chemical manufacturing, oil production and refining, natural gas processing and distribution, power generation and distribution, and water treatment, and possibly other critical industries needed to support the Nation's infrastructure.  It is believed that this sole source is justified based on the fact that CII is a unique consortium of the nation's leading facility owners, designers, builders, and universities that are addressing the increasing need for capital project effectiveness.  CII maintains a benchmarking and metrics database that permits the measurement of:  performance norms and trends within the capital projects industry, the degree to which innovative practices are used, and the economic value associated with the use of innovative practices.

This project has five (5) tasks as follows: 
1)  A statistical analysis of selected cross-sections of projects from the CII Benchmarking and Metrics database-one cross section for each of the above-referenced critical industries; 
2)  Based on the results of Task 1 and other industry information, identify a candidate set of projects/organizations with exemplary project execution processes and use the candidate set to create a representative team focused on identifying best practices for 9/11 driven special security requirements in industrial facilities; 
3)  Convene a series of regional workshops to solicit input from stakeholders in each of the above-referenced critical industries on recommended practices for 9/11 driven special security requirements in industrial facilities; 
4)  Conduct field site visits to selected industrial facilities in each of the above-referenced critical industries; and 
5)  Prepare and deliver a presentation summarizing the key findings from the regional workshops and the field site visits.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about September 27, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  FAR Part 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items" will apply to this requirement.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>NOTE: This procurement is open ONLY to LAW FIRMS or SOLO practitioners of LAW licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  As a result of P.L. 104-134, which amended the Federal Debt Recovery Act, the Department of Justice intends to award contracts to private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the following federal judicial district:  Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  The contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); to input relevant case data in a computer base maintained by the government.  Payment will be made by a combination of contingency fees and firm, fixed prices.  Law firms or solo practitioners who respond to this solicitation MUST be regularly engaged in the private practice of LAW within the Eastern Federal Judicial District of Michigan.

NOTE: The Act provides that the Department may contract ONLY with law firms or solo practitioners of law since contractors must represent the United States in court.  The government anticipates awarding up to four contracts (or more or less at the discretion of the government).  The period of performance for each contract will be one base year plus up to six optional years.  
The solicitation will be available about September 25, 2002 and will be distributed solely through the General Service Administration's Electronic Posting System - FedBizOpps.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Julie Silva, 928-328-6259
<DESC>NA This is Amendment 0002 to previous combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that posted in Federal Business Opportunities on 28 August 2002. Amendment 0001 to this solicitation posted in Federal Business Opportunities on 13 Sep 2002.  The closin g date and time for this solicitation HAS NOT BEEN EXTENDED and remains at 9:00 AM MST, 23 September 2002.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions/comments submitted in response to the Amendment 0001 revisions:  Q1:  The specifi cations in question request a DTMF code at the remote station and a FSK code at the central station. This is inconsistent and represents a system security risk.  Most systems designed for military SCADA applications are digital FSK systems that have the ab ility to increase the level of security if needed.  DTMF is not secure and can easily be recorded and played back creating potential security risks. We advise against using this old format. The central station should send out a consistent and secure FSK pr otocol and the remote stations should receive this same format.  A1:  DTMF code format has been changed to FSK format for the Remote Stations.  (See revised Specification).  Q2:  With regard to-The controller shall be equipped with CTCS...- CTCS is a funct ion of a radio, not a siren controller. If you use a radio control system CTCS would enhance the RF security.  A siren controller does not have this capability.  A1: The specification is revised to delete the statement-The controller shall be equipped with  Continuous Tone Coded Squelch (CTCS) to harden the system against falsing by spurious signals.  The statement is replaced with the following sentence-Contractors proposing a radio control system, shall ensure it is equipped with Continuous Tone Coded Sque lch (CTCS) to enhance RF security. (See revised Specification)  Q3:  If the proposed system is radio controlled will YPG provide the frequency to operate the sirens?  A3:  Yes.  Q4:  Obtaining a license for a new Radio Frequency generally takes several mon ths or more to receive. If not, is YPG willing to accept this delay?  A4:  No, YPG is not willing to accept the delay.  If a contractor is proposing equipment with a radio controller, it shall be within one of the two bands specified in the solicitation. In addition, all offerors must provide evidence, with their proposal, that the manufacturer of the equipment they are proposing has a JF-12 document showing the equipment has been registered for use in the band specified in the solicitation.  Then YPG will  obtain the frequency assignment.  Change Specification paragraph 10 under-Central Control Station-from-Use a 32-bit operating system designed for Windows 95/98, 2000, NT or Millennium versions and meet standard operating criteria of new computer systems-T o-Use a 32-bit operating system designed for Windows NT or 2000 versions and meet standard operating criteria of new computer systems.  NOTIFICATION IS HEREBY PROVIDED THAT NO FURTHER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS SOLICITATION.  Offerors sh all acknowledge receipt and compliance with all Amendments with submission of their proposal.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

This procurement will be solicited on a full and open competitive basis, using FAR Subpart 13.5 test program procedures.   This announcement constitutes the solicitation for the required supplies/services.  Quotes are hereby requested under N00140-02-Q-G718.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through FAC 01-09.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  QUESTION:  Is there a possibility for the contractor to obtain office and/or 
warehouse/storage space on the military installation?  If yes, what would the cost be to the Contractor, if any?  If no, do you have an estimate of sq feet needed for storage?  ANSWER:  No, the contractor can not obtain office and/ or space warehouse /storage space on the military installation.  If the government can provide additional storage space, it would be made available to store materials and at no cost to the contractor.  Presently, the government has storage space (approximately 320 sq ft) to store material from previous events.  There are several odd sized items.  For example there is one box that is 8'x8' X 3' (Christmas Tree).  Most items are stored on pallets.  It is estimated that an additional 200 square feet of storage space will be required.  QUESTION:  Is there Event related material in storage at the present time?  If yes, what is the estimated sq ft.  ANSWER:  Yes, there is event related material in storage.  Present Storage is estimated to be 320 square feet . However, there is an estimate for an additional 200 square feet of storage space.  QUESTION:  I just wanted to clarify that the pricing for this bid will be based solely on the labor rates times the labor hours specified in the RFQ.  Once this contract is awarded ? pricing on specific events will be done under this contract on a case by case basis.  In other words, do we or do we not have to include a total cost for materials, equipment rental, etc. in the bid on this contract.  If so, how would we have any idea on how to cost such expenses?  Are we required to cost out any travel, local or otherwise in our bid?  ANSWER:  Amendment 2 responses verified that the ceiling for CLIN 0007 is $100,000 for the base and each subsequent option year.  This amount will be used for comparison of all proposals.  In the proposal please identify whether travel is anticipated and include locations.  QUESTION:  Reference to the contract line number CLIN 0007 Other Direct Costs (ODC) (travel, material, subcontracts, equipment rental), please identify which of the special event(s) should be used for the computation of the ODC?  Or, should the ODC be a cumulative total of the sample projected events listed in the solicitation?  ANSWER:  See previous response.  QUESTION:  What are the size and extent of participation, specific site or multiple sites, etc. for each of the events?  ANSWER:  This will be specified on the individual orders placed against the contract.  QUESTION:  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday, is this event going to be a display type of celebration?  Conference type?  Or Display and conference?  Is this going to be located at DLA Hqs, Fort Belvoir?  Pentagon?  Ft. Myer? Or multiple locations?  ANSWER:  This will be decided on each delivery order.  QUESTION:  What is the size of conference participants?  ANSWER:  This will be decided on each delivery order.  QUESTION:  What is the size of site(s) visitors?  ANSWER:  This will be decided on each delivery order.  QUESTION:  The solicitation is also suggesting that ODC should not be provided because each individual delivery/service order will be calculated based on its unique requirements to be worked out with the KO or COR.  If so, how should CLIN 0007 be answered?  ANSWER:  See previous response.  NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED ON THIS SOLICITATION.  Please contact Ms. Brenda Geist (brenda_geist@hq.dla.mil) for further assistance at (703) 767-1172.

<CONTACT>Penny S. Kennedy (301) 744-6626
<DESC>DESC: PILOT-SCALE SYNTHESIS OF SPECIALITY CHEMICALS.  GOVERNMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Indian Head Division is seeking sources that can provide 1 kg to 100 kg quantities of specialty chemicals to be used in Navy pilot-scale synthesis programs.  All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the sp ecification can be met.   The published chemical synthesis pathways and purity specifications for these needed materials are known.  The recommended synthesis pathways for two immediate candidates are given below: 3,6-Bis(3,5-Dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-Tetrazine (DMPT) Guanidine hydrochloride is refluxed with hydrazine monohydrate in 1,4-dioxane for two hours.  After the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, the resulting triaminoguanidine hydrochloride (TAG-HCl) product is filtered, washed with 1,4-dioxane, and dried.  The TAG-HCl is reacted with two equivalents of 2,4-pentanedione at 70oC.  The product of this reaction, 3,6-Bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (BDDT), is isolated by filtration after cooling to room temperature.  The filter cake is washed with water and then dried.  BDDT is then reacted with gaseous nitrogen dioxide (NO2)  in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) at room temperature to form 3,6-Bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DMPT).  The reaction mixture is drowned with ice water and filtered.  The filter cake is washed with water, and then dried.    Sodium Azotetrazolate Pentahydrate (NaZT) Sodium azotetrazolate pentahydrate (NaZT) is prepared by dissolving 5-amino-1H-tetrazole monohydrate in sodium hydroxide solution.  The solution is heated to 65-70oC, followed by the addition of potassium permanganate.  The excess potassium permanganate is destroyed by slow addition of sodium sulfite, and the product is recovered by filtration.  The filtrate is saved and cooled and additional product is collected in a second filtration.  The resulting bright yellow crystals are stored water-wet. Any technical questions can be directed to Dr. Randall J. Cramer, (301) 744-2578,  cramerrj@ih.navy.mil  or Mr. Jerry Salan, (301) 744-6123,  salanjs@ih.navy.mil All other questions should be directed to Ms. Penny Kennedy, Contracting Officer at kennedyps@ih.navy.mil.  Any capability statements, company literature, brochures or any other information should be sent to NAVSEA Indian Head, 101 Strauss Avenue, Building 1558, Attn: Penny Kennedy, Contracting Officer, Indian Head, Maryland 20640-5035. Deadline for submission of information is within 30 days of this announcement.

The US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Silver Spring, Maryland is seeking sources for a planned acquisition of real-time lightning strike information and detection system status information (collectively called "data" or "lightning data").  At a minimum any vendor responding to this Sources Sought must have an established CONUS lightning data network capable of meeting the stated detection and location accuracy requirements by the date of contract issuance.  NOAA/NWS will be the lead agency for this acquisition.  Other agencies receiving data under this acquisition include, but are not limited to the; Department of Transportation, Department of Interior, Department of Defense, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Users of the data include agency field sites, research organizations, and administration offices.  Some of the agencies will disseminate data to other government agencies (federal, state and local). The Government needs cloud-to-ground lightning data and total lightning data (total lightning includes cloud-to-ground, cloud-to-cloud, and in-cloud data).  Vendors responding to this sources sought need to state their network's capabilities.  The government requires that the vendor's network be capable of detecting 99% of all lightning strikes over the CONUS and up to 80% of all strikes over other areas.

The time of the occurrence must be reported to the nearest 0.001 second. Government agencies will have the option to receive data directly from the vendor, through the NWS' Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG), through NOAAPORT, through the Internet or through an intermediate contractor.  The agencies will also have the option to obtain vendor-produced display hardware and software, the vendor's archived data and any available vendor generated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products.  The Government reserves the right to archive lightning data issued via NOAAPORT or the NWSTG. Lightning data is needed from terrestrial and marine areas including: Terrestrial Areas; United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica, Marine Areas; Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Carribean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Southern Ocean.

<DESC>The Air Force intends to hold an Industry Day for preliminary market research and informational purposes for a Rapid Attack Identification, Detection, and Reporting System (RAIDRS). The goal of this session is to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in RAIDRS development. The importance of space systems to U.S. war fighting capability has been shown in Operations Desert Storm, Allied Force, and Enduring Freedom. Detecting attacks on U.S. satellites and military service providers will be an important factor in maintaining U.S. military superiority in future conflict. RAIDRS will consist of sensing elements and an information extraction element to provide decision makers and satellite operators with near real time awareness of the nature and source of an attack. To facilitate early FY04 acquisition activities, the RAIDRS Industry Day is planned for 9 October 2002 from 0830 to 1200 hours. It will be held at the SMC/AD Mission Area Prime Integration Contractor (MAPIC) facility: TRW Systems' Space Park campus, Building R-2, Redondo Beach, CA. The meeting will be conducted at the Secret level; therefore please fax clearances to TRW Security, Attn: Mark Mason at (310) 546-7833. Interested companies are limited to four (4) attendees total for all divisions and locations. Subsequent to Industry Day, the RAIDRS project team will request a Statement of Capabilities and facilitate discussions with interested companies. Please direct contractual questions to SMC/ADK, Capt Steven King by telephone at (310) 416-1569, or by email: steven.king@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center in partnership with the Defense Supply Center Richmond will host a Jet Engine Bearing Industry Day on Tuesday, October 22, 2002 at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, Tinker AFB, OK.  Sign in will begin at 12:30 p.m.  This is an advertisement for the Industry Day only and no solicitation is available at this time.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event.  The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.  

The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for the jet engine bearing industry.  The initial scope includes, but is not limited to the following jet engines:  F100, F101, F107, F112, TF33, F110, F108, F118, TF39, T56, J85, TF34.  Potential exists to establish several long-term business arrangements, which could result in contractual documents for new manufactured bearings for the engines identified above, with a long range strategy of expanding the scope to include all USAF and DoD bearing requirements.  The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve readiness and increase the responsiveness of the supply chain.  We desire to achieve reductions in the overall volume of contracts for this commodity, administrative lead-times, and production lead-times to enhance asset availability/visibility and lower costs to better support the warfighters.   PSCM incorporates many initiatives and concepts to enhance material support by integrating and streamlining supply chain functions.  Specific topics of discussion will be linking demand planning with replenishment planning, automating routine activities, e-business, direct vendor delivery (DVD), and other innovative purchasing and supply chain management techniques.  

In order to discuss issues pertaining to the Jet Engine Bearing Industry, OC-ALC and DSCR requests your participation in this Industry Day.  Please e-mail the following to Edward Adams no later than October 16, 2002, 4:30 p.m. (Central Standard Time):  the name of your company, the number and names of all potential attendees, point of contact, e-mail address, and phone number.  All visitors should be prepared to show a valid picture identification card to proceed on Tinker AFB.  A map with directions and location of conference will be provided by e-mail at a later date.  For additional information contact Dewayne Jones at 405-739-5490, e-mail: dewayne.jones@tinker.af.mil or Edward Adams at 405-739-4400, e-mail: edward.adams@tinker.af.mil

<SUBJECT>--New Generation Army Target Sytem (NGATS) Industry Day III Forum
<DESC>NA GENERAL:  The Army Targets Management Office, will host a THIRD Industry Day Forum on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 8 and 9, 2002, at Huntsville, AL.  The purpose of the forum is to provide interested parties and potential offerors information and an opportunity to  provide feedback on the proposed NGATS performance requirements.  Specifically, this third forum will focus on round table discussions of the Army's Performance Requirements Guideline Document (PRGD), and an initial briefing on the draft NGATS design.  Al l firms who produce target hardware, battlefield effects simulator, target control systems, target scoring systems, live fire ranges, or have experience in integration test and installation of similar distributed component systems are encouraged to attend this forum.  The PRGD is available for review at http://ngats.redstone.army.mil. BACKGROUND:  The Army Targets Management Office intends to develop a New Generation Army Target System to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges.  This NGATS target system will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchangeable and prov ide the required performance at a low life cycle cost.  Compatible NGATS components will be deployed on Army training ranges in a sequential or blocked program where each block represents increases in performance, reductions in life cycle cost, or both. Th e NGATS program is scheduled to begin fielding ranges in late FY06 with a Block I NGATS system.  The schedule for fielding Block II and subsequent blocks will be set at a later date.  In order to implement Block I, the Government has begun requirement defi nition and system design activities with a design integration contractor, CSC Inc of Huntsville, AL.  As a part of this design activity, the Government, along with the design integration contractor, will develop and provide system requirements and interfac es that target system components must meet.  The PRGD is the compilation of performance requirements that will serve as the source of information for specification development.  The INITIAL RELEASE of the NGATS Interface Control Documents is currently plan ned for early in the second quarter of FY03.  During FY03, and FY04 the Government intends to sponsor a series of Industry Days including the design integration contractor and interested target industry companies to present the progress of the design and i nterface definitions.  Technical input from industry is strongly desired at these meetings.  Industry comment on the progress and direction of the Government's activities will impact the content of the interfaces that NGATS Block I targetry components must  meet.  The Government's intent is to have a family of each type of system component that will meet the interface requirements and provide a spectrum of price/performance to satisfy the large spectrum of Army range types and requirements.  Beginning in FY0 3 and continuing through FY04, the Government plans to operate a facility at the Redstone Arsenal where targetry component manufacturers can have their products tested for conformance to the requirements/interfaces. In late FY04, the Government will contra ct on a competitive basis, with a Production Integration Contractor to integrate and test a targetry system consisting of components that have been shown to meet the requirements/interfaces.  Following the successful tests/demonstrations of the prototype t argetry system, the Production Integration Contractor will install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges.  Options for post warranty support of the installed ranges will be included in this contract for the use of range operators.  Installation of NGAT S Block I ranges is expected to continue for several years.  NGATS Block II and any subsequent releases will be produced as a result of future procurement actions to introduce technology advancement and satisfy new training requirements.  Such releases wil l be integrated and tested by a competitively sele cted production integration contractor who upon successful test/demonstration will be directed to install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges.  The Production Integration contract will include a Hardware, Software and Services Exclusionary provision that will impose a restraint upon future business.  This is necessary to preclude potential conflicts of interest and prevent the existence of a conflicting interest that might bias the Production Integration Contractor's judgment.  Please see subpart 9.5,  Federal Acquisition Regulation, 'Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest'.

The Contractor shall provide Community Area Television (CATV) for the Appropriated (Official) Areas on Robins Air Force Base in accordance with AFI 64-101, Cable Television Systems on Air Force Installations, and AF133-117, Visual Information (VI) Management. The Contract shall include service as well as installations for approved appropriated areas.

1.1	Cable TV Service and Maintenance.

Service shall be provided in accordance with industry standards. The contractor shall respond to reports of trouble within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed twenty-four hours. Weekends and holidays will not be included in the twenty-four hours for the administrative areas. The clock time shall include the weekend if the outage is determined to be in a public area such as the VOQ or TLF.  If the trouble is determined to be caused by factors not contributed to the contractor?s equipment or service and the contractor notifies the government they cannot meet the return to service period, the Contractor shall notify the Government of the nature of the outage and provide an estimate for the restoration of service.  
1.2	Cable TV Installation.  The Contractor shall provide all parts, tools, materials, labor and transportation to install additional CATV service at Robins Air Force Base. The Contractor shall respond within 10 working days to the request for additional service.  The response shall include a detailed description of the installation with a drawing, a schedule for completion and a quotation if any costs are associated with the installation. The Government will review the response and may issue a contract modification to provide funding, if necessary to complete the installation. If the Government issues a contract modification to the installation, the contractor shall complete the installation request within 14 working days from the delivery of the contract modification, unless an extension is presented in the installation schedule.  Reasons for an extension beyond the 14 days include installation of service requiring underground cable runs, trenching or extensive aerial runs. These shall be performed in a timely manner as shown in the schedule and agreed upon by the Contractor and Contracting Officer.
1.3	Cable Drawings.  The Contractor shall provide the Cable Television Contracting Officer with a red line drawing of any new installations within 15 working days of the completion of the installation.

The Government prefers the revisions in an electronic Microstation format, but will accept paper copies of the redline drawings. 

2.0 Channel Capacity.  There are two different coverage areas on Robins Air Force Base. The first area is the administrative office area with a requirement for ?official use CATV?.  The second area is the public section falling within the ?official use CATV? coverage. These include areas like the VOQ, the TLF, the Gym and the base school. The Contractor shall provide ?basic service? levels for ?official use CATV?. The ?basic service? for the Robins Air Force Base shall consist of a minimum of 30 channels and shall include CNN, Headline News, the weather channel and the six local TV stations (WGXA, WMAZ, WMGT, WPGA, WGNM and WDCO). ?Basic Service? does not cover Premium channels such as HBO, Pay for View or data services such as cable modems.

3.0 Transition Period.  In the event that the contract is awarded to another Contractor other than the incumbent, the Government will provide for a transition period to prevent the disruption of service to any facilities with existing service.  
3.1 Length of Transition Period.  The maximum length of the transition period will be 30 days, but may be shorter depending in the length of time requested in the bid package.

Administrative areas are normally the offices and work areas as shown in the table.  The public areas will have the higher priority during the transition.  The new Contractor shall insure there are no outages in the public areas during the transition.  The administrative areas will have lower priorities for service transfer during the transition.  The Contractor shall provide the government a list of buildings without service, a timetable to provide service and a cost to provide service to each of the buildings within the transition period.   
            
4.0 Safety and Security.  The contractor shall conform to all safety and security requirements and regulations applicable to contractor activity at Robins Air Force Base.

1. INTRODUCTION            
             The 354th MXS/LGMCF currently operates and maintains the EAFTSS system located on Eielson AFB, AK. The system consists of 3 storage lines with storage space for 36 tanks each (108 tanks total). The system must be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round. To render the system fully operational in a reliable and safe working condition at all times, a comprehensive maintenance plan must be designed and followed, especially considering the severe climatic conditions in which the system is located.  The contractor shall perform the following functions: 
2. SCOPE OF WORK
2.1 Preventive Maintenance
Preventive maintenance shall consist of equipment inspection, cleaning, lubricating, and performance of all other scheduled adjustments and repairs to the EAFTSS. Scheduled adjustments will include a detailed inspection of:
a. Trolleys
b. Chains
c. Bearings
d. Fasteners
e. Welds
f. Drive mechanism
g. Take-up mechanism
Scheduled repairs will include equipment overhaul of:
a. Fasteners
b. Paint
c. Replace worn trolley wheels
d. Worn trolley wheels
e. Chain/Sprocket
f. Gear box lubrication change
g. Take-up - chain tension

Preventive maintenance shall also include any repairs, adjustments, and replacement of components, which are necessary to keep all mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and electronic systems in operational condition. The objective of preventive maintenance is to protect the operational capability of the system by detecting and correcting minor malfunctions before they become major repair items, disrupt operation, or become a safety hazard. Two maintenance visits will be required each year.  One maintenance service visit should occur in early fall and the other should occur in early spring.
2.2 Emergency/Remedial Maintenance
Emergency maintenance is the service rendered for the purpose of removing the cause of system downtime due to component or equipment failure or damage. Emergency maintenance is accomplished during normal working hours and at any time necessary to make the system operational. Remedial maintenance is also the service rendered for the purpose of removing the cause of the system downtime due to component or equipment failure to damage, but service shall be performed during normal working hours. Remedial maintenance is equivalent to emergency maintenance with the exception of urgency of the repair to make the system operational.
2.3 Routine Inspection/Maintenance Procedure
 This activity is performed by the government and consists of a weekly schedule of inspections and minor preventive maintenance tasks as outlined in a maintenance manual for the system. The contractor will provide technical assistance, and assistance in obtaining spare parts as required by the government maintenance crew at all times, while the contract is in effect.
3. PAYMENT SCHEDULE
Invoicing for service performed shall consist of two categories based on type of services.
One invoice will be for scheduled services according to the Maintenance Contract (items 2.1 and 2.3). The other category of invoicing will cover services or items added due to unscheduled events and replacement parts (item 2.2).
