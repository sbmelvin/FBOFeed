<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>DOE Radioactive Low-Level and Mixed Waste Transportation, <br />Treatment, Final Packaging, and Disposal</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division whom operates the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), has a requirement for a Contractor(s) to provide radioactive low-level waste (LLW) and radioactive mixed waste (MW) transportation, treatment, final packaging, and disposal services. The commencement of these services shall take place within the continental United States from PNNL's Richland, Washington facility for PNNL Hanford generated waste, referred to as PNNL waste in this Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>PNNL's radioactive waste is defined for this contract into the following categories:</p>
<p>Low-Level Waste (LLW) - Radioactive waste that is not high-level waste, spent nuclear fuel, or <br />Transuranic waste.</p>
<p>Mixed Waste (MW) - Waste that is regulated as a LLW and is also designated as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Hazardous or Dangerous Waste (i.e., carries a Federal Hazardous or Washington State Dangerous waste code).</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the treatment, final packaging, and acceptance of the waste by the disposal facility and/or landfill disposal, in accordance with all applicable Federal and State regulations, for containers of LLW and MW generated by PNNL outlined in this SOW.</p>
<p>PNNL will utilize the Contractor to provide transportation and brokerage services.</p>
<p>Due to regulations established by the State of Washington and the Department of Energy (DOE), PNNL waste requiring disposal after treatment may only be sent to waste disposal sites as identified by PNNL. The use of alternate waste sites is not allowed without prior written approval. The below information describes the approved disposition pathways based on waste types. PNNL expects the Contractor's technical approach to align with the below disposal options.</p>
<p>Department of Energy (DOE) Low-Level Waste (LLW): The Contractor shall dispose of all DOE LLW at the Hanford Site. The Contractor must maintain approved waste profiles and the ability to ship LLW to the Hanford Site.</p>
<p>DOE Mixed Waste (MW): The Contractor shall dispose of all DOE MW at either Envirocare of Utah, LLC. or the Hanford Site. PNNL may dictate the disposal site of choice and will notify the Contractor in advance. The Contractor must maintain approved waste profiles and the ability to ship MW to either Envirocare or the Hanford Site.</p>
<p>The Contractor accepts title of the waste during transportation and maintains ownership until disposal at an approved facility. Upon acceptance of waste for transport, the contractor (or subcontractor) shall assume any financial liability for losses and damages associated with mismanagement (negligent or otherwise) of the waste.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall designate a primary receiving/treatment facility and shall obtain separate prior written approval from PNNL for each subcontract entered into for handling PNNL's waste. All facilities (other than the one designated receiving/treatment facility) used during the management of PNNL's waste will be considered a subcontractor to the Contractor (even if it is a subdivision of the primary contractor).</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that subcontractors meet all requirements of this Contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor may chose the treatment method based on the physical and chemical constituents of the waste, applied waste codes, and /or as specified in the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) notification. Primary treatment option for this contract consists of:</p>

<p>The work will be performed at the Contractor's specified treatment facility(ies).</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Pickup of the waste materials shall commence as specified by PNNL, Radioactive Waste Representatives.</p>

<DESC>SPACE AND NAVAL WARFARE SYSTEMS COMMAND (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office  Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO-C4I), Command and Control (C2) Program Office (PMW 150), intends to procure Common Data Link Management System (CDLMS) units to accomplish urgent fleet Technology Refresh (TR) upgrades, Ship New Construction (SCN) initial deliveries, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) commitments.  This procurement will be conducted under the Common Afloat Local Area Network Infrastructure (CALI) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) via fair opportunity competitions.  The purpose of this synopsis is to announce that components of the CDLMS units will be brand-name supplies, which will be justified through a Class J&A under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1) and FAR part 6.302-1(c).  The provided list of components identifies the brand-name components (including the manufacturer, model/part number, item description, and the unique qualification of each part) prescribed in the CDLMS Technical Data Package (TDP), which are essential for successful operation of the CDLMS units.  The Hardware System and software architecture constraints of the CDLMS units generate the need for the specified brand name components.  The Government has experienced unacceptable re-certification cost, schedule growth and increased technical risk due to substitution of the specified parts in the past.  The Government anticipates procuring approximately seventy (70) brand-name unique items for use in fifty-seven (57) CDLMS production units, which will be procured by the CALI MAC prime contract holders via Delivery Orders awarded under the CALI MAC through 31 May 2018.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement with the following information: a) Company name, company address, CAGE code, point of contact, e-mail address, and telephone number; b) The part number(s) from the Government provided list for which the interested party seeks to provide a substitute; and c) The part number(s) and detailed specifications of the part proposed by the interested party, to include specifics on how the part proposed by the interested party meets or exceeds the Unique Qualification specified for the part to be substituted.  Responses are required no later than 15 days after the issuance of this synopsis.  Reponses shall be submitted to: Chris Thompson at chris.thompson1@navy.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete the procurement of the specified brand-name parts based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government is not seeking marketing material and any information provided beyond what is specified above will not be considered by the Government.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
