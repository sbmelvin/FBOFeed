<p>16. Description: <br />This solicitation is for one self-sustaining, U.S. flagged vessel, capable of maintaining an average speed of sixteen (16) knots and minimum operating range of 13,000 nautical miles (nm). The vessel shall have a minimum capacity of 2,350 TEUs and provide climate control for a minimum of 1,350 TEU ammunition laden containers.</p>
<p>Attached is a Draft RFP Section C providing part of the main technical portion of the RFP that will be forthcoming. Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to review the Draft RFP Section C now since the RFP will only be open for thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>Duration of the contract period: One 5 month base period with four 1-year option periods and one 6-month option period.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>17. Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide</p>
<p>18. Set-aside Status: This procurement will be competed as a tiered small business set-aside. If the government receives offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery; no offers received from other than small business concerns will be considered for award. If the Government does not receive offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery; all offers, including offers from other than small business concerns, will be considered for award.</p>
<p>19. Rationale for Small Business Strategy (as required by ASN(RDA) Memorandum, Improving Communications During the Market Research Process, dated 2 June 2014): The Contracting Officer could not make a conclusive determination, in an effort to promote small business participation, whether at least two or more offers would be received from small business concerns meeting the solicitation requirements at fair market prices. She determined that the use of a tiered or cascading evaluation of offers would be appropriate in accordance with DFARS 215.203-70 based on results of competition under RFP N00033-14-R-3201. MSC's Small Business Associate Director concurs with the determination of a tiered small business set-aside.</p>

<DESC>Description of Requirement
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Office of the Directory (OD), <br />plans to procure on a sole source basis sixteen (16) Vario 1539 Temperature Controlled Liquid Nitrogen Freezers; and four hundred and sixteen (416) 13/2 Stainless Steel Vertical Freezer Rack with Locking Rod from Cryo, 7905-A Airpark Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20879, USA.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501. The North American Industry Classification System code is 424690 and the business size standard is 500 employees. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm-fixed-price type contract. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The Center for Cancer Research (CCR) is an intramural scientific Division of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The CCR continually performs scientific experiments that generate biological samples that contain cellular components, extracts, DNA/RNA, proteins, serum, and other biological components. These samples require a constant ultra-low temperature of -80 degrees Celsius to preserve their integrity. CCR has a bio-repository facility space available to house ultra-low cryogenic freezers. To keep sample integrity risk to a minimum, CCR must utilize cryogenic freezers that can maintain -80 degrees Celsius using liquid nitrogen as a cooling/fuel source rather than electricity.</p>
<p>Next, a sole source is intended for the purchase and installation of (16) ultra-low temperature cryogenic freezers into a biological repository space that has been prepared to receive the freezers. The project also includes the procurement and installation of (416) vertical freezer racks that will be placed inside the freezers to house the biological samples that need such storage. Cryo Express is the only known supplier for the MVE Vario 1539 liquid nitrogen fueled freezer that is required. The salient characteristic for this tank is the fact that it can maintain a constant temperature of -80 degrees Celsius as opposed to the other liquid nitrogen fueled cryogenic freezers that maintain a temperature in the -150 degree Celsius range. The ability to modulate the nitrogen feed to maintain a -80 degree environment is critical. Many companies offer liquid nitrogen fueled cryogenic freezers, but none offer the modulation capability to maintain a -80 temperature set point as the MVE Vario 1539. In addition, the MVE Vari&#333;<sup>TM</sup> Series is the new innovative and energy efficient alternative for ultra-low temperature to cryogenic storage. The completely dry sample storage area will maintain a user-defined temperature anywhere between -20&deg;C and -150&deg;C. The MVE Vari&#333; Series significantly reduces the possibility of sample contamination via contact with LN2 while providing the safety margin and consistent temperature profile, even with the lid open, that is associated with LN2 based cryogenic storage. The MVE Vari&#333; Series is able to provide all of this with less than 1% of the power consumption and approximately 70% overall operating cost savings when compared to the leading mechanical freezers. Thus based on the unique features and specifications of the Vario 1539, it is the only item that can satisfy the NIH/CCR need for liquid nitrogen fueled -80 degree Celsius freezers.</p>
<p>Specifications of Vario 1539 are as follows:</p>
<p>1. User defined temperature within -20 &deg;C to -150 &deg;C operating range<br />2. Completely dry storage area<br />3. Consistent temperature profile, unaffected by lid openings<br />4. Integral Turn Tray for Easy Rack Retrieval (design provides significant ergonomic&nbsp;advantage for removing heavy racks from freezer)<br />5. No recovery time needed<br />6. LN2 consumption: 9 L/day<br />7. Power consumption, 8 W<br />8. Improved sample processing time due to rapid temperature recovery upon introduction of warm racks or samples<br />9. Safety margin (LN2 supply removed until -60 &deg;C)<br />a. 4 days from -80 &deg;C<br />b. 9 days from -150 &deg;C<br />10. 72 hour rechargeable battery backup option<br />11. Significant ambient noise reduction<br />12. Password protected controller<br />13. Alarms and Monitoring<br />a. 4-20 mA temperature output<br />b. Dual chamber temperature sensors<br />c. Event Log contains up to 30,000 unalterable, time stamped events (approx. 10 years)<br />d. 15 user defined audio/visual alarms<br />e. High temperature, lid open, and stuck valve discrete alarms<br />f. RS-485 communication for remote monitoring or control<br />14. Affordable and simple preventative maintenance<br />a. No expensive compressors to replace<br />b. Approximately 70% operating cost savings compared to leading mechanical freezers (-80 &deg;C) Based on power consumption and LN2 costs<br />15. Convertible asset, Can be field retrofitted to be a traditional LN2 freezer<br />16. Green: Environmentally Friendly<br />a. Less than 1% of the electricity consumption compared to leading mechanical freezers (-80 &deg;C)<br />b. No additional HVAC required due to negligible to negative thermal load<br />c. No ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrofluoric carbon (HFC) refrigerants<br />d. Zero CO2 emissions<br />e. No disposal issues; over 90% recyclable</p>
<p>Critical Required Features - The following features are critical and must be provided:</p>
<p>1. Variable Operating Temperature of -20c to -150c throughout the storage space for long term stable storage.<br />2. Must operate with liquid nitrogen as its cooling method as the freezers are being connected to a liquid nitrogen source<br />3. The unit cannot utilize compressors for cooling.<br />4. Integral Turn Tray for Easy Rack Retrieval<br />5. UL Listed<br />6. 100% Anhydrous Vapor Phase Storage <br />7. Folding Stainless Steel Step<br />8. All Stainless Steel Construction for Maximum Equipment Life<br />9. Locking Lid Tab<br />10. Stand Alone Control Unit for Ease of Service</p>
<p>Delivery and Installation</p>
<p>The contractor shall deliver the item within 60 days after award to NIH/NCI Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The Contractor will be provided with the complete mailing address and point of contact. Upon delivery, contractor must notify the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to schedule the installation date and time. To be carried out by the manufacturer and shall occur within approximately one week of delivery.</p>
<p>Payment</p>
<p>Payment shall be made after delivery, installation, and successful operation of all sixteen (16) (model 1539) Temperature controlled Liquid Nitrogen freezers and four hundred and sixteen (416) stainless steel vertical freezer rack with locking rods. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of an invoice to the NCI COR and NIH Commercial Accounts.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party especially a small business, believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Resource Management (OARM), Emergency Response Service Center (ERSC), on behalf of EPAs? Office of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Lab in Athens, Georgia under the authority of FAR Part 13, intends to award a sole source procurement to the University of Idaho under the direction of Dr. Dennis Keiser for support of the Watershed-Water-Energy-Nexus study.  The objective of this study is to demonstrate the flexibility and transferability of an integrated, inter-disciplinary modeling framework to different regions and problem statement by developing a software-based platform, comprised of multiple models and databases, for conducting process- and watershed-based, source-to-receptor assessments for microbes, chemicals and nutrients. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort shall be 541380 ? Laboratory Testing Services. This effort requires intimate knowledge of dairy operations; dairy management; the chemistry, biology and distribution of manure as point and/or non-point sources of pollution at dairies; manure loadings for mapping of microbes and nutrients; and expertise in assessing biological aspects of fate and transport of microbes and nutrients from different manure types (e.g., poultry dry litter, solid cattle pats, swine slurry); manure in soils and water pathways, all which have been demonstrated by the University of Idaho staff.  This effort requires familiarity, applications and publications associated with Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessments (QMRAs) and Integrated Environmental Models (IEMs) in addition to mandatory experience in applications and publications associated with stand-alone and IEM systems using various watershed models and related software, including SDMProjectBuilder, HSPF, BASINS, FRAMES-2, PEST, KINEROS2, and STWIR software modeling tools and statistical appr oaches used to analyze model uncertainty (e.g., Monte Carlo, bootstrapping/jackknifing) and validation (e.g., Nash-Sutcliffe), all of which have been demonstrated by the University of Idaho staff.  Finally and most importantly, this effort requires that these myriad number of disparate skills and capabilities be combined and integrated to form a unique set of qualifications, which to EPAs knowledge, can only be met by The University of Idaho?s staff.  The Government is continually seeking qualified vendors in obtaining a combination of specialty qualifications such as those required by this effort.  If there are any other vendors capable of providing such services, please submit proof of such via email to: scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than November 14, 2014 ? 12Noon, EST.  Please also be reminded that in order to establish business with any Federal Agency, a vendor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM): www.sam.gov .  If you feel that your business is capable of providing such services and you are not already registered in SAM, you must be able to show proof of registration by an anticipated award date of November 18, 2014.  NO PHONE CALLS will be accepted for this requirement.  You may submit any questions or concerns via email to: scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than November 10, 2014 ? 12Noon, EST.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.106-1(iv)(b), gives the Contracting Officer of Record the  discretion not to compete this requirement.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Orlando, is issuing this Market Survey for determining what capabilities exist and for determining Small Business
capabilities and is soliciting information from potential sources (large and small) to
provide an approach to satisfy NMRS requirements.


The Government is seeking information to determine the appropriate approach and
contract type for NMRS.  It is anticipated that this effort may result in a COTS software
solution, configuration and integration, and may be placed as a Task Order under the
Rapid Product Development & Sustainment (RaPDS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite
Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).  However, it may be done as a separate
procurement depending on the information received from the RFI.


See attached NMRS RFI for further information.

Ewing Cole, as Designer of Record (DOR), is currently finalizing 35% design documents on a current contract for the Quantico Middle/High School project. <br>  <br> Through the issuance of W91236-13-C-0031, Ewing Cole, as Designer of Record (DOR), continues to complete the base contract tasks.  The follow-on contract is necessary for Ewing Cole to complete the design documents through 100% as well as to address evolving project requirements, as required.  Use of a different design firm would require reworking the entire 35% design effort, at a significant cost to the Government.   <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The work will consist of performing 100% of the Engineering, Design, and Support services necessary to development and approve the construction plans and specifications for the Quantico Middle / High School, Quantico, Virginia, in strict compliance with the requirements included in the approved DD Form 1391.  This shall be a sole source, firm fixed price, new stand-alone  quote mark C quote mark  Architect-Engineer (AE) Contract, estimated in the amount of $2,500,000.00 to complete the design through 100%.  The period of performance shall be approximately 240 days.  The plans and specifications shall be prepared in accordance with the Department of Defense Education Association (DoDEA) 21st Century Educational Concepts, the DoDEA Facility Education Specifications, local school district program requirements, the Quantico installation's design guide, USACE's design guide, and integration of the geographic conditions and site constraints.  The design shall also include a comprehensive interior design package.  Furthermore, the remaining effort will include design review conferences at 65%, final, and design complete stages, as well as, presentations to the DoDEA Design Center and the DoDEA Leadership at specified design intervals.  An option for construction phase services in support of the Quantico Middle / High School shall be included in the scope of work.  The construction phase services will enable the Designer of Record (DOR) to provide critical support throughout the construction process including, but not limited to, responding to requests for information/support by the Resident Office overseeing construction, reviewing shop drawings, and performing site visits.  Participation in the construction phase services will also enable the DOR to identify and capture lessons learned to be incorporated back into the programming and standard design specifications being developed by the DoDEA Design Center staff.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems. <br>  <br> The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP web site at: <br>  <br> www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions  <br>  <br> To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP web site no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 8, 2015. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.   <br>  <br> No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the submitted to make certain the proposal is properly received by SERDP.  Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <br>  <br> There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.   <br>  <br>  <br> Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the SERDP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above. <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office web site at http://www.usace.army.mil/ HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness  provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate. <br>  <br> Points of Contact: <br> Procedural Questions - SERDP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565. <br>  <br> Contract Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420.  <br>  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan - HECSA, Ms. <br> Antwinette L.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) support of the Web Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (Web CCaRTM) system for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (DD 1423), the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet and the Customer List where services will be performed.
<p>Attachments are included to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the AFLCMC and AFRL and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The requirements of this task are for the provision of Web CCaRTM application support for the unique funding, planning, reconciliation, execution and reporting requirements and interface capabilities with various Government systems and applications for activities associated with AFLCMC and AFRL organizations, as well as in-depth experience and expertise to quickly and accurately respond to the wide variety of financial tasks and unique formats required for detailed financial and program related reporting. Contractor personnel must have knowledge of Air Force financial, contracting, and program management procedures, understand the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process, and understand the Requirements &amp; Planning Council (R&amp;PC) process. Web CCaRTM SME must have the familiarity with operating web-based database programs, as well as be proficient in all Web CCaRTM applications.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide functional support of the Web CCaRTM application. Web CCaRTM SME provides assistance and support to Web CCaRTM Administrators, needed to carry out Web CCaRTM administrative functions and Web CCaRTM functional tasks which include, but are not limited to, the following: set-up, configuration, daily operation and training of the Web CCaRTM application in direct support to AFLCMC and AFRL organizations. Web CCaRTM SME must have extensive knowledge of the following systems and how they interface with Web CCaRTM: General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), Automated Business Services System (ABSS), Contract Writing Document Preparation (ConWrite), and System Metric and Requirements Tool (SMART); as well as other systems that do not directly interface with Web CCaRTM e.g., Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS) and Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS). Web CCaRTM SME shall ensure that the Web CCaRTM application is properly tailored and configured to meet the unique requirements of the organization to include reimbursable Government accounting and various Business Management Review (BMR) chart configurations.</p>
<p>This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates utilizing a hybrid contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Reimbursable CLINs. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and two (2) option years. A multi-year contract allows for reduced staff manpower to initiate and award. This also allows stability with the eventual winner, i.e. able to sign employees to longer term contracts thus generating further efficiencies and best ensuring continuity in the support provided to the Government. Upon award of the option years, the same contractor is ready and able to deliver required services on day one without the need for transition time, or downtime, which again, creates efficiencies for the Government.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements, including the requirement for personnel to plan and part-mark 15 - 45 locations worldwide simultaneously and how the contractor will finance these operations. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone number, E-Mail Address, CAGE Code, Web Page URL, and Small business size certification, if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to AFLCMC/PZIT . Statements should be submitted no later than 21 November 2014 at 5pm EST.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOps website.</p>

<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought, Request for Information</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />NOTE: All correspondence must be submitted to the Contracting POCs.</p>
<p>1. Part: U.S. Government Procurements</p>
<p>2. Subpart: Engineering Services</p>
<p>3. Product/Service Code: B541</p>
<p>4. Agency: Department of the Air Force</p>
<p>5. Responsible Office and Address: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Directorate, Installation Support Contracting Division, Specialized Branch (PZID), 8500 Gibson Blvd SE, Bldg 20202, Kirtland AFB NM 87117</p>
<p>6. Notice Type: Sources Sought - Statement of Capabilities (SOC)</p>
<p>7. Description of the efforts needed are included in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS): AFNWC/PZID is contracting for Engineering tasks required to support sustainment and development of the AFNWC's various models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines. This effort shall require engineering, configuration management, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, and maintaining various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tool's hardware and software baselines. This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, and fielding approved changes to the various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform or support studies and analyses with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) as defined in PWS Para 3.5.1-3.5.5. These studies will analyze the lifecycle of various weapons systems, the sustainment of the weapon stockpile, projected effectiveness of weapons, and the development and testing of weapon effects for chemical and biological threats in various environments. These studies will require designing, developing, and adapting mathematical, statistical, econometric, and other analytical methods and techniques for various weapon systems and technologies. The Contractor shall document findings and recommendations in briefings and/or final reports. The Contractor shall propose Modeling, Simulations and Analysis (MS&amp;A) techniques for each study and receive concurrence before techniques are employed.</p>
<p>8. Foreign-owned firms are advised they are precluded from submitting a SOC, and no prime contractor may have a subcontractor who is foreign-owned. These firms are advised to direct questions to the Contracting Points of Contact listed below. These positions require employees to be United States Citizens with the capability to obtain and maintain a minimum Top Secret clearance.</p>
<p>Foreign Citizen Performance Restrictions (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This requirement is "export-controlled." The information and materials provided pursuant to, or resulting from, this requirement are restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 - 774, which control the export of sensitive technical data. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a US Person, as defined by 22 C.F.R &sect; 120.15 or if offeror is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as US Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award, and no prime contractor may have a subcontractor who is a foreigner. Foreign Citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.</p>
<p>9. Technology developed under this requirement may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information, and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's PWS. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.</p>
<p>10. Request for Statement of Capability (SOC):</p>
<p>The SOC shall contain the following information: (1) Demonstrate ability to respond to all mission areas; (2) Include a notional plan to assure the availability of an adequate number of qualified and trained personnel to perform the continuous mission requirements; (3) Demonstrate how classified work at the Top Secret level would be accomplished to design, test, document, and field approved changes to the various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit, to the Contract Specialist listed below, an UNCLASSIFIED response that includes detailed information demonstrating their capabilities. SOCs may be emailed to the Contracting Points of Contact listed below by the response date identified in Paragraph 12. The SOC is limited to 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font. NOTE: If there is a resulting contract, it will be made only to offeror(s) who can perform the work within the AFNWC facility and have sufficient Top Secret cleared personnel with current qualifications available at the time of contract award. All contractor employees shall maintain, at a minimum, a Top Secret, level clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI), and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Also, access to classified Air Force and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) databases will be required at the Top Secret Level.</p>
<p>Firms responding should include their DUNS number and cage code. Firms should include if they are a GSA Schedule holder and under what Schedule and Special Item Number(s) (SINs) they would propose potential work. The government anticipates using NAICS Code 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services; Size Standard: $27.5M.</p>

<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Responses to this section do not have a page limit and should be separated from the SOCs. NOTE: Answers to the below will be used to develop the government's acquisition strategy and will not be shared with any outside sources.<br />1. Based on the DRAFT PWS, do you concur that NAICS Code 541511 is the most appropriate code for this requirement? If not, what is your recommendation? Please provide your rationale for the recommendation provided.<br />2. Based on the type of work identified in the PWS what type of contract do you believe best fits the work structure, for example: Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, etc.? Please provide your rationale for the recommendation provided. <br />3. Based on the type of work identified in the PWS, are you aware of existing contracts that may be able to support this requirement? If so, please identify the contract number, the agency under which the contract was awarded, and a government point of contract (preferably the contracting officer).<br />4. The government believes this requirement does not fit the definition of a commercial acquisition as defined in FAR 2.101, Commercial Item, and will therefore proceed with a non-commercial process. If you believe otherwise, please provide your rationale.</p>
<p>5. The government believes that a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract may be the best type of contract for this requirement, but has not made that final determination. If you have experience with a better type, please provide your recommendation and rationale.</p>

<DESC>1.0  Description  <br> The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Plans Programs & Resources) is  seeking capable and interested 8(a) small business sources  that could provide support to study, analyze, and provide recommendations for the size and competencies of the Army Acquisition Workforce.  Included in this effort are aspects of strategic planning coupled with analytic measures to create predictive resource staffing models, and competency management for human capital solutions.  <br> The duration of this effort is anticipated to be 5 years <br>  <br> 1.1  Request For Information (RFI) Only.  <br> This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The RFI respondees are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov and the GSA E-Commerce Central website: http://www.gsa.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> 2.0  Background  <br> The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology underwent a strategic review to determine how to best organize future manpower requirements. The review identified additional practices necessary to validate workload requirements that canbe adjusted quickly to meet changes in demand. A memorandum distributed by the Army Acquisition Executive directed the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Plans Programs & Resources (DASA PP&R) to lead three efforts: 1) Identify core capabilities, 2) Organize and determine staff for Life Cycle Management, and 3) Establish a flexible model to accommodate requirements and human resource issues. In so doing, DASA PP&R developed a Human Capital Strategic Plan that provides a consistent approach in identifying and validating detailed workloads and skill sets across the Acquisition workforce. <br>  <br> Currently, DASA PP&R has deployed PRSM for the Program Management (PM) function. The results and utility of the model prove to be a new paradigm on workload analysis. The PRSM methodology will continue to be used to build models for the Logistics, Contracting, Research & Development, Test, and Facilities Engineering functions. Ultimately, these functions will be integrated into a single tool used to predict workforce requirements across the Army acquisition workforce; ultimately gaining optimal staffing for future capabilities and skill sets. In order to provide recommendations, strategic planning and analytic measures will be used to develop optimal structures, tools (predictive resource staffing models), and human capital solutions, which will improve efficiencies across the acquisition workforce. The ODASA (PP&R) lacks analytic expertise to execute these tasks. <br>  <br> 2.1 Delivery Date:  December 2014 <br>  <br> 2.2 Delivery Period and Condition: Delivery Period is anticipated to start 4QFY15. <br>  <br> 2.3 Limitations: Not specified at this time.  <br>  <br> 2.4 Security Requirements:  Not specified at this time.  <br>  <br> 3.0  Requested Information  <br> The requested information is to gain an understanding of the respondents knowledge, experience and competencies in the following areas: <br>  <br> Developing PREDICTION STAFFING MODELS for Federal Government Acquisition functions. Functions modeled may include but are not limited to Program Management, Logistics, Contracting, Research & Development, Test, and Facilities Engineering functions. Information on each functional model should include the areas listed below, as appropiate: <br>  <br> Data Collection and Analysis Methods. Describe methods, procedures, and products used to develop prediction staffing models.   <br>  <br> Competency Modeling. Describe experience in, including, methods, procedures, and products, developing and integrating competencies into existing Prediction Staffing Models. For this response, competency is defined as the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to successfully perform the work required. The responses should also include information on sizes of populations modeled, level of effort required for each, and further explanations, as appropriate. If web-based software end products were developed as a part of the modeling efforts, please ensure responses identify them and summarize the capabilities provided.   <br>  <br> 4.0 Responses  <br> Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a whitepaper.  <br>  <br> 4.1 RFI Whitepaper. The RFI whitepaper should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 compatible format and due NLT OCT 14. The whitepaper response is limited to 5 single-sided pages and submitted via e-mail only to the Government Point of Contract (POC): paulette.a.mcgoldrick.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>  The RFI whitepaper should address the following:  <br>  <br> Proprietary information, if any, should be kept to minimum and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.  <br> To aid the Government, segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. If any respondee does not currently have a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement  (PDPA) that would permit the Government's personnel to review and evaluate the submitted whitepaper in response to this RFI, the respondee should request to sign PDPAs with the Government.  <br>  <br> Please note that all government or contractor personnel have executed Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA) for all project information related to the Human Capital Initiative.  <br> The RFI whitepaper should provide the following information:  <br>  <br> 1.Company Information. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact. <br>  <br>  2. Relevant Government work  <br> Contractual Vehicle Information. Identify  previous Government work in this area or other relevant efforts that will demonstrate overall capabilities  <br>  <br> 3.Proprietary Information. Identify and handle of respondee's company proprietary information should include either:  <br> 1) Copies of executed NDAs with the Government or  <br> 2) A statement stating the respondee will not allow the Government to release its proprietary data for the RFI whitepaper evaluation.  <br>  <br> 5.0 Meetings and Discussions  <br> The Government representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential RFI service provider. Such meetings and discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability, especially any development and certification risks.  <br>  <br> 6.0 Questions <br> Questions and the whitepaper regarding this RFI should be submitted in writing by e-mail to the designated POC. <br>  <br> 7.0 Summary <br> This RFI is only intended for the Government to identify sources that can provide the information requested. This RFI is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. The Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the RFI services discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  <br>  <br>

Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the following restrictive legend: PROPRIETARY. Include any explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.  <br>  <br> b.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. Where appropriate, use the following restrictive legends:  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> c.	The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.

Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.   <br>  <br> d.	Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.    <br>  <br> e.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.  <br>  <br> f.	The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating market-survey responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time. No response will be provided to requests for solicitation. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking capabilities statements related to the following:</p>
<p>DTRA is considering having an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Threat-Level Simulator (TLS) fabricated and is seeking companies with the capability to build such a piece of equipment. DTRA is willing to consider non-US companies for this fabrication. The last such EMP simulator was built for the US Navy in the 1990s and was known as EMPRESS II (see Figure 9, Baum: From EMP to HPE, http://ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0032.pdf). DTRA seeks a performer with capabilities to assist in the design, fabrication and field demonstration of the specified TLS. The TLS will be used to illuminate an aircraft carrier with a vertical EMP pulse. DTRA requests information on corporate past experience with similar projects and a rough-order-if-magnitude (ROM) cost estimate in US dollars. The TLS consists of the following key components from a ROM perspective: 1) pulser, radiating antenna and support equipment for the pulser and antenna (e.g., pulser diagnostics, free-field diagnostics for the EMP in the working volume, etc.) Please state critical assumptions used in preparing the ROM.</p>
<p>Specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; The TLS will illuminate an aircraft carrier where the electric field is incident on the broadside and is vertical to the water line.<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; The TLS waveform norms which must be met are as follows: 1) peak electric field, 2) 10-90 rise time and 3) root action integral. These norms will be the same as those for the pulse given in MIL-STD-464C Figure A-3 (http://www.assistdocs.com/search/search_basic.cfm). <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; The working volume of the TLS is defined to be a nuclear aircraft carrier with the EMP pulse incident broad side. Specifically, the working volume for the TLS is estimated to consist of a height = 250 ft. (waterline to top of mast), depth 252 ft. and a length (broadside) = 1,100 ft. <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Over the working volume of the TLS, all three norms (e.g., peak electric field is N1) will not vary by more than a factor of 2 (e.g., (N1Max - N1Min) &lt; 2N1 for the electric field). Another way to state this requirement is that each norm will have a maximum 2:1 variation over the working volume.<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; The TLS will be mounted on a barge capable of being used in the open seas. Specific environmental requirements are TBD, but it is expected to survive the same conditions an aircraft carrier might experience on the open seas.<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Instrumentation for measuring the TLS performance is required.<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Instrumentation for the response for approximately 100 test points on the aircraft carrier is required. For the aircraft carrier response, this corresponds to 100 simultaneous digitizing channels with a 10 kHz -1 GHz bandwidth.</p>
<p>Sources having the capability to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice. Responses should be limited to a four (4) page white paper in 12 point Courier New font, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents. Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such. Submitted data and information will not be returned. Any information submitted in response to this Request for Information Notice is strictly voluntary. This notice is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.</p>
<p>Electronic responses are required and shall be submitted to: michael.rooney@dtra.mil and Debra.mudd@dtra.mil. All emails should include in the subject line the Reference Number and the submitting organization's name. All documentation shall become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for same will be disregarded. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.</p>

<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the Support Ships, Boats, and Craft Program Office (PMS 325), seeking information from all potential sources who may be interested in supplying<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>commercially-available American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)- classed vessels capable of performing towing, salvage, and rescue missions. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Navy believes that there are several types of commercial vessels that may be able to perform these missions (including, but not limited to: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Anchor Handling Towing Supply vessels, Platform Supply Vessels, Multi-Mission or Multi-Purpose Service vessels, or other types of Offshore Support Vessels), but the Navy will consider any type of vessel meeting the requirements listed below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Navy's preference is to acquire vessels from potential sources with proven and mature ship designs; therefore, the Navy is interested only in responses for vessels that have been previously constructed, are currently in construction, or will be in construction within the next two years. The Navy's preference is for vessels built or being built in the U.S.; however, if vessels were built overseas, responses must clearly describe how that experience would be leveraged for construction in the U.S. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Navy is not interested at this time in concept designs without a demonstrated construction and operational history.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi">Cost of the vessels is of primary importance to the Navy, and respondents are requested to provide information concerning price of the vessels as indicated below.</span></p>
<p>For purposes of this request only, the Navy is contemplating acquiring 5 to 9 vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a basis for the response to this request, it should be assumed that the first vessel would be contracted for construction in the U.S. in the Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. However, if active production lines exist which the Navy could take advantage of, the first vessel could be contracted for as early as FY2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Emerging Technologies for First Responders Capability Gaps
<SOLNBR>RFI-15-04
<RESPDATE>121014
<CONTACT>Ramy Ghaly, Email Ramy.Ghaly@hq.dhs.gov - Sharon Flowers, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6816, Email Sharon.Flowers@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) is seeking information on emerging technologies that address challenges faced by the United States' first responder community. Information will be used to assess technologies' ability to provide a solution to previously identified high priority capability gaps, which are outlined below. The Government is considering hosting a demonstration and operational assessment of promising technologies in Fiscal Year 2015. Currently, only Government developed technologies are anticipated to be demonstrated, but the potential exists for privately developed technologies to be included as well. If it is determined that such technologies be included, a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be issued which will contain evaluation criteria and any agreement needed to further evaluate technology. Companies, educational institutions, laboratories and other organizations are invited to submit information on their products.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(c) and 5.205(c). Responses should be focused on the technology areas identified below and must be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or above. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI. Responses will be treated as information only. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted and the Government will not pay for any submission preparation/related costs.</p>
<p><br />Documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government invitation to the demonstration and operational assessment. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project.</p>
<p><br />Submissions should address one or more of the following capability gaps for law enforcement personnel, emergency management agencies, and public safety providers:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Situational Awareness: defined as the capability to obtain and distill specific knowledge concerning threats, hazards and conditions in a timely matter to support incident management decisions across all phases of a catastrophic incident response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to know the location of responders and their proximity to risks and hazards in real time. Geolocation of responders (identify their location on the incident scene tied to latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates or area-specific designations such as a street address), in all environments (in other words, indoors, outdoors and maritime), combined with simultaneous awareness of incident hazards.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to detect, monitor and analyze passive and active threats and hazards at incident scenes in real time. Remote monitoring of threats and hazards, combined effects assessment, and automated Red-Force tracking.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to rapidly identify hazardous agents and contaminants. This includes improved standoff detection and identification of multiple hazards, multi-sensor integration and analysis, and risk assessment and decision support to command.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to incorporate information from multiple and nontraditional sources,(for example, crowdsourcing and social media) into incident command operations.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Communications: defined as the capability to seamlessly and dynamically connect multiple persons or entities and convey meaningful and actionable information to all relevant parties.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to communicate with responders in any environmental conditions (including through barriers, inside buildings and underground). Improve communication systems to operate effectively in all environments, e.g. utilizing multi-sensory communications systems integrated with PPE; voice and data communications through all physical and electronic environments, and disaster resistant communications systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Communications systems that are hands free, ergonomically optimized, and can be integrated into PPE. Integrating communication means with PPE to reduce the number of devices responders have to carry as well as improving range and clarity.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Command Control and Coordination: defined as the ability to identify incident priorities, allocate scarce resources and exchange relevant information to make effective decisions in a stressful environment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to remotely monitor the tactical actions and progress of all responders involved in the incident in real time. Allocating responders in real time and integrating their actions into a workflow system remotely.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify trends, patterns and important content from large volumes of information from multiple sources (including nontraditional sources) to support incident decision-making system. This system should be capable of integrating large amounts of data, identifying emerging trends and patterns and filtering for key information.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify, assess and validate emergency-response-related software applications.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Responder Health, Safety and Performance: defined as the ability to identify hazards to public safety personnel and develop appropriate mitigations to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with response activities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Protective clothing and equipment for all responders that protect against multiple hazards, e.g. developing a modular mission-specific protective layers and wearable materials and systems that can easily decontaminated.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Logistics and resource management: defined as the ability to identify, acquire, track and distribute mission-specific equipment, supplies and personnel in support of catastrophic incident response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify what resources are available to support a response (including resources not traditionally involved in response), what their capabilities are and where they are, in real time). A logistic management system that allows resource data to be exchanged and provides a clear resource-related common operating picture to help allocate available responders.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to monitor in real time the status of resources and their functionality in current conditions, such as providing data concerning the functionality of specific resources that could improve the incident command's ability to make resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Casualty Management: defined as the ability to provide rapid and effective search and rescue, medical response, prophylaxis and decontamination for large numbers of incident casualties and identify appropriate sheltering, transportation and destination options.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to remotely scan incident scene for signs of life and decomposition to identify and locate casualties and fatalities. Need technologies capable of detecting signs of life or death, incident-specific casualty modeling and prediction, and integrating data and decisions made to model and predict incidents. Improve the indoor, outdoor and subsurface casualty geolocation capability.</p>
<p><br />All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Therefore, do not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI. Specific information sought includes:</p>
<p><br />1. Company information, including name, address, point of contact, URL, and the number of employees.<br />2. A point of contact for follow-up information, and the point of contact's phone number and e-mail address.<br />3. Product name, capability gap(s) addressed, brief description, operational context(s), and specifications.<br />4. Cost information, such as purchase price and General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information, if available.</p>
<p><br />No feedback will be given on any of the product submission. The point of contact may be contacted following submission for more detailed product information.</p>
<p><br />Submittals<br />Only electronically submitted submissions will be accepted. The Government will answer all written questions, and requests for clarification regarding this posting. No telephone calls will be accepted. Submissions, questions, and written requests for clarification shall be submitted to the following point of contact: Ramy Ghaly (Ramy.Ghaly@hq.dhs.gov).</p>

<DESC>Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) for Architect-Engineer Services - National Geospatial Intelligence Agency(NGA) West Facilities Modernization (WFM) program. W912DQ-15-R-4004 <br>  <br> The following is a Sources Sought Notice.  The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330 (Engineering Services) and 541310 Architectural services. The small business size standard is $7.5 million and $15 million respectively. This Sources Sought announcement is for market research information only and is to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested and none will be accepted in response to this notice.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE, nor does it restrict the  <br> Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. The estimated capacity for this IDC is not to exceed $100 million with a maximum duration through the completion of construction and turn over. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District seeks qualified Architect and Engineering (A-E) firms interested and capable of providing A-E services (NAICS code 541330 and 541310) to support the planning, design, construction, and operation of a replacement campus for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's  <br> (NGA) 2nd Street St. Louis facilities known as the West Facilities Modernization (WFM) program. The project is tentatively programmed for construction in the late FY17 through FY21 timeframe and would consist of one site in the metropolitan St. Louis area.  The planning and design efforts are planned to begin in late FY15.   <br> The site has not been selected.   <br> The campus complex would consist of the following facilities/improvements: <br>  <br> a. Secure Analysis Facility (approx 800,000 sf)   <br> b. Central Utilities Plant (approx 38,000 sf) <br> c. Structured Parking (approx 1,000,000 sf) <br> d. Visit Control Center (VCC) (approx 7,300 sf) <br> e. Remote Vehicle/Truck Inspection Facility (approx 6,500 sf) <br> f. Police Command Center (approx 10,000 sf) <br> g. Associated Site improvements (roads, utilities, landscaping, etc) <br> h. Installation of FF&E, IO&T, and Installation of Secure Mission Production Equipment. <br>  <br> WFM Requirement:   <br> The WFM campus is required to replace mission critical facilities in St. Louis that have exceeded their service life.  The project will accommodate new technologies and processes that will generate beneficial synergies through integration, collaboration, and geospatial data immersion.  The 'purpose-built' facility  <br> will provide an open flexible work environment that is scalable, reconfigurable, and adaptive to changing mission requirements and the associated changes in workflow and data sharing methodologies.  The project will provide NGA's workforce with safe, secure, and efficient facilities that will meet the agency's long-term  <br> requirements and vision for Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) and will be consistent with the Director National Intelligence (DNI) facilities strategic plan. <br>     <br> Anticipated Scope of Services:  The Government anticipates issuing an IDIQ professional services contract for the services described in this announcement.  The anticipated types of services are architectural engineering technologies; architectural and engineering analyses and designs; preparation of construction  <br> plans/specifications; independent commissioning services; and construction cost estimates.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for 47-foot Motor Lifeboat (MLB) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Acquisition Strategy:<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a multi-mission organization tasked with maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. One of the components for providing this capability in the coastal zone is the 47' MLB, which is self-righting and is capable of operating in up to 20 foot surf and 30 foot open ocean waves. The 47' MLB is constructed of marine grade aluminum and has twin-diesel engine propulsion with fixed-pitch propellers that provide a top speed of 25 knots. The first production 47' MLB entered service in 1997, and the last was delivered in 2003. Please see attachment for an overview of the 47' MLB.<br /><br />The 47' MLB are in need of a major renovation to extend their service life primarily due to system obsolesce and reliability issues. The major tasks include:<br /><br />- Propulsion System Replacement (Diesel Engine, Reversing Reduction Gear, and Prop only; rest of components to be retained)<br />- Ship's Service Alternator Replacement<br />- Crew Seating Replacement<br />- Steering Gear Replacement<br />- Tow Reel Replacement<br />- Fender System Replacement<br />- Removable Deck Plate Replacement<br />- UHF/VHF Direction Finder Replacement<br />- Navigation System Replacement<br />- Remote Control Spotlight<br />- Machinery Space CO2 System Replacement<br />- Auxiliary Machinery Space Fan Replacement<br />- Rudder Replacement<br />- HVAC Chiller &amp; Raw Water Pump Replacement<br />- Window Wiper Replacement<br />- Quick Acting Watertight Hatch Replacement<br /><br />None of these modifications are intended to increase the operational capability of the boats, but will primarily consist of one-for-one replacement of existing systems and equipment. These modifications should not negatively affect the operational characteristics of the boat. The USCG has initiated a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to execute these upgrades. There are a total of 117 of the 47' MLB's currently in the Coast Guard fleet, of which, up to 114 could be inducted into the SLEP. <br /><br />This notice is an RFI&nbsp;to gauge industry's capabilities and interest as well as a market research effort to identify the proper procurement strategy to minimize risk for both parties and to maximize efficiency in fulfilling this requirement. The USCG is looking to award a fixed price, Requirements contract to a single Contractor to provide the major pieces of equipment necessary to complete the SLEP along with the associated engineering, on-site technical support, and logistics support, including drawing updates. The largest modification will be the replacement of the main diesel engines. The NAICS code for this requirement is 336611, and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.<br /><br />The USCG intends to provide a Performance Work Statement (PWS) outlining the requirements for all boat modifications. The USCG may also develop a point design to prove the feasibility of the modifications and confirm that multiple equipment vendors are available. If provided, the point design will not identify equipment by name/model. From this PWS, potential bidders will provide technical proposals that identify specific pieces of equipment that will meet the performance requirements, arrangement drawings that show how all new equipment will be fit onto the boat, a notional weight and moment report showing that the proposed package will not impact weight limitations, a trim &amp; stability analysis showing that the new/relocated equipment will not affect the boats self-righting capability, and an electric power and load analysis showing overall power impacts. The Government will provide drawings and existing technical data as GFI. The Government intends to use a best value, trade-off&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis to evaluate the proposals and award a FFP contract with multiple option years, not to exceed five (5) years.<br />&nbsp;<br />After award, the Contractor would perform detailed engineering and design to incorporate the proposed equipment. Engineering changes would likely be a part of this design process, but these would be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The deliverables at this phase would be work packages consisting of work specifications, modification drawings, and production cost estimates. This information would be used to award a production contract to have a shipyard execute the modifications and install all equipment provided by the Contractor. The Contractor will also provide all technical documentation (including a list of all Original Equipment Manufacturer part numbers) and prepare lifecycle documents for the post-SLEP 47' MLB. <br /><br />The USCG intends to perform the SLEP on one 47' MLB at the Coast Guard Yard as a prototype to verify &amp; validate the Contractor's work packages and proposed system modifications. Under the contract, the Contractor would be responsible for providing all major pieces of equipment for the prototype availability, and technical oversight during the availability period to ensure proper installation of all systems. The contract will include a prototype evaluation period for Coast Guard evaluation. <br /><br />The Government's intent is for the base period of the contract to include the design of all systems, the corresponding modification work packages, all technical support documentation, and the delivery of equipment to the USCG Yard for the prototype availability. After successful completion of the prototype evaluation, the contract will be structured to have the Contractor provide complete equipment packages delivered on an "as-needed" basis in the form of delivery/task orders issued against an Indefinite Delivery, Requirements Contract for an estimated qty. of 114 boats as well as spare components for life-cycle support. The work packages developed by the Contractor will be used by the USCG to award shipyard availability contracts to the USCG Yard or commercial boat/shipyards for execution of the upgrades. The Contractor would be responsible for timely delivery of all equipment and engineering support during boat/shipyard availabilities for the remainder of the contract. <br /><br />To summarize, the intended scope of supply would be:<br /><br />a) Base Period (firm fixed price):<br />a. One ship set of equipment identified in the proposal<br />b. Engineering calculations for all designs (propulsion, electrical, structural , etc)<br />c. Detailed design work packages (modification drawings, work instruction, and production estimates)<br />d. Equipment technical documentation<br />e. On-site technical support/oversight<br />f. Pre-production modifications based on the results of Operational Testing &amp; Evaluation<br /><br />b) Option Periods (firm fixed price); one per boat for up to 114 boats:<br />a. One ship set of equipment<br />b. On-site technical support/oversight<br /><br />This is not a Solicitation, and proposals are not being requested at this time. Furthermore, there is&nbsp;not an anticipated date for release of a Solicitation at this point. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of Contractor's information. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted.<br /><br />Questions for Response:<br /><br />1) If the USCG was to provide the point design as Government Furnished Information, how would this impact industry's ability to develop a technical proposal? Alternatively, if it was not provided, how would that affect industry's capability to provide a proposal?<br /><br />2) Would the scope and structure of the proposed approach be feasible in the assessment of industry? What are the perceived risks, and how could the USCG modify or improve this approach to limit risk for both parties?<br /><br />3) The offerors would need to perform some level of engineering design and analysis in order to develop their proposal since the equipment identified in the proposal would become part of the fixed price contract. Would the level of design required to specify all pieces of equipment be feasible to offerors, given the potential scope of this requirement?<br /><br />4) Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm, fixed price for the Base Period described above? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase confidence and establish firm, fixed prices?<br /><br />5) Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm, fixed price for follow-on Option periods to provide equipment packages in support of boat/shipyard availabilities? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase offeror's confidence?

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for proposal. There will not be a solicitation issued at this time. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8 has a requirement for Industrial Hygiene and Environmental  Services Support for facilities, construction, alteration, remodeling, and repair of buildings, structures and  projects with hazardous or regulated materials at the C.W. Bill Young VA Medical Center, Bay Pines, FL. 
The intent of the project is to award an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Task Order Contract.
The project will consist of providing Industrial Hygiene Quality Assurance oversight (third-party) as the Government's independent VA Professional Certified Industrial Hygienist (VPCIH). The VPCIH is needed for emergency response to a disturbance of regulated materials, renovation and/or remodeling projects with hazardous or regulated materials, to include asbestos containing materials (ACM), lead containing materials (LCM), polychlorinated biphenyls containing materials (PCB) and mercury containing materials (MCM) present in which the VA Professional Industrial Hygienist (VPIH) is independent of the A/E or outside contractor and hired separately by the VA. The VPCIH will evaluate the general Contractor's removal of asbestos containing
materials (ACM) and/or lead paint containing materials. These special instructions cover the VPIH services associated with hazardous or regulated materials for the Schematics, Design Development and the Construction Documents stages of the VA design process and the construction period services of a project and may include maintenance operations performed by VA staff.  The VPIH is not only required to have the experience and expertise of all aspects of hazardous material abatement and remediation but also have experience working as a member of a design team.
Only firms within 50 miles (or with branches within 50 miles) of the C.W Bill Young VA Medical Center will be considered for award of this contract, as one of the essential elements of performance is emergency response and site visits during construction services, which are often not scheduled far in advance and may need to occur on very short notice to avoid delays in construction performance.
The applicable NAICS code that may be included, but is not limited to, is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $15.0 million. All contract work will be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects. These task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees. The term of the IDIQ Contract will be a one (1)-year Base Period from date of award, not to exceed $1 Million. Each task order will have its own completion date established. 
This notice is published to conduct market research to determine if there is a sufficient
number of certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) capable of performing the requirements to warrant a solicitation set-aside.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of clinac linear accelerator maintenance services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. Business size standard for NAICS 811219 is $20.5M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Varian Medical Systems, 2250 Newmarket Pkwy, Suite 120, Marietta, Georgia 30067. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 12:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 10 November 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Varian Medical Systems currently owns the proprietary rights to the clinac linear accelerator that requires service and maintenance. The linear accelerator is manufactured by Varian Medical Systems and therefore can only be serviced by Varian Medical Systems.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to caitlin.williams.6@us.af.mil no later than 12:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 10 November 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0028, Linear Accelerator." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC><p>Since 2007, the Air Force CRP (previously CPP) program has held "technology match" meetings for Program Executive Officer organizations. The AF Transition Support Program indentifies small businesses with Phase II SBIR/STTR projects to participate in these meetings by data mining DOD SBIR/STTR databases against AF center technology-based needs. In 2008, the Air Force initiated "technology match" meetings focusing on technology-based needs of individual major contractors. The technology-based needs concept is effective and beneficial to both the Government and Industry. <br /><br />Air Force is now soliciting major contractors to participate in technology match meetings for 2015. In similar fashion to other Air Force CRP meetings, facilitation of one-on-one sessions between small businesses and the host major contractor will occur. The government team will help facilitate these one-on-one sessions. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Response to this request is voluntary and will not have influence on any future acquisitions.</p>

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) Contracting Division, Army Contracting Command (ACC), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Chelton, Inc; 1955 Lakeway Drive; Lewisville, Texas 75057, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source.  The proposed contract action, a commercial item purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12, is for procurement of two hundred fifty (250) VHF/UHF Antenna Electronic Shielding Gaskets, P/N: 6930A/9-33-26.  The purchase order will be issued on a Firm-Fixed-Price basis.  Delivery is expected within 12 weeks after receipt of order. <br>  <br> This order will be for two hundred and fifty (250) VHF/UHF Antenna Electronic Shielding Gaskets, P/N: 6930A/9-33-26 for the Chelton 9-33-26P antenna installation in association with the ARC-231 Communication Kits. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate has the responsibility, as directed by PM-AME, to fabricate and assemble the 'stand alone' communications upgrade kits for a number of deploying UH-60 helicopters for ARC-231 radio installation.   The proposed vendor, Chelton, Inc, is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the required VHF/UHF Antenna Electronic Shielding Gaskets.  Based upon discussion and coordination to ascertain compatibility with existing antenna mounting methods approved for installation on the UH-60 and comparable performance, the Chelton 6930A/9-33-26 antenna electronic shielding gasket provides known performance with no technical risk for the Chelton 9-33-26P antenna sealing/bonding application required for establishing LOS communication links for the intended area of operations. Therefore, this commercially available antenna gasket has airworthiness approval for application with the ARC-231 Kit supporting a limited number of fielded UH-60 rotorcraft engaged in contingency operations. This specific gasket is specified in the Army TM's and cannot be substituted. <br>  <br> No request for quotes/proposals will be posted.

We will be holding focus groups with FBO users to understand their goals and experiences with federal opportunities.   To initiate these conversations, IAE is asking that FBO users who would like to provide input to answer this brief FBO User Survey.  Through the survey, we will gather a preliminary understanding of the various FBO users as a basis for focus group planning.<br />Responses are due Friday, November 14. <br /><br />(Survey link should be pasted into browser: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11HNZjsL1fJ8J9ikTFDpLxv0-6b68-jmRZCcEQny5cXM/viewform<br /> <br />IAE aims to develop a detailed understanding of a diverse set of user perspectives- from throughout government and industry. This understanding will be crucial to successful design and development to ensure the future of robust and transparent federal-wide competitions for all procurement opportunities and entities seeking to do business. <br />Half-day focus groups will be held from December, 2014 through March, 2015 with options to attend in-person in Washington, D.C. or to participate virtually.  Focus group participation may not be available to all survey respondents; IAE's Interact Industry Community (https://interact.gsa.gov/group/integrated-award-environment-iae-industry-community) will be updated with additional opportunities to offer user feedback.
<p>FBO will be the first system to be built in the new integrated environment- which gradually -through fiscal year 2018- will incorporate 10 government-wide  procurement and grant data systems:  FBO, CFDA, eSRS, FSRS, FAPIIS, PPIRS, CPARS, WDOL, FPDS and SAM.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Academy of Science's (NAS) Transportation Research Board (TRB) to provide support services for technical assistance and information dissemination to the public transportation community.&nbsp; The period of performance will be for one year, with an option for an additional year.<br /><br />The justification is as follows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; The long established status of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) as a noncompetitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government derives from its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by E.O. 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the NAS was most recently formally recommended in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to Government and its unique capacity to martial scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science policy advice. The NAS has the unique ability to assemble the Nation's most eminent scholars, who serve as volunteers without compensation on committees and boards, which are then able to render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national problems of high priority. Accordingly, only NAS can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity and audience acceptance necessary to meet our program requirements.<br /></span><br />NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ryan Daniels, at <a href="mailto:ryan.daniels@dot.gov">ryan.daniels@dot.gov</a>.

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS.GOV Announcement: Special Notice
<p>Subject: for the purchase of renewing a ESI CRD-ACE license plus software maintenance</p>
<p>Reference Number: NB184000-15-00023</p>
<p>Date: October 30, 2014</p>
<p>Contact Points: Sajurnia Harris, Purchasing Agent sajurnia.harris@nist.gov<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer todd.hill@nist.gov</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source</p>
<p>Description: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Information Systems Management (OISM), intends to award, on a sole-source basis. Under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), with ESI North America Farmington Hills, MI.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a need to ensure the licenses are renewed on-time for OISM to provide scientific software services to the NIST community.</p>
<p>Background: <br />NIST computing Infrastructure supports a number of commercial scientific and mathematical computing software that are centrally managed by OISM. These scientific applications require annual license maintenance, technical support, and product upgrade on site. NIST has been using the ESI CFD-ACE plus software for at least the last 8 years.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement:<br />The purpose of the contract is to: Provide NIST with an ESI CFD-ACE plus software license and maintenance renewal, which gives NIST the right to continue using the software for one year.<br />Provide technical support during the period of performance, Provide upgrades and enhancements-fixes during the period of performance.<br />ESI Group is the copyright holder and sole source for maintenance and support of the ESI-CFD scientific software product. The current ESI CFD-ACE plus software products are critical to the success of NIST researchers and their work. The institutional knowledge that has been built using this product all these years will be extremely difficult to replace. Without the continued maintenance renewal, the important research work will be interrupted.</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, for this acquisition is 511210 software publishers and the size standard is $35.5 in millions of dollars. <br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to ESI North America for this requirement, for a period of performance of one year. <br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the renewal maintenance may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before November 11, 2014 at 1 pm EST.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Sajurnia Harris at sajurnia.harris@nist.gov .</p>

<p>Market research was conducted at initial time of award and Mr. Ulrich continues to be the only responsible source to meet the Agency's needs based on his unique expertise, experience and the Agency's adoption of the recommendations from Mr. Ulrich's report Patent Business / IT Transformation Strategy Assessment Report.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich is the inventor and expert in The Systems Redevelopment Methodology (TSRM) adopted by the USPTO. This methodology was provided to the USPTO in FY2010 and 2011 and Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise in this methodology allows the USPTO to continue this work with the Patent Business.

He has a superlative set of qualifications as a business strategist relating to business value definition, software development methodologies and legacy system migration.

(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)

(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of OffersCommercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:
52.212-2 Addendum:
Evaluation Criteria.  The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations.  By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors.  All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.  Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.  Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:
(a)  FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable.  Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award.  The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:
		
		Subfactor 1  Provider Capability 
This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.  Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.

Subfactor 2  Local Communications Services. 
This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offerors ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.  Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.

(b)  FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.  All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.  The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.  

(c)  FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE.  In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including:  reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated.  When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offerors ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation.  The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:  
			(A)  Substantial Confidence  Based on the Offerors performance record, the 					Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the 				required effort.
			(B)Satisfactory Confidence Based on the Offerors performance record, the 					Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required 				effort. 
			(C) Limited Confidence Based on the Offerors performance record, the Government 				has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  
	(D) No Confidence Based on the Offerors performance record, the Government has no 	expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
			(E) Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable, or the Offerors 				performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably 				assigned.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for 				whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated 			favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).
The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of Satisfactory Confidence or lower.  If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a Substantial Confidence 	performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to 	the Government.  If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.

<p><strong>Government Evaluation:<br /></strong>The Government will award a contract to the <em>lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror</em> whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Capability:</span> In order to be considered technically capable offerors must make clear their capability to meet the requirements in the statement of work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of capability to maintain and repair fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, pre-reaction systems, or fire extinguishers will make the offer technically unacceptable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Lack of experience with Siemens fire products will make the offer technically unacceptable and ineligible for award. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A lack of demonstrated ability to meet the required 2 hour emergency response time will make the offeror technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span> The Government will verify the offeror demonstrated minimum 3 years' experience in maintaining fire protection systems of a similar size (or larger) than those contemplated under this combined synopsis/soliciation. DMEA will contact offerors previous customers to verify how successful the offeror's firm was in servicing the identified fire protection systems under those contracts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of experience with comparable projects will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Unsatisfactory performance on previous contracts will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span> Quotes will be evaluated to ensure that all labor rates proposed are consistent with industry practices and historical prices paid by the Government for similar services. The Government will verify that the number of hours proposed for completing preventative maintenance work is consistent with industry practices and the Government's experience on similar work.</p>
<p><strong>Representations and Certifications: </strong>To be eligible for contract award, vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM): <a href="http://www.SAM.gov">www.SAM.gov</a>. If not registered at this time, vendors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quote. If a prospective successful offeror cannot become registered by two (2) weeks after the date proposals are due, their quote will be considered non-responsive and award will be made to the next lowest-priced technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Because DMEA is a secure facility, DMEA staff will escort all maintenance workers around the facility and during performance. Upon completion, the COR will inspect all work to ensure all maintenance was performed, all necessary repairs were made, and that the system is functioning properly. When remedial emergency maintenance is required, DMEA will contact the contractor to schedule the repair work. If the Government determines that the cause of any needed repairs is the fault of the contractor, the repairs shall be made at no cost to the Government.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for purchase of a One Year Repair Coverage Service Contract starting January 1, 2015 for three PerkinElmer instruments. Scope and Capabilities: Repair Coverage Service Contract are necessary to ensure that these instruments are operating at their optimum performance and to ensure that they are maintained in a safe condition.  The instructions are: Optima 5300 D (2 ea) and one NexION 300 D ICP-MS.  The requirements for all instruments on Repair Coverage Service include: Service calls are given priority status over non-service agreement holders, all parts (excluding consumables), labor, and travel expenses of the field service engineer to maintain instruments in normal working operation, and free telephone troubleshooting and technical support. NO SOLICIATION OR REQUREST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE:  PerkinElmer is the company that manufactures the listed instruments and is the best source of service for all.  Performance issues are best known by the service engineers of the manufacturing company.  In addition, this kind of information is distributed to PerkinElmer service engineers as a service data bulletin.  Service engineers from PerkinElmer are more informed about any developing problems and the subsequent repairs or replacement parts needed in order to repair and improve these instruments as a result of their access to these service bulletins.  A service provider other than PerkinElmer may not be able to readily access this information or even acquire any service issue updates relevant to the instrument.  All PerkinElmer service engineers have access to applications specialists in their instrumentation area and are able to contact the design engineers for the specific instrument to discuss problems and find solutio ns.  Open access to such application and design expertise would not be available through another service provider.  Furthermore, PerkinElmer service engineers have extensive training in the instrument software systems.  Since these instruments are now controlled by software commands, it is critical that a service provider have a complete understanding of the software.  Any other service provider not the manufacturer may not have complete knowledge of this software.  Lastly, a rapid service response time is necessary for all of these instruments systems.  PerkinElmer has a local service engineer with an excellent service response record making it unlikely that there would be excessive instument down-time. Nothwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA"s announcments, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely with in the discretion of the  Government.  All questions should be directed to Sheila Fagan via email at fagan.sheila@epa.gov no later than 5:00 pm EST, November 10, 2014. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government&rsquo;s requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract. (h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis. (End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1) (ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers&mdash;Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision: 52.212-2 Addendum: Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors&rsquo; past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: (a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors: Subfactor 1 &ndash; Provider Capability This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort. Subfactor 2 &ndash; Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror&rsquo;s ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10. (b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. (c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror&rsquo;s ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: (A) Substantial Confidence &ndash; Based on the Offeror&rsquo;s performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (B)Satisfactory Confidence &ndash;Based on the Offeror&rsquo;s performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (C) Limited Confidence &ndash;Based on the Offeror&rsquo;s performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (D) No Confidence &ndash;Based on the Offeror&rsquo;s performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. (E) Unknown Confidence &ndash;No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror&rsquo;s performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)). The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of &ldquo;Satisfactory Confidence&rdquo; or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a &ldquo;Substantial Confidence&rdquo; performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of this amendment is to update language of the PWS and to the Basis for Award:&nbsp;Factor 1.&nbsp; All changes are underlined...see attached PWS sections 5.74 &amp; 5.75 and evaluation Factor 1.</span><br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard has a requirement for contractor support services to obtain external accreditation services for a total of 35 Coast Guard ambulatory health care clinics located across the USCG enterprise in the United States and applicable territories.
<p>Services will include, but will not be limited to: providing advice and expertise; conducting surveys; providing written reports of each clinic survey based on established standards set forth in the contract organizations standards handbook; providing certification documentation and providing training to selected clinic/organizational staff in person or via webcast annually as determined by the USCG Health, Safety, and Work-Life Service Center (HSWL SC). The contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, facilities, and material/equipment to conduct the External Accreditation Surveys for Ambulatory Health Care Clinics in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), which is attached.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with <br />the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes only the solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-15-R-P1C000 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This RFP incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-76. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 813920 with a small business size standard of $15M and is issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. The deadline for submitting a proposal package is: Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 2:00 PM, local time.</p>
<p>It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only once responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>
<p>NOTE: The clinics are surveyed typically on three year rotations. Locations of health care clinics and approximate timeframes for surveys are available in the attached spreadsheet, which is to be used for pricing as well. All contract line items shall be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP). The period of performance will be one year from date of award with four one year option periods. The anticipated contract start is January 2015.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998). This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov. A completed copy of the provision, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009) should be included with the offer. Offerors are required to submit on-line Reps &amp; Certs (see https://orca.bpn.gov/).</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Apr 2014). The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:</p>
<p>Note 1: The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(End of addendum)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1) FACTOR 1: Technical Approach - will be evaluated to determine the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of the PWS (to include the dispute management process) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with surveyors who are trained and experienced in conducting surveys in facilities that are similar to Coast Guard Health Care facilities.</span></p>
<p>2) FACTOR 2: Relevant Past Performance - will be evaluated for relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, and customer satisfaction. Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information. Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered. Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement. Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.</p>
<p>3) Price: The offeror's proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)</p>
<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: <br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (May 2014)</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause: <br />52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) <br />52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (Mar 1989)<br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) (insert 30 days)<br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (insert 10 days, 15 days, <br />5 years);</p>

<p>COMMANDANT CG-9121(WS)<br />U.S. COAST GUARD <br />2703 MARTIN LUTHER KING JR AVE SE<br />WASHINGTON, DC 20593-7828</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

<p>3.  CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: December 3, 2014, 5:00 PM EST</p>
<p>4.  POSITION TITLE:  Executive Officer (Multiple Positions)</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-15 equivalent hourly/daily rate ($48.21 - $62.68/$385.68 - $501.44 - not eligible for locality pay).  Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) year, with four (4) option years</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Crisis Surge Support Staff (CS3), formerly the Office of Civilian Response (OCR), "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her CS3 supervisor in consultation with the Overseas Management Division (M/MS/OMD) according to requests made to CS3 by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC. There is no obligation by CS3 to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, CS3 will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to CS3 or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify CS3 whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify CS3 at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist CS3 in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from CS3 and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Overseas<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training, as required, in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training and security training. After completion of appropriate training, the Executive Officer will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Crisis Surge Support Staff (CS3), formerly the Office of Civilian Response (OCR), is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, internal conflict or otherwise in need of surge staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, CS3 provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo, and many other countries. As a member of CS3's team of crisis responders, you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.</p>
<p>USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to internal and external crises. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing. Yet timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. CS3 plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs, CS3 retains a group of high level professionals and experts under (USPSCs intermittent contracts) as part of a "Firehouse". These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are rapidly available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, replace evacuated staff, or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. CS3 staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach, reporting, strategic planning, and others. As a member of the "Firehouse" you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The  Executive Officer will assist USAID Missions with the full range of administrative services including personnel management, procurement (GLAAS), ICASS, Travel (E-2) general services (leasing, non-expendable property [NXP], expendable property [EXP], etc.), records management, reviewing Mission EXO operations to identify management vulnerabilities, and work with Missions to correct vulnerabilities - including mentoring recently assigned EXOs, and training FSN/PSC and US/PSC staff to increase their competencies and capabilities.</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to plan and carry out administrative programs that are vital to USG interests in the country of assignment and in the Region. The work involves determining the soundness of Mission management of programs and plans; developing and establishing new approaches and methods for use by the Mission of assignment and/or Missions throughout the Region; resolving problems that are critical to the accomplishment of important Agency objectives; providing authoritative advice and technical assistance to the Mission; or, developing or revising standards for use in developing and administering Mission programs.  The Interim Executive Officer's recommendations affect programs that are essential to the long-term mission of the Agency.</p>
<p>The work includes broad functions and processes found in USAID Executive Offices worldwide, including a wide variety of duties requiring many different and unrelated processes and methods applied to a broad range of activities, or intensive analysis and problem-solving.  Assignments are characterized by unusual breadth, and normally involve several phases of the work being pursued concurrently with support from within and outside the organization.  Decisions regarding what needs to be done include largely undefined issues and elements, requiring extensive analysis to determine the nature and scope of problems encountered.  The work requires the Interim Executive Officer to establish new concepts, theories, or programs and considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Executive Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Interacting with senior Mission management to implement Mission policies and procedures governing Mission operations, particularly where Mission-specific guidance is not developed.<br />&#9679;	Consulting with Missions on their Executive Office procurement services, including GLAAS, insuring that procurement activities are in accordance with the FAR and AIDAR, and reducing vulnerabilities.<br />&#9679;	Identifying problems in Missions' current records management operations and designing training programs to develop the skills and competencies of staffs charged with these responsibilities.<br />&#9679;	Reviewing General Services Operations (GSO), identifying weaknesses in Mission GSO operations, and recommending/taking remedial actions.  Where the Missions receive services under ICASS, insure the highest levels of customer service are provided.<br />&#9679;	Insuring adequate controls are in place to track personal and real property and advising staff on the use of property management programs.  Where Missions receive services under ICASS, insure the highest levels of customer service are provided.<br />&#9679;	Reviewing security programs in place, including radio programs, physical security of office buildings and homes, and warden systems.<br />&#9679;	Insuring motor pool operations are adequate for Mission needs, and controls are in place to prevent misuse of USG vehicles and resources.  Where Missions receive services under ICASS, insure the highest levels of customer service are provided.<br />&#9679;	Reviewing office space for adequacy of maintenance programs, safety, and health programs. <br />&#9679;	Providing closeout support to Missions, including review of and input into closeout plans. (Closeout support may require lengthy deployments during the final months of any Mission closeout.)<br />&#9679;	Supporting start-up missions to set up Executive Office services.<br />&#9679;	Identifying management vulnerabilities in Missions through formal Management Services Reviews, and providing hands-on support in correcting deficiencies.<br />&#9679;	Assisting Missions in reviewing ICASS subscriptions, budgets, and other issues as well as reviewing OE budgets and procurement plans.<br />&#9679;	Providing coverage during absence of assigned Executive Officers.</p>
<p>In Missions with no USDH or US/PSC Executive Officer, the Executive Officer will provide support to assure that EXO operations are running smoothly.</p>
<p>The Executive Officer, from time to time, will assume the role of "mentor" to new USDH EXOs assigned to missions.  Specifically, the Executive Officer will provide training and guidance to the new EXOs in order to meet the following objectives:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Improve and expand technical subject matter expertise in BS-03.<br />&#9679;	Obtain an in-depth understanding of the EXO functions in relation to US foreign assistance delivery, concentrating on USAID's structure and functions both internally and externally with implementers, host country governments and other donors.<br />&#9679;	Experience and gain an understanding of the overseas work environment and institutional culture of USAID.<br />&#9679;	Strengthen the officers' inter-cultural skills both within the work place and the local environment.<br />&#9679;	Expand the officers' management and leadership skills.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP AND CONTROLS: The Executive Officer will take administrative direction from the Director of CS3 or his/her designee; technical assistance (EXO subject matter expertise) will be provided by the M/MS/OMD.  While on assignment, the Executive Officer will report to a mission-based supervisor designated by the Field Mission. The supervisor at the USAID mission will set overall objectives and provide technical direction and day-to-day supervision.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished subject to mission approval and consistent with mission objectives, policies, and protocols. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision while remaining in line with agreed upon work plans and overall mission objectives. For the purpose of contract, personnel, training or general administrative matters, the CS3 Director (Washington, DC) or his/her designee will provide direction and oversight.</p>
<p>The Executive Officer is expected to work with a high degree of independence.  As a recognized authority in a wide variety of typical Executive Officer programs or functional areas, the incumbent has complete responsibility and authority to plan, design, schedule, and carry out major programs/projects, studies, or other work independently.  The incumbent typically exercises discretion and judgment in determining whether to broaden or narrow the scope of programs/projects or studies.  Completed work is reviewed primarily for potential influence on broad USAID and/or Mission policy and goals, fulfillment of objectives, or contribution to advancement of knowledge in the field, and is normally accepted without significant change.  Recommendations for new activities are usually evaluated only for such considerations as availability of funds and other resources, broad Agency goals, or Mission priorities.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of broadly stated and nonspecific policy statements, statutes, court decisions, etc., that require extensive interpretation.  The incumbent uses judgment and discretion in determining the intent of existing policy, and in interpreting and revising existing policy and regulatory guidance for use by others within or outside USAID and the Mission (e.g., other Executive Officers, technical subject-matter experts, USAID/Washington staffs, and host-country officials).  The incumbent is recognized as an authority in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on Mission support activities and administration.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>Firehouse members must obtain a Class 1 State Department medical clearance. CS3 Firehouse members may be in positions overseas that lead to unusual mental stress, and may require arduous physical exertion, by prolonged standing, by riding in and getting out of vehicles, and by operating manual or stick-shift motor vehicles. The duties may require: entering and maneuvering in facilities accessible only by stairs, long flight times, and carrying heavy baggage and items (over 30 pounds). The incumbent must be able to operate in an environment that requires endurance and ability to evaluate surroundings. Applicants must be physically and mentally capable of performing these functions efficiently and safely.</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting, though the contractor is likely to be assigned to areas where site visits and extraordinary travel time is involved and that may entail working out of temporary duty residences or hotel rooms. The contractor will travel as a U.S. government employee and is subject to Chief of Mission authority. As such, the contractor will be expected to conform to all embassy and/or USAID mission policies and procedures at his or her assignment location regarding housing, work hours, diplomatic protocols, and security. The contractor may be required to staff field offices or other locations off-site of the USAID mission or embassy. Many of the overseas environments in which the contractor may be required to work present a health risk such as: extreme air pollution, lack of potable water, or presence of waterborne and other communicable diseases. Special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, exposure to severe weather conditions, working in non-permissive environments, restrictions on movement and/or evacuations of a USAID mission or embassy may occur.</p>

When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 6pt 0in">The JSTARS Recap Weapon System solution will incorporate currently available technology to recapitalize the JSTARS Battle Management, Command and Control (BMC2) Mission and the Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) capability on a smaller, more efficient airframe, thereby reducing life cycle costs of the weapon system. The JSTARS Recap Program Office will contract for the delivery of a complete integrated weapon system solution, as opposed to holding separate competitions for individual weapon subsystems for subsequent integration. The overall Weapon System will be comprised of the following industry integrated subsystems: the aircraft, the sensor(s), a communications suite, and a BMC2 suite. The JSTARS Recap Weapon System solution will integrate high technology readiness level (TRL) components, and will utilize an Open Systems Architecture (OSA) to reduce integration risk and lifecycle cost.</p>

<DESC><br /><br />Solicitation Number: <br />FA9401-15-R-8003, Modeling and Simulation for Air Force Nuclear Weapon Systems and Counter-Chemical and Biological
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought, Request for Information</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />NOTE: All correspondence must be submitted to the Contracting POCs.</p>
<p>1. Part: U.S. Government Procurements</p>
<p>2. Subpart: Engineering Services</p>
<p>3. Product/Service Code: B541</p>
<p>4. Agency: Department of the Air Force</p>
<p>5. Responsible Office and Address: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Directorate, Installation Support Contracting Division, Specialized Branch (PZID), 8500 Gibson Blvd SE, Bldg 20202, Kirtland AFB NM 87117</p>
<p>6. Notice Type: Sources Sought - Statement of Capabilities (SOC)</p>
<p>7. Description of the efforts needed are included in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS): AFNWC/PZID is contracting for Engineering tasks required to support sustainment and development of the AFNWC's various models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines. This effort shall require engineering, configuration management, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, and maintaining various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tool's hardware and software baselines. This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, and fielding approved changes to the various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform or support studies and analyses with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) as defined in PWS Para 3.5.1-3.5.5. These studies will analyze the lifecycle of various weapons systems, the sustainment of the weapon stockpile, projected effectiveness of weapons, and the development and testing of weapon effects for chemical and biological threats in various environments. These studies will require designing, developing, and adapting mathematical, statistical, econometric, and other analytical methods and techniques for various weapon systems and technologies. The Contractor shall document findings and recommendations in briefings and/or final reports. The Contractor shall propose Modeling, Simulations and Analysis (MS&amp;A) techniques for each study and receive concurrence before techniques are employed.</p>
<p>8. Foreign-owned firms are advised they are precluded from submitting a SOC, and no prime contractor may have a subcontractor who is foreign-owned. These firms are advised to direct questions to the Contracting Points of Contact listed below. These positions require employees to be United States Citizens with the capability to obtain and maintain a minimum Top Secret clearance.</p>
<p>Foreign Citizen Performance Restrictions (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This requirement is "export-controlled." The information and materials provided pursuant to, or resulting from, this requirement are restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 - 774, which control the export of sensitive technical data. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a US Person, as defined by 22 C.F.R &sect; 120.15 or if offeror is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as US Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award, and no prime contractor may have a subcontractor who is a foreigner. Foreign Citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.</p>
<p>9. Technology developed under this requirement may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information, and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's PWS. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.</p>
<p>10. Request for Statement of Capability (SOC):</p>
<p>The SOC shall contain the following information: (1) Demonstrate ability to respond to all mission areas; (2) Include a notional plan to assure the availability of an adequate number of qualified and trained personnel to perform the continuous mission requirements; (3) Demonstrate how classified work at the Top Secret level would be accomplished to design, test, document, and field approved changes to the various spreadsheet models, simulations, statistical models, optimizations, and decision analysis tools' hardware and software baselines.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit, to the Contract Specialist listed below, an UNCLASSIFIED response that includes detailed information demonstrating their capabilities. SOCs may be emailed to the Contracting Points of Contact listed below by the response date identified in Paragraph 12. The SOC is limited to 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font. NOTE: If there is a resulting contract, it will be made only to offeror(s) who can perform the work within the AFNWC facility and have sufficient Top Secret cleared personnel with current qualifications available at the time of contract award. All contractor employees shall maintain, at a minimum, a Top Secret, level clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI), and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Also, access to classified Air Force and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) databases will be required at the Top Secret Level.</p>
<p>Firms responding should include their DUNS number and cage code. Firms should include if they are a GSA Schedule holder and under what Schedule and Special Item Number(s) (SINs) they would propose potential work. The government anticipates using NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services; Size Standard: $15M.</p>
<p>11. This sources sought synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Contracting Directorate, Kirtland AFB NM 87117. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are NOT considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be notified individually of the results of any Government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the SOCs received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business concern (e.g., HUBZone; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned; Veteran Owned; Small Disadvantaged 8(a); Historically Black College or University; and/or Woman-Owned). Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business; HUBZone; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned; Veteran Owned; Small Disadvantaged 8(a); Historically Black College or University; and/or Woman-Owned. Do not summit an SOC if you do not intend to be a prime or lead. Potential offerors should refer questions to the Contracting Points of Contact listed below. Submit SOCs no later than 4pm MST on 04 December 2014.<br />12. Contracting Points of Contact (POCs):</p>
<p>AFNWC/PZID Contracting Officer: Maxine Gallegos, maxine.gallegos@us.af.mil, (505) 853-1152<br />AFNWC/PZID Contracting Officer: Melissa Garmoe, melissa.garmoe@us.af.mil, (505) 853-1977<br />AFNWC/PZID Contract Specialist: Jennifer Wilterdink, jennifer.wilterdink@us.af.mil, (505) 846-5705</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Responses to this section do not have a page limit and should be separated from the SOCs. NOTE: Answers to the below will be used to develop the government's acquisition strategy and will not be shared with any outside sources.<br />1. Based on the DRAFT PWS, do you concur that NAICS Code 541330 is the most appropriate code for this requirement? If not, what is your recommendation? Please provide your rationale for the recommendation provided.<br />2. Based on the type of work identified in the PWS what type of contract do you believe best fits the work structure, for example: Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, etc.? Please provide your rationale for the recommendation provided. <br />3. Based on the type of work identified in the PWS, are you aware of existing contracts that may be able to support this requirement? If so, please identify the contract number, the agency under which the contract was awarded, and a government point of contract (preferably the contracting officer).<br />4. The government believes this requirement does not fit the definition of a commercial acquisition as defined in FAR 2.101, Commercial Item, and will therefore proceed with a non-commercial process. If you believe otherwise, please provide your rationale.</p>
<p>5. The government believes that a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract may be the best type of contract for this requirement, but has not made that final determination. If you have experience with a better type, please provide your recommendation and rationale.</p>

This is a Sources Sought Notice and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Any information provided to the Government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on an unrestricted basis. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only.
<p>The&nbsp;associated NAICS code 334111&nbsp;size standard is 1,000 employees. However the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name but which proposes to furnish an item which it does not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br /><br />The evaluation factors for contract award will be (i) PRICE, (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE, (iii) DELIVERY SCHEDULE, and (iv) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY (consisting of product performance characteristics, warranty, integration/installation capability, and technical support).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br /><br />The turn-key high performance computing assembly to be delivered and installed by the contract awardee is a complete computer cluster. The parts items and required performance characteristics detailed in Attachment 1 represent a technical solution that is known to fulfill the Government's requirement. Although the list of materials is based on Rittal and Hewlett-Packard products, offerors will be able to propose "brand name or equal" products (reference FAR 52.211-6). Proposals which include alternatives to the products identified in the description must be accompanied by technical documentation in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate compliance with the performance characteristics of this known solution.&nbsp; The required performance characteristics reflect the minimum salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that reflect the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs.</p>
<p>RESPONSE PROCEDURES <br /><br />Prime contractors who are 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, EDWOSB, SDVOSB, or SB concerns and who intend to submit a proposal for this notice MUST submit the following by 3:00 p.m. EST,&nbsp;6 November 2014:</p>
<p>(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a proposal for this notice as a Prime Contractor and manufacturer;</p>
<p>(2) dated letter or certification from the appropriate competent jurisdiction that evidences 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or SDVOSB participation and/or certification such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov.);</p>

Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one (1) base period of performance (one year, from 1 January 2015 through 31 December 2015) and may include up to four (4) optional periods of performance (each one year in duration, following the Federal Fiscal Year Calendar, and running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance). There is no guarantee that any optional periods of performance may be exercised. The NAICS code for this requirement is 488991, Packing and Crating Services.

The contractor is encouraged and expected to use innovative approaches to effectively and efficiently accomplish the requirements of this PWS in a timely manner and in a way that fosters pride and ownership in the work performed.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the PWS, the Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determination and the Past and Present Performance Questionnaire, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored.

<p>All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on SAM registration can be obtained at the following web site: http://www.sam.gov.</p>

The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award, the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (NOV 2012), the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory S. Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, facsimile number (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>During the Preproposal Conference held last week, the Government realized that the technology portion of the solicitation was not sufficiently described for perspective offerors to know exactly what to propose. Therefore the Government has cancelled the National Air Attack Platform solicitation (AG-024B-S-14-9013). As a result, the technology portion will be down scoped and one line item will be removed and moved to a standalone solicitation in support of the Aerial Firefighting Use and Effectiveness (AFUE) mission. The remaining three items will be reissued under solicitation number AG-024B-S-15-9010 at some point in the next few months.
<p>Thank you to everyone who provided questions and comments on both draft solicitations. The Government appreciates your commitment to this project and looks forward to working with you in the near future.<br /><br />Please refer your questions to Jeff McGinley at 208-387-5350.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION/SCOPE/OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of this acquisition is to determine if there are firms in the marketplace who design, construct, own, operate, and maintain electric vehicle charging stations on federal property. The vehicles to be charged are non-Governmental vehicles. The charging stations would interconnect with the NIST electric grid and the contractor would be assessed power consumption for each kilowatt consumed by the charging stations.</p>
<p>NIST is NOT subsidizing the cost of electricity to be used by the contractor and the motorist charging his/her vehicle. Contractor would be responsible for collecting all funds from motorists who consumes electricity from the charging stations. For the basis of this sources sought,&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the NIST electric rate is .11 per kilowatt hour, which includes demand charges.&nbsp;<br /></span></strong><br />The two locations being considered are Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO campuses. The Agency seeks qualified, experienced firms interested in this activity.<br />Approximately 3,000 people daily work/visit NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. Parking lots are dispersed across the campus for each facility. In Boulder, CO approximately 1,000 people daily work/visit the campus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIST operates a commercial off the shelf power monitoring system. The product was sold by Eaton Electric and is named POWERNET</span></strong>. Any contractor would be required to provide (furnish and install) POWERNET current transformers and meters to communicate and trend kilowatt hour consumption data into the NIST power monitoring system.</p>
<p>These meters and current transformers would be used by NIST to determine the electric consumption used by the charging stations. The contractor would then reimburse the Government for the consumed electricity deemed used by the POWERNET meters.</p>

<p>(2) How many electric vehicles or other business issues that would make an installation attractive for firms in the marketplace</p>
<p>(3) Furnish a data sheet on the proposed charging station that would be used along with any external communication requirements. Please identify on the data sheet the power requirements for the charging station (volts, phases, and amperes)</p>
<p>(4) Type/Size of company, NAICS code, and Social Economic status, as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).</p>
<p>(5) All offerors must register on the CCR located at http://www.sam.gov, additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov.</p>
<p>(6) Statement of Bonding Capacity <br />The synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<p>DESCRIPTION/SCOPE/OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of this acquisition is to determine if there are firms in the marketplace who design, construct, own, operate, and maintain electric vehicle charging stations on federal property. The vehicles to be charged are non-Governmental vehicles. The charging stations would interconnect with the NIST electric grid and the contractor would be assessed power consumption for each kilowatt consumed by the charging stations.</p>
<p>NIST is NOT subsidizing the cost of electricity to be used by the contractor and the motorist charging his/her vehicle. Contractor would be responsible for collecting all funds from motorists who consumes electricity from the charging stations. For the basis of this sources sought,&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the NIST electric rate is .11 per kilowatt hour, which includes demand charges.&nbsp;<br /></span></strong><br />The two locations being considered are Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO campuses. The Agency seeks qualified, experienced firms interested in this activity.<br />Approximately 3,000 people daily work/visit NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. Parking lots are dispersed across the campus for each facility. In Boulder, CO approximately 1,000 people daily work/visit the campus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIST operates a commercial off the shelf power monitoring system. The product was sold by Eaton Electric and is named POWERNET</span></strong>. Any contractor would be required to provide (furnish and install) POWERNET current transformers and meters to communicate and trend kilowatt hour consumption data into the NIST power monitoring system.</p>
<p>These meters and current transformers would be used by NIST to determine the electric consumption used by the charging stations. The contractor would then reimburse the Government for the consumed electricity deemed used by the POWERNET meters.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>A. INTRODUCTION: Technical Experimentation (TE) Collaboration</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals, and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to provide participants with the opportunity to gain Special Operations Forces (SOF) insight/perspective on participant technologies.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions for future SOF capabilities.</p>
<p>This RFI is for TE 15-2:<br />&#61607; Date: 02 through 06 February 2015<br />&bull; Theme: Signature Management and other selected technology areas<br />&bull; Location: Camp Blanding, Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG), FL</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Technology experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies.</p>
<p>2. The deadline for nomination package(s) is 1 December 2014 at 12:00 Noon EST. After review of the TE nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their technologies at the USSOCOM sponsored TE event. Experiments will be conducted from 02 through 06 February 2014, at Camp Blanding, FLARNG, FL, and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in relevant technologies. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be between a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 and 6. Proposed experiments may be between a half day and two days in duration and may be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. There is no intention on the part of USSOCOM to purchase or procure equipment based solely on participation in TE.</p>
<p>3. Experimentation Focus: The primary intent of this event is to highlight technologies that support Comprehensive Signature Management. This is multispectral signature reduction for the individual soldier and his equipment including materials or technologies that reduce the likelihood of detection/identification/targeting of SOF operators and vehicles.</p>
<p>**** Amended 4 November 2014 - RFI TE 15-2.&nbsp; SEE PACKAGE #1 WITH RFI 15-2, rev 4 November 2014&nbsp;FOR COMOPLETE RFI WITH SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY AREAS SELECTED FOR THIS TE EVENT and SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS. ####</p>
