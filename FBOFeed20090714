<DESC><p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration - Owego, 1801 State Rt. 17C, Owego, NY 13827-3998 (607) 751-3119 based on the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1. The IDIQ contract would have an ordering period of 5 years with an anticipated maximum dollar amount of $4.8M.</p>
<p>Tasks under this IDIQ contract may include enhancements and on-call maintenance support of the A-10C Operational Facility (OPFAC). It is anticipated the first task order will be to incorporate an Improved Data Modem (IDM) and ARC-210 radio capability into the A-10C OPFAC built by Lockheed Martin Systems Integration at their Owego, NY plant under Department of the Air Force contract number FA8635-07-D-6000-0006, to be delivered to Eglin's Datalinks Test Facility (DTF) in July 2009. This IDM and ARC-210 enhancement shall consist primarily of hardware changes to the existing Lockheed A-10C OPFAC and will give the A-10C OPFAC the ability to transmit and receive Variable Message Format (VMF), an entirely new waveform which enhances the close air support role of the A-10C aircraft. This enhancement is critical to the development and testing of on-going programs that directly affect the warfighter and is critical to enabling the A-10C OPFAC to mirror the actual A-10C aircraft. This enhancement will better support joint datalink and interoperability testing.</p>
<p>Additional taskings may include software/hardware upgrades that would affect the Eglin DTF A-10C OPFAC datalink testing capability, to include OFP and Suite updates. In addition, the government may require the contractor to physically install any software or hardware upgrades at the Eglin DTF that are deemed necessary to maintain the most current OPFAC configuration and datalink testing capability.</p>

<DESC>The SEWS support requires contractors to propose and implement SEWS architectural solutions within three different COCOMs (EUCOM, CENTCOM and PACOM), that pertain to any and all SEWS related issues for US and foreign partner sites as well as provide hardware, software and network support services to existing SEWS facilities and Foreign Military Sales customers.  Activities include, but not limited to, initial site surveys, final design reviews, installation, sustainment, and training of SEWS.  The SEWS program is a mission-critical early warning system that includes software applications, databases, servers, client workstations, and wide area networks hosted on an open architecture.    The tasks required include engineering and administrative support of the SEWS program in the areas of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case development, export control and compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, planning, equipment acquisition, configuration management,!  equipment installation, maintenance and sustainment, training (including 24/7 help desk and system monitoring), Research/Development (R&D) initiatives, and software development and modification.  SEWS is designed to provide and display US Missile Event Information (MEI) to SEWS foreign partners and Theater Combatant Commanders (COCOMs).  SEWS is a US-only project that supports early warning for foreign partners by distributing data from existing US missile warning systems.  The SEWS focus is on timeliness and the use of existing missile event feeds and distributing the data to partner nations, consistent with US foreign policy.

<DESC>The 554 ELSG/PNK is conducting market research to determine the optimum acquisition strategy for the procurement of maintenance srevices to overhaul and refurbish automated filing system carousels.
This project supports the refurbishment of "NoWalk" Horizontal Carousel filing systems located in Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center/DPIRO.  This section scans all Air Force civilian personnel records for the Official Personnel File (OPF) management program.  The OPFs, after scanning, are stored in the Horizontal Carousels for storage and retrieval. The first No-Walk Horizontal Carousels were installed in the OPF section in 1996 and has not received major hardware overhaul and refurbishment to date. 
Refurbishment of the equipment is required due to building settlement which has caused the tracks to shift and become unlevel. As the carousels shift, the bins' rollers pop off, causing the tracks to bend and move due to the alignment and weight of the equipment. A comphrehensive overhaul and refurbishment is required to prevent a complete breakdown of ally systems and components.

<DESC>The Stratton VA Medical Center, located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany, NY, is soliciting for a contract for Architect/Engineer (A/E) services.  This procurement will be conducted following the procedures outlined in FAR 36.6, and specifically 36.602-5 for shortened selection procedures.  This means that interested firms are to submit a standard form 330 (available via the GSA forms library at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF) in hard or electronic copy for shortlist evaluation based on the standard VA Construction and Facilities Management scoresheet (blank copies are available upon request for reference purposes).  Selection will be made by the chairperson of the selection board based entirely on these initial submissions and oral presentations will NOT be conducted.The intent of the contract design shall be to perform investigative analysis and design and produce working drawings and specifications necessary for the award of a construction contract to repair the linen chutes in all wings of the Stratton VA Medical Center, building 1.  All seams and welds in the linen chute should be repaired to ensure there are no impediments to laundry bags from reaching the sub-basement from each of the four wings, which may cause potential damage to the bags and their contents.  The design will encompass details to repair and/or replace any damaged sections of the chutes, chute doors, switches, electric locks, wiring and indicator lights.  The linen safety interlock system will be restored and these interlocks will be tamper proof and installed at each floor for each linen chute.  All linen chutes will be brought to applicable fire and safety codes, with a design for through-roof ventilation for each of the four linen chutes.  New work will be designed in accordance with VA and NFPA guidelines.In evaluating offers received for past performance and technical capability, specific weight will be given to work of a similar scope and proposed team members with specific background experience in this type of boiler engineering work.There will be an enforced geographic restriction on eligible offerors of 60 miles from the Stratton VA due to the necessity for frequent site visits during both design and construction.The VA has not specified a socio-economic set-aside for this project, but is willing to consider one based on a cascading system of preference.  Per the Brooks Act, three firms deemed technically acceptable must be evaluated in order to proceed towards award, and as such three acceptable offers from one socio-economic category MUST be received to consider a set-aside.  Technically acceptable shall be defined as a rating of 60 or higher out of 146 possible points.  The order of preference for socio-economic set-asides as is follows:1.	Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business2.	Veteran-Owned Small Business3.	HUBZONE Business4.	8a/Woman-Owned5.	Large Business (unrestricted/no set-aside).As this procurement falls under the small business competitiveness demonstration program, a set-aside for general small business will not be considered.The cost of construction for the resulting construction project is estimated to be valued at $550,000.

<DESC>Synopsis: Follow on contract BOFRP Computer Software Programming
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Central Region, intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to Research Management Consultant Inc.(RMCI), 651 Corporate Circle STE 123, Golden, CO for computer programming services in association with the Branch of Forest Resources Planning Office (BOFRP). The reference no. BOFRP001  will be awarded as a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The procurement services of completely overhauling, testing, debugging, making operational, customizing and enhancing the Continuous Forest Inventory System from any other source will be a substantial delay and duplication of training, educating, production, service and cost in working with and learning the unique needs of BOFRP. Any savings gained through competing would unlikely be recovered through award to the competed vendor.	Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after the date of publication of  this synopsis will be considered in the determination by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No formal solicitation shall be issued.

<DESC><p>Description
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contemplates award of a fixed price contract for Design/Build of CDC Building 107 &amp; 108, two multi-story office buildings and their associated parking decks at the Chamblee Campus, 4770 Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA. 30341. The contract award shall be in accordance with a Two Phase Design Build Selection Procedure, as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.3. The Government estimates total cost of the design and construction to be between $200M - $300M. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned is 236220. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a Federal contract. This procurement is unrestricted.</p>
<p>The Building 107 project (B.107) consists of the design and construction of a new 294,800 gross square feet (GSF) office building, site utilities and a 729 car parking deck. A service drive and hardscape treatment to provide pedestrian and emergency vehicle access is included in the project in accordance with the Chamblee Campus Master Plan. The project includes approximately 275 linear feet (LF) of utility services containing steam, water, voice/data, and other utilities, which will connect with the existing campus utility tunnel system.

<p>PHASE II</p>
<p>During Phase II, a Solicitation will be issued to each prospective offeror within the competitive range also referred to as the short list. Offerors selected to participate in Phase II competition for award of a contract will be notified in writing. Each prospective offeror will be given a copy of the Building 107 &amp; 108 Project Development Studies (PDS) and a tour of the site prior to their interview. Each prospective offeror will also be asked to submit a price and technical proposal for design-build services for the Building 107 &amp; 108 project. The following criteria represent the factors which will be used by CDC's Source Selection Panel for the source selection process:</p>

The proposals will be scored according to the technical evaluation factors and standards outlined in the RFP. The technical proposals will be reviewed by the SSP prior to the SSA's review. After the technical evaluation has been completed, the contract may be awarded on the basis of the initial proposals. However, if the Contracting Officer determines discussions are necessary, offerors will be advised in accordance with FAR 15.306(d)(3) and FAR 15.307, of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses and will be given an opportunity to clarify and submit a final proposal.

<DESC>This is the presolicitation notice for the 8(a) STARS II Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). The actual solicitation will be posted here in approximately two weeks.  

8(a) STARS II Request for Proposals

The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Integrated Technology Services (ITS), Small Business (SB) Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) Center (the Center) is pleased to announce the request for proposals (RFP) for the 8(a) Streamlined Technology Acquisition Resources for Services (STARS) II GWAC. 8(a) STARS II, a/k/a STARS II. By law, a GWAC is an information technology (IT) contract and STARS II concentrates on IT services and IT services-based solutions.  The STARS II GWAC is expected to build upon the achievements of its predecessor, 8(a) STARS (www.gsa.gov/8astars), and will incorporate best practices and lessons learned from the synergistic partnership with stakeholders. 

**NOTE: All copies/references to the 8(a) STARS II DRAFT RFP, posted under Special Notice 2009MJC00002, should be disregarded.

The official RFP will only be available on FedBizOpps, a/k/a FBO (www.fbo.gov), approximately two weeks following this presolicitation notice. The RFP is set-aside exclusively for qualifying certified 8(a) small business concerns as the prime contractors per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.8, and the Small Business Administrations (SBA) rules for the 8(a) Business Development Program (www.sba.gov). The Center encourages interested parties to be familiar with the SBA 8(a) programs regulatory framework. Questions regarding the 8(a) program should be directed to the SBA.

STARS II will promote the use of performance-based contracting and will accommodate task orders with the following terms: fixed-price (FP) (all in FAR 16.2), time-and-materials (T&M) (per FAR 16.6), and labor-hour (LH) (per FAR 16.6).  8(a) STARS II will also allow requiring activities to choose among the incentive features found in FAR 16.4 that are tied to FP, T&M and LH terms.  The contract term includes a five-year base period with one five-year option.  

There are no projects assigned for STARS II. It is being established as an option for agencies to embrace in meeting their 8(a) and small business procurement preference goals.  Agencies will make their own decisions on the benefits of using this GWAC for IT requirements.  Warranted Contracting Officers wanting to use STARS II directly may do so. They are first required to complete delegation of procurement authority (DPA) training to effectively use the vehicle, whereupon they will be eligible for a DPA.

The STARS II scope consists of two constellations/levels, each comprised of four independent Functional Areas (FAs). The levels are differentiated by certain qualification requirements identified in the RFP. Although the single North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code most closely tied to the entire GWAC is 541512, each FA is assigned its own NAICS code (see the RFP) having an associated size standard.  

The STARS II contract ceiling value is $10 billion (all references to dollars or $ are in U.S. currency), to be drawn down commensurate with the value of orders placed, with no fixed allocation to either constellation or FA or to any individual contract.    

The Center has established a STARS II website (www.gsa.gov/8astars2) that has some collateral material regarding STARS II on it, but only FBO will host the official solicitation.  There will be no other source of official information about the 8(a) STARS II solicitation beyond that in the written RFP posted on FBO.  

FBO has an interested parties notification feature and affords businesses the opportunity to be listed as interested in STARS II. Please note that the Center is not responsible for those features, and does not guarantee them. They are available as is. Interested parties are instructed to personally and directly refer to FBO frequently to stay up to date and not to rely upon courtesy notification services. 

The Center prefers all STARS II inquires be directed to the STARS II email address (s2@gsa.gov), having established a response team to address inquires sent there.  Inquiries directed elsewhere regarding STARS II may go unanswered.  Using the STARS II email address (s2@gsa.gov) as the point of contact will provide continuity and consistency for everyone.  DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF INQUIRIES EXPECTED, TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Please read and reread the RFP before asking questions as it is designed to be clear and complete.

Thank you for your interest in 8(a) STARS II.

<DESC>Description of Work- This solicitation and any resultant contract is a stewardship project in accordance with Section 323 of Public Law 108-7 (16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, as revised February 28, 2003 to reflect sec. 323 of J.J. Res. 2 as enrolled), the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, amending Public Law 105-277, sec. 347.  This is a request for proposals Service acquisition that has been tailored to fit the Governments method of trading goods for services.  The purpose of the proposed Sourgrass Fuel Reduction and Vegetation Management Project is to reduce forest surface and ladder fuel profiles and to lower timber stand densities on about 1,401 acres of public land on the Calaveras Ranger District.  About 37 acres of the project area are within the WUI zone for the community of Dorrington.  These treatments are designed to reduce the size and severity of future wildfires, reduce the risk of insect/pathogen drought-related mortality and promote growth and vigor in residual trees, optimize visual quality, improve watershed conditions, and restore or enhance habitat for riparian and aquatic species.  

The project will remove approximately 10,494 ccf of merchantable timber and 1,307 ccf of biomass on about 1,102 acres.  Stands will be thinned using various prescriptions for removing merchantable timber between 10 and 30dbh (with the exception of hazard trees, right-of-way trees, etc. which may be greater than 30dbh), biomass material between 4 and 10dbh, and shredding, masticating or burning material that is between 1 and 4dbh.  In addition, about 238 acres would receive understory burning with no thinning prescription.

Project Location: 

The project is located approximately 8 miles northeast of Arnold on National Forest System lands within the Calaveras Ranger District.  Access is primarily off of State Highway 4.  Much of the project area is surrounded by lands owned by Sierra Pacific Industries and other private ownership.  Nearby residential subdivisions include Dorrington, Camp Connell, and Cottage Springs.

The legal description for the Sourgrass Fuel Reduction and Vegetation Management Project is: T5N R15E Section 1, T5N R16E Sections 4-6, T6N R15E Section 24, T6N R16E Sections 19-21 & 29-33

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).  

This Pre-Solicitation Notice is hereby issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This project is subject to the availability of funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.

Develop and Deliver a Detailed Design for the Plumbing System for the Thermal Shield Cooling System, Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD.

Description of Services
The NIST Reactor (NBSR) is equipped with a thermal shield.  This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight.  Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair. 

Work required under this task order will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system.  

The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

Work under this task order is follow-on work to a task order awarded competitively in July of 2008 and completed in October 2008.  Work under that task order developed a concept design to upgrade the thermal shield cooling system.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, anticipates award of a service contract that will cover FY10 - FY11 service requirements related to US Navy submarine storage batteries.  This will be a sole source procurement to EnerSys Technology, Warrensburg, MO based on FAR 6.302-1, only one source capable of meeting the Government's requirements.  A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Requirements covered will be field and maintenance services for EnerSys main storage batteries on submarines that are in service (i.e., not under construction).  The Navy is in the process of transitioning from the flooded lead acid batteries to Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA batteries); installation of batteries are beginning to shift away from flooded lead acid to VRLA batteries.  As part of the field services effort the contractor is required to make routine visits at least once a year to each submarine as authorized by the Government, and make emergency visits as authorized.  The maintenance portion of the effort requires the contractor to have a complete maintenance program for all batteries on submarines.  Requirements specific to battery type require assistance in the planning, installation, testing, checkout, adjustment, disassembly and repair of submarine battery cells; and performance of on-the-job instruction and training of Navy personnel (military and/or civilian).  It is estimated that 2.0 man-years per year will be necessary to complete the requirements.  The applicable NAICS classification is 541330.  A Confidential Security Clearance is required.  Interested parties may submit inquiries or request a copy of the solicitation by sending an email to lorna.tribby@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This solicitation number N68836-09-R-0054 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This requirement is a total small business set aside and the applicable NAIC is 333415 with a standard size of 750 employees. FISC Jacksonville anticipates award of a firm-fixed price contract for the following:
SummaryThe Training Support Department of the Naval Construction Training Center at Gulfport, MS requires twelve (12) automotive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) simulator / trainers (henceforth referred to as "trainers").  Six (6) trainers must be delivered to Gulfport not later than 21 September 2009 and six (6) must be delivered to Port Hueneme not later than 16 December 2009.  Delivery must include initial installation, on site start-up and testing, and basic instruction on operation and maintenance of the trainers.BackgroundNaval Construction Training Centers at Port Hueneme, CA and Gulfport, MS will offer a revised advanced training course for Navy Construction Mechanics.  The new course will feature advanced skills training in troubleshooting and repair of a range of automotive systems including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The automotive trainers requested herein will be used by our instructors in a mechanic shop-type training environment to provide hands-on training in HVAC theory, operation, mechanics, and troubleshooting to Navy Construction Mechanics.The three priorities for the design and construction of these trainers are as follows:1.	Safety - The Trainers must have comprehensive safety features ensuring safest operation and shutdown.  Desire maximum use of transparent materials in the construction of the trainers to facilitate quality training; however, all transparent components must be protected by secondary, transparent enclosures.2.	Training Effectiveness - HVAC operation must be realistic and must maximize the use of transparent materials to facilitate the highest quality training.  Construction Mechanics trained on this equipment will deploy as senior mechanics in overseas motor-pools supporting war-time and contingency operations.3.	Durability - The Trainers must be fully functional upon delivery and continue to work with minimal corrective maintenance for the life of the equipment.Due to strict time constraints to deliver this mission-essential training, there must be little to no delay in bringing the trainers to fully operational status following delivery.  Thus the Navy requires these trainers to be new (not refurbished) with, to the greatest extent possible, Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) parts.Features / Capacities1.	Trainers will replicate, to the nearest extent possible, standard automotive dash boards / instrumentation panels.2.	Trainers will accept single-phase 220V power.3.	Trainers will have standard automotive R-134A HVAC-system functionality to include, but not limited to, the following:a.	Air conditioning (max, normal, bi-level);b.	Economy (normal ventilation and heater modes); andc.	Defrost.4.	Trainers will have standard automotive R-134A HVAC-system sub-systems and components.  Components will be OEM, except those parts needed to be modified / fabricated in support of training functions (e.g. transparent components described below).5.	Trainers will incorporate fully-functional, self-contained, electrical fan systems for the condenser when the A/C portion of the trainer is in operation.6.	Trainers will have color-coded flanges and header plates:  Blue for suction and red for discharge.7.	To the maximum extent possible, components will be fabricated from transparent materials in order to facilitate training.  All transparent components must be protected by secondary, transparent enclosures.  At a minimum, the following components / sub-systems shall be transparent:a.	Accumulator and orifice tube;b.	Suction and discharge hoses; andc.	Heater hoses.8.	Transparent components must have easily accessible points for the exposure of UVA light ("black-light") in order to see flow of refrigerant through the system and to detect leaks in conjunction with the use of leak-test dye.  It is preferable, but not necessary, that a UVA lighting system be incorporated into the design of the trainer.9.	Trainers will be mounted on sturdy / durable frames with large lockable casters (wheels) to facilitate easy movement over various shop floor surfaces to include steel diamond decking.10.	Frames will incorporate a water catch / run-off system that will drain system leakage and condensation from the evaporator, preventing run-off from dripping on the trainer or the floor.11.	Design must incorporate accessible disconnect points between large components and high-wear items for ease of replacing worn or damaged components.12.	Components meeting the following minimum criteria will be protected by passive guards and / or insulation and will be clearly marked with CAUTION / WARNING / DANGER placards:a.	Rotating fans, belts, and pulleys;b.	Live electrical components; andc.	Hot surfaces.13.	Trainers will also be labeled in obvious / applicable locations to convey the need for personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, gloves, etc.) and to indicate refrigerant type and system capacities.14.	At a minimum, each trainer will include five (5) replacement accumulator desiccant bags and five (5) seal kits, for a total of thirty (30) each to Gulfport and Port Hueneme.Delivery InformationTrainers will be shipped in accordance with MIL-STD-129 (Military Marking for Shipment and Storage.  Deliver six (6) trainers to Gulfport no later than 21 September 2009 and six (6) to Port Hueneme no later than 16 December 2009.

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, in descending order of importance: 1.	Ability to meet required delivery dates, 2.	Technical capability, 3.	Price,4.	Past performance, 
In their proposals offerors shall include reference information as indicated in the Contractor Performance Data Sheet.  Offerors shall provide information on 3 previous Government contracts whose effort was relevant to the effort required by this solicitation; the contracts provided shall have been performed within the last 3 years. The Government may evaluate an offeror's past performance on less than the maximum possible number of references. If the offeror has not had 3 Government contracts within the last 3 years, information on relevant subcontracts and/or commercial contracts may be submitted instead (the information must be clear whether the work by the offeror was done as a prime contractor or a subcontractor). Offerors who describe similar contracts and subcontracts shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the similarity of the contracts to the requirements of the RFP. For each of the three contracts provided as a reference, the offeror shall provide all of the information specified.The Government may verify past performance information. The Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires, telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and DOD Past Performance Automated Information System (DODP AIS). The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.  The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure the problems it finds in the information provided by the offeror. The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the offeror.Offerors with past performance data will be evaluated.  However, those offerors with no past performance data will neither be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Therefore, offerors will receive a rating of acceptable for acceptable past performance as defined it Figure 1-1, unacceptable for poor past performance as defined it Figure 1-1, and a neutral rating for no relevant past performance.Figure 1-1: Past Performance RatingsAcceptable Past Performance:  The offeror's performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) met or exceeded contractual requirements.  Performance over completed contracts was consistently of adequate or better quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offeror's past performance record leads to an expectation of successful performance.    Unacceptable Past Performance:  The offeror's performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery did not occur with the period of performance.  The assessed prior performance reflected serious problem(s) for which the offeror either failed to identify or implement corrective actions or for which corrective actions, implemented, or proposed to be implemented, were, or are expected to be, mostly ineffective.  Performance over completed contracts was consistently of poor quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offeror's past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved or that it can occur only with greatly increased levels of Government management and oversight.  Neutral: This rating shall only be used if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.				Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

<CONTACT>Jerry L Riles, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-767-0667, Email jerry.riles@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. NRL will negotiate with Tobii Technology Incorporated, 510 N. Washington St., Suite 200, Falls Church, VA 22046, for Tobii T120 and X60 eye-tracking hardware system and software and warranty.  The system must be able to track where operators are looking without being in contact with the operator.  Calibration of the person must be quick, efficient, and accurate.  Spatial resolution must be less than or equal to .2 degrees of visual angle; accuracy must be less than .5 degree of visual angle.  Additionally, the system must be able to track many different ethnicities with a full range of glasses and contacts.  The eye-tracker must also be able to track at a minimum of 60Hz.  The eye-tracker must be able to allow freedom of head movement in a box a minimum of 30 x 20 x 30 cm at a range of 60-80cm. The operator must be able to move away from the eye-tracker (perhaps for an extended period), and return without a new calibration period.  Because there are many situations where Navy operators get up and move around, the ability to move away from the eye-tracker and come back without recalibration is absolutely critical.  This also requires that the eye-tracker be non-tethered and not a head-mounted system (head-mounted systems do not allow much freedom of head-movement and tethered versions not only require a longer time to reacquire since the tether increases time but also allow limited mobility).  The use of fiducials is unacceptable because they are an obvious sign of who is being tracked.  The software development kit (SDK) must work with both MS visual basic and MS visual C++.  Both the T120 and X60 from Tobii have a spatial accuracy of .5 degrees and a resolution of .2 degrees.  They allow freedom of head-movements while tracking to be 30x22x30cm at a distance of 70cm.  The T120 tracks at 120Hz and the T60 tracks at 60Hz, both within specifications. It allows tracking with most/all ethnicities and eye-colors, and is able to track with all forms of glasses and contacts.  Initial calibration is fast and accurate and does not require a head-mounted display.  Finally, and critically, the Tobii eye-trackers allow an operator to leave the eye-tracker and return an extended period later without a new calibration period.  Delivery will be required within 180 ays of contract award. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC><p>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to negotiate on other than full and open competitive basis with both Teledyne Imaging Systems (TIS) and Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) for the award of two separate contracts. Under both prospective contracts, the contractors shall provide Hybrid Silicon CMOS visible imaging sensor chip assemblies that are sensitive over the 450 - 900 nm spectral band. The SCAs must operate at a temperature of 193K with a mean dark current of less than 1 electron/pixel-sec. At this temperature the SCAs must achieve average quantum efficiencies of greater than 80% over the 700-900 nm spectral band. The SCAs will be used for astrometric measurements and therefore fill factors of greater than 95% with highly uniform response are required. The SCAs must also have the ability to have small groups of pixels read at frame rates as high as 5 Hz without interfering with the operation of the remainder of the array, which may be required to operate at frame rates as low as 0.002 Hz. The capabilities of the two contractors rely on the use of fabrication processes proprietary to each vendor. Each has its own proprietary devise designs, semiconductor processing techniques, and bump bond hybridization processes unique to the small pixel size are employed in the fabrication of these assemblies. The fact that engineering grade, prototype and flight quality SCAs must be delivered within 12 months of contract award, a date that is driven by a system launch schedule precludes the development of other sources. The development of the technology for these imaging chips has been funded in large part by another government agency to develop the capability required by the JMAPS program. To achieve delivery within budget and schedule allowances the government requires continuity of the prior development efforts. At least $10M has been invested by the government at each of the suppliers over the past 4 years. A similar funding level and time would be required to develop additional sources, with no guarantee that the vendor would be successful. The time frame alone makes this an untenable approach. There are strict requirements for the delivery dates stated herein, and any delay would have a severe cost impact on the rest of the program, which is currently projected to cost ~$150M. Even a one year delay in the program would cost ~$15M and likely put the entire mission in jeopardy of being canceled.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at the following website:</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for a contractor to furnish all plant, labor, equipment and materials and perform all work for rehabilitating the upstream miter gate at Eisenhower Lock in Massena, New York.  This project will include work to replace the embedded wall quoin assemblies, the quoin and miter contact blocks, the pintles and pintle bushings, the diagonals and the rubber seals.  To accomplish these tasks will require that each gate leaf, which is approximately 
45 ft. wide by 45 ft. high and each weighing approximately 150 tons, be lifted and moved out of the way, concrete be removed and replaced, steel be cut and welded and molten zinc be placed behind the contact blocks.  The final plumbness and alignment of the gate leafs is critical to their operation.  The on-site portion of the project must be completed between the 2010 and 2011 Navigation Seasons (approximately between January 1, 2011 and March 15, 2011) or the opening of the entire St. Lawrence Seaway will be delayed.
The cost range of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  There is a $15.00 US funds non-refundable fee for a CD with drawings, or $200.00 US funds non-refundable fee for hard/paper copies of drawings.

Once driftwood logs are removed from the face of the dam they are to be hauled to a designated dump site where they are to be chipped.<BR><BR>Work will consist of walking up and down large rip-rap rock on face of dam.  Trees will be pulled/lifted from the face of the dam to the bottom of the dam with minimal movement of rip rap.  Chainsaw work may be required to cut larger pieces of driftwood for ease of handling and hauling.  Any rip-rap that is moved in the process needs to be put back into its original position.  Once the trees/logs have been removed from the face of the dam the contractor will be required to haul trees to Sandpiper Recreation Area (1.1 mile) for them to be chipped.  The dump location is a flat, level, open terrain for ease of dumping and chipping.  <BR><BR>On the west side of the barrier dam between the bike trail and the dam is a small grove of trees which need to be removed.  Trees need to flush cut to the ground.  All trees in the area need to be taken out except for the Pin Oak.  Pin Oak trees will be marked by the Government with orange paint.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center East, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, NC has a requirement for 1 each portable fluid purifier.  The government intends to procure this portable fluid purifier from Pall Aeropower Corporation, 10540 Ridge Road, New Port Richey, FL 34654, cage code 18350.  The Portable Fluid Purifier is available from only one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  There are no substitutes available.  Specific characteristics of the Pall oil purification unit that limit availability to a sole source is that all adaptors fittings, filter hoses are currently used in other test stands on site for fit form and function of the item.  This purchase would eliminate manual changes, operators training, stocking more items and reconfiguring new test hookup adaptors.  NAVAIR 01-1A-17 Organizational Intermediate and Depot Maintenance Manual specifies Pall Aeropower Corporation Portable Fluid as the only source that will accomplish the above requirement.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Logistics Command (LOGCOM) is seeking a Secondary Repairable Logistics Integration Support (LIS) service to develop and manage a commercial capacity to continue Remanufacture, Overhaul, or Repair (ROR) selected SECREPS as specifically described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The goal is to provide responsive and cost effective supply chains for each National Stock Number (NSN) with increased component availability and reliability as a complement/alternative to any existing depot or Inventory Control Point (ICP) capabilities already in place.
The envisioned contract vehicle is a 5-year (including options) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a single vendor containing a fixed price for ROR of each NSN and an Over and Above contract line item for items turned in by the Government damaged or otherwise outside the standardized configuration.
The current list of items stands at approximately 700 different NSNs, and the potential IDIQ contract value is in excess of $200,000,000 over five years.  The selected contractor will be required to perform certain functions (primarily accepting equipment from the Government, and shipping and receiving) on Marine Corps installations at five Government locations in California, Georgia, North Carolina, and Okinawa Japan, however we expect that the majority of the actual ROR capability will be obtained through subcontracting.  Interested contractors must be able to provide the required services in all of these locations.  
The proposed NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541614- Size Standard is $7.0 Million.  This solicitation will be issued as a Full and Open procurement.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The 355th Contracting Squadron is conducting market research to seek providers of a Bead Blast Booth at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson AZ. NAICS is 423830 - Industrial Machinery and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers. Work will include purchase/installation of a Bead Blast Booth and installation of an enclosure to contain the booth . The contractor shall design the project to match existing buildings within an industrial maintenance area. There are two possible sites for installation. See Attachment: Site Pictures<br />The enclosure will be constructed on an existing cement foundation. The Bead Blast Booth (2 operator package) minimum requirements are:
<p>I. Plastic Media Blasting (PMB) Booth with the following minimum specifications: dimension 20W x 12H x 40L with (1) Air Wall AutoClean Dust Collection System, Breathing Air System for two operators, an Automatic Above-Ground Plastic Media Blasting Machine with a Automatic Above-Ground Full Recovery System, High Density Particle Separator system and a Compressed Air System, with Refrigerated Drier.</p>
<p>NOTE: Options to be included: Silencers, High Efficiency Particulate Arresting filter packages, specialty filter cartridges, Dust Discharge Hoppers and Dust Conveying Hoppers.</p>
<p>II. Above-Ground Plastic Media Blasting (PMB) Machine</p>
<p>PMB machine that will include as a minimum the listed standard components: Above-Ground Full Floor Media Recovery Hopper, Media Storage Hopper, Pneumatic Recovery System, Reclaim Dust Collection System, Pressure Vessel Assembly for two Operators and Smart Handle. The assembly of these Bead Blast Booth components will be done in accordance with manufactures guidelines.</p>
<p>III. Automatic Above-Ground Full Floor Recovery System</p>
<p>a. Install on the existing cement foundation an automatic full floor recovery system as requested in this proposal. The booth floor hopper area will be covered with a scalping cover and grating which can support a nominal sized tow tractor, mobile A/C unit or forklift (estimated 23,000 lb min.). <br /><br />b. Operator respiration systems need to accommodate two operators. The system will include two hard helmets with positive pressure air supply valves and capes, air filtration system with CO monitor, three (3) 50 ft. lengths of air supply hose and breathing air conditioners.</p>
<p>NOTE: A concrete ramp will be required at the opening for above-ground system. (The length of the ramp will have to decrease the incline enough to allow for equipment to be manually pushed in and out of the booth). Contractor must perform a site visit with the primary user in order to collect the relevant data for the appropriate ramp grade calculation.</p>
<p>IV. High Volume Density Particle Separator (HDPS) System.</p>
<p>This system is to be used for paint stripping of aircraft surfaces or components and must meet aircraft manufacturer and military specifications in regard to high density particle contamination (MIL-P-85891 of T.O. 1-1-8). A high density particle can be roughly defined as any particle with a specific gravity in excess of 1.65.</p>
<p>NOTE: System must be isolated from outside weather and wind to function properly.</p>
<p>V. Compressed Air System, with Refrigerated Drier</p>
<p>Install a screw drive breathable (High Efficiency Particulate Air Filter (HEPA) filter system) air compressor unit capable of supporting, breathable air system, all blasting equipment and clean up operations. The compressor will include an acoustic enclosure to reduce noise levels and dual filters consisting of a high flow moisture separator as well as a coalescent filter. Contractor must perform a site visit with the primary user in order to collect the relevant data for the calculation of the appropriate compressor size.</p>
<p><br />VI. Bead Blast Booth Enclosure: Construct an enclosure large enough to enclose/insert the Bead Blast Booth system and provide enough room to accommodate daily maintenance around the equipment as specified by manufacturer. Enclosure will have one entry way door big enough to accommodate the bead blast booth installation, equipment to be serviced and a man door with window for walk-in personnel. Holes will be drilled into the enclosure to accommodate the installation of the Bead Blast Booth and all necessary connections to support equipment, utilities (i.e. outside hopper, dust collection systems, fibertory shaker, control panel, etc.) and each penetration/component needs to be weather proof.</p>
<p>Note: Contractor will construct the Bead Blast Booth enclosure in accordance with manufacture specifications.</p>
<p>VII. SITE LOCATION:<br /><br />The location of the enclosure and Bead Blast Booth will be constructed on the existing cement located at the northwest corner of the Wash Rack's area north of building 7425 (see attached map). Install a sealant and/or a concrete curb barrieraround the exterior bottom of the enclosure/booth to help prevent any kind of water seepage into the inside of the enclosure/booth. The cement area at the site location is approximately 11" to 14" thick. Contract will need to acquire desired blue print specifications of cement area from Davis-Monthan Civil Engineering department for this project.</p>
<p>VIII. INSTALLATION, START-UP, TRAINING</p>
<p>a. Contractor is responsible for bringing the utilities needed for the Bead Blast Booth installation. Currently no 460 volt power exists at the proposed location for the bead blast booth on the northwest edge of the wash rack. There is an overhead high voltage line that is within 200 ft of the northwest edge of the wash rack that can be tapped into and a step-down transformer placed to feed the bead blast booth. However, contractor will need to verify power requirements for Davis-Monthan and get approval from the Civil Engineering Department for the appropriate site location for power supply.</p>
<p>b. Install all necessary grounding and fire protection needed for proper equipment operation and facility protection (IAW requirement NEC, NFPA and manufactures guidelines).</p>
<p>c. Pricing to include installation, start-up, training personnel and four electronic copies of the installation/operators manuals</p>
<p>d. Install/calibrate required equipment to allow operation to be with- in OSHA, NEC and NFPA (i.e. fire protection sprinkler system, explosion proof lighting, and CO2 monitor system).</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY! Any information submitted is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this request. Interested businesses should submit their written statement of interest via email to the 355th Contracting Squadron/MSCAB, Willa Farr, EMAIL: willa.farr@dm.af.mil.</p>

<p>377 CONS/LGC Operational Contracting Squadron <br />2000 Wyoming Blvd, SE <br />Bldg 20604<br />Kirtland AFB, NM 87121</p>
<p><br />Description:</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT: This is an announcement for information and planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP), Request For Quote (RFQ), or Invitation For Bid (IFB). Potential offerors should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offeror's ability to provide a system meeting the requirements below. IAW 15.201(e) Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) is seeking potential sources to provide a commercial off the shelf (COTS) system that identifies high-risk practices, procedures, conditions, and attitudes before accidents occur, and provides paths to mitigate them by synthesizing this data into a mishap reduction system called the Combined Mishap Reduction System (CMRS). Furthermore, the contractor's proposed CMRS must be able to use current DoD programs, databases, processes, or provide functional links to them to assimilate data and reports. The proposed system must be easily compatible, easily upgradeable, and able to share data with sister services (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps). Additionally, the proposed CMRS must be adaptable to changes in surveys, reporting and metadata. Furthermore, the system must use the DoD's Human Factors Taxonomy, currently, the DOD Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (DoD HFACS). The assessment tools utilized by the proposed CMRS shall meet accepted scientific standards in both reliability and validity. For reporting requirements, the proposed CMRS will provide reports from both the unit and command level, pushed rather than requested by the intended end-user. The contractor's system will also be required to provide an easily understood and trainable system to perform pull data mining. The contractor will be required to take requirements from the joint service systems user configuration control board (CCB), update progress and report using CCB identified metrics to the same board.</p>
<p>The contractor must meet the needs for a DoD web site, and certification is required. Furthermore, the contractor must comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the DoD Information Assurance directives. The proposed CMRS must also maintain an archive for surveys, information, and risk analysis tools. An additional requirement is that the contractor provides expert interpretation for survey results and quality control of mishap interventions. Finally, all reports provided by the contractor's proposed CMRS must be configurable to provide data for expert analysis as well as to inform commanders. Ultimately, CMRS must be capable of fusing and reporting the collected data in an easily understood format. The CMRS system will be open source and compatible with current technologies for data extracting, mining, reporting, and be web-enabled and capable of fusing with other data through web services and common COTS or Open Source based business intelligence tools. In addition, it should be easily adaptable into a Service Oriented Architecture. The software must also support the DoD net-centric policy, specifically, Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) that includes security service, content discovery, and content dissemination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed CMRS system should include all accessories needed to implement the system, to include a test plan for development, training, and integrating the system. The proposed test plan must contain milestones for an initial operating capability and a follow on plan for full operational capability. The proposed CMRS must be a commercial off the shelf item, which has been tested and used in the field under operational conditions for a minimum of 3 months. The contractor must also affirm whether their proposed software has a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 (Defined) or higher.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The Safety Center envisions a briefing to industry prior to release of the RFP to ensure offerors have an opportunity to comment on the proposed evaluation factors, and to answer all questions, which will subsequently be placed online. Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, point of contact, address, system description, technical information, number of months used in field operations, and a rough order cost estimate based on systems delivered in 2009 or 2008. Please limit responses to no more than 25 pages. SOC's may be submitted to PCO noted below.</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than close of business (COB) July&nbsp;28, 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2(b)(1). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL. The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Florida State University (FSU). The purpose of the requirement is to determine optimal parameter settings for the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) and the optimal usage of its inline tracer capability for transport and dispersion modeling. The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Penn State University and is considered the United States meteorological community mesoscale model. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of both WRF with its tracer capability, and WRF using other transport and dispersion models for comparison. The anticipated period of performance is 24 months from date of award. FSU is the only source known to be capable of fulfilling the government's requirement. FSU has unique experience in long range transport issues, having participated in seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants. Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres. This vast experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement. This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research. FSU prepared various T&amp;D products for each project using a variety of meteorological model output ranging from global models down to the locally run Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5). By viewing the trajectories and comparing them with airborne in situ data, FSU has obtained vast experience in assessing the quality of trajectories and other T&amp;D parameters. Other research projects have given FSU extensive experience in sensitivity studies of additional mesoscale models (e.g., the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and their applicability to transport and dispersion analyses. FSU has extensive experience with both mesoscale and transport and dispersion models. Finally, the FSU personnel can consult (at no cost) with other inhouse meteorological faculty who also are experts in running the WRF model. The solicitation for this requirement will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP). It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, with a size standard of 500. Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling DUN &amp; Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505). This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for turbine overhauls that require new seal rings, ranging in size from 140" to 188" in diameter. The new seal rings will be installed on 130 megawatt (178,000 horsepower) hydroelectric Francis type turbines and will have running clearances no greater than 0.045" radial between the rotating and stationary seal rings. Past seal ring replacements utilized nickel-aluminum bronze paired against austenitic stainless steels such as CF8/304L. Wear rates observed using these materials were excessive, primarily on the aluminum bronze rings. Nitronic 60 stainless, with excellent mechanical properties, is now being used in place of the aluminum bronze to extend the life of the turbine seal rings and improving the long-term efficiency of the turbines.  All Offerors must demonstrate experience in the fabrication of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) seal rings either by centrifugal casting or ring roll forging with an outer dimension (OD) of 165.500".  Submittals after contract award shall include, but are not limited to, the following:  
(1)  A Detailed Schedule Plan. (2)  Recommended procedure and facility details.(3)  Test reports of the metallurgical properties.  (4)  Quality control documents.  (5)  Technical design fabrication process. 
This acquisition, when announced, will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 331513 Steel Foundries (except Investment), size standard of 500 employees.
Capability statements are to be submitted not later than July 23, 2009.  The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed above.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, business size and type ( 8)(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Demonstration of the firm's experience shown by providing a list of actual jobs completed within the past five years in which your firm as the (OEM) completed stationary seal rings either by centrifugal casting or ring roll forging.  Additionally, for each job listed provide the following: a brief description of the work performed, project title, dollar value of the job, the company name, location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed.  Experience shall include a minimum of three projects fabricating to OEM drawing of OD (outer dimension) 165.5" stationary seal rings.
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Cristina Hayden/LC-3132, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail chayden@usbr.gov.  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award, based upon the availability of funds, a contract entitled Characterization and Potential Impacts of Noise Producing Construction and Operation Activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15:  Contracting by Negotiation.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  The anticipated period of performance is 60 months, which consists of a 24 month Baseline Data-Phase I, and a 36 month Option, Phase II.  The estimated cost range is between $350,000 and $500,000.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541690:  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Service.  All potential offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein.  DESCRIPTION:  The renewable energy industry is rapidly evolving in the face of changing energy markets, technologies, and governmental policies.  Currently wind is of greatest interest because of its proven technology, however planning for this future cannot be based on past experience alone.  Limited ocean-based renewable energy development has occurred world-wide and this has been primarily wind power, located offshore of Europe.  Renewable energy projects link to an electricity market that is very different from the petroleum-based industry MMS manages under the OCS Lands Act.  These projects will also have very different potential environmental effects and operational needs than do offshore petroleum projects.  Based on current expressions of industry interests, MMS expects that most, if not all, renewable energy projects and activities in the foreseeable future will focus on portions of the MMS Atlantic OCS.  These are frontier areas with no current renewable energy operations.The construction of offshore renewable facilities will ultimately introduce a considerable amount of noise into the marine environment for some period.  To better understand the cumulative effects of noise from renewable construction and development activities on the OCS, the MMS will conduct a study to characterize all aspects of noise-producing activities, such as pile driving, during the construction and operation of an offshore wind facility.  The study will characterize both specific sources of noise from MMS-permitted actions associated with the construction and operation of an offshore wind facility, as well as ambient noise measurements on the Atlantic OCS.  Major noise-producing activities will be identified, and may include activities in addition to pile driving, and measurements of noise from these activities will be recorded and reported in appropriate units of measurement to estimate the acoustic footprint of the activities duration, frequency, intensity, and relative contribution to ambient noise levels.  These data will help quantify the relative contribution to ambient noise levels and consequently, the potential impact(s) to marine resources from the introduction of sound into the marine environment.  This study should occur within the next year and would include field work to measure ambient noise levels and then evaluate the sound generated during construction and operation activities.  
PURPOSE:  The objectives of this study are:  1-Baseline Data: Phase I - to identify and characterize the levels and sources of ambient noise (both man-made and natural) in surrounding waters within the areas of concern (to be determined by the MMS) prior to construction of an offshore wind facility; and 2-Option- Phase II to field-measure actual levels of underwater noise generated during the construction and operation of the facility and to estimate the potential impacts (behavior, number of species present during activities, etc.) to the species present in the area as determined from analyses of the ambient acoustic data (Baseline Data).  In addition, signal acquisition, detection, processing, and identification would be required for entire project (Baseline Data and Option Phase II).  BACKGROUND:  The MMS is charged with the responsibility of considering the effects of its actions on significant resources on the OCS of the United States, from state waters to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  Offshore facilities generate noise during construction and operation.  The impacts from pile driving result in substantial noise energy transmission within the water column.  The MMS needs to understand the zone of influence from sound generated by these activities as well as measure existing ambient noise levels in order to determine potential impacts (behavior, number of species present during activities, etc.) to marine mammals, sea turtles, fish, and the surrounding habitats. SCOPE OF WORK:  The location of the study area will be determined by the MMS but will be in two (2) of the locations below (within the US Exclusive Economic Zone) and within the Atlantic OCS Planning Area Boundaries.  The areas for possible collection to be determined by MMS (2 areas minimum):  1) Horseshoe Shoal off the coast of Cape Cod; 2) Offshore New Jersey/Delaware; 3) Offshore Rhode Island; 4) Offshore Georgia; 5) Offshore South/North Carolina; or 6) Offshore Florida.  The Contractor shall assume the area to be approximately ten (10) miles offshore of the State coastline.  HOW TO RESPOND:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please email your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone number, email address and DUNS number not later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Wednesday,  July 29, 2009, to debra.bridge@mms.gov, or send this same information to Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, Virginia  20170.  Please reference, in your response, Solicitation Number M09PS00078, Characterization and Potential Impacts of Noise Producing Construction and Operation Activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  Those organizations responding to this announcement will receive a copy of the full Request for Proposal when it is issued.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

INTRODUCTION:

This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e).  No formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation will be issued.  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, is seeking qualified sources that can provide seeker systems for target recognition, and sensor correlation and like technologies to determine the current technology and manufacturing readiness levels for integration into the Tomahawk Cruise Missile. This Request for Information is required to gather data on both active and passive seeker systems that can provide target recognition, discrimination, and positive identification of ships underway at sea.  

TECHNICAL, COST AND SCHEDULE INFORMATION REQUESTED:

War-fighting Objective:

The Tomahawk Weapons System Program Office (PMA-280) is exploring the potential development of a Maritime Interdiction missile variant for the U.S. Navy, which will require the integration of a seeker.  Information provided via this request will be used to evaluate and assess the feasibility of a Multi-Mission Tomahawk (MMT) concept using the existing Tactical Tomahawk Block IV weapon system infrastructure (i.e., weapons control systems, mission planning systems, and launcher systems) that has added a moving target seeker, as well as an upgraded Weapons Data-link.  The Tomahawk Block IV is launched vertically from surface ships, and launched both vertically and horizontally from submarines.  The MMT flight profile will, depending on range, include an optimized profile outside the threat range of the firing unit (FRU) platform, and will transition to sea skim as required for threat avoidance.  The MMT will have the ability to receive in-flight target updates to aid in locating the target for execution of the terminal phase.  

Seeker Requirements and Performance:

The seeker must have the ability to acquire maritime targets, day or night, guide missile to target and provide target discrimination of various tracks and identification of the correct target within the field of view.  The maritime interdiction search area (see Figure 1) is defined as a circle covering approximately 30 square nautical miles with a total of eight maritime (white and red) vessels operating inside this search area.  The assumed scenario for a seeker enabled MMT engagement (from FRU to the target) will span (or exceed) 500 nm in a robust denied access environment due to electronic attack jamming. Complex electronic attack is expected for the missile during the endgame to include:
	aggressive EA expected against the seeker from both the target and counter-targeting escorts in proximity to the target; 
	GPS jamming against the missile, again from the maritime target and counter-targeting or escort vessels; and 
	Weapons Data Link jamming against the missile and a Third Party Source which is providing real time target position updates to the missile.
Additionally, it is anticipated that within the target area of uncertainty there will exist a cluttered littoral surface target environment that may include surface-ship decoys and an aggressive electronic radio frequency (RF) environment. The MMT seeker must be capable of searching a target area of uncertainty (TAU) resulting from an assumed target speed of 30 knots (maximum), taking into account the target location error (TLE) of the third party targeting source (P-3 LSRS, P-8, E-2, JSTARS, MH-60R, BAMS), and the loss of in-flight target updates to the missile for 5 minutes prior to missile arrival at the intended target.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

	A description and assessment of the seeker(s) technology recommended for this application including:
o	Description of the seeker aperture  technology once interfaced with the missile, and
o	Impacts to aperture design to account for launch from three missile launch configurations.

	A description of the risk areas in the sensor system development, integration, demonstration and manufacturing program phases.

	An assessment of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components). 

	An assessment of the integration readiness of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components) with the Tomahawk missile and weapons system (i.e., control system and mission planning).

	An assessment of the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) of the seeker.

	A detailed description of the range resolution of the seeker as well as field of regard required to recognize, discriminate, and identify ships at sea in the full range of environmental effects including: rain, fog, humidity, at full range of sea states.

	A description of the speed regimes that the seeker is capable of operating in and the effects speed may have on the seeker capability to recognize, discriminate and identify ships at sea.

	A description of the sensor technology capability to operate in a high threat environment consisting of electronic countermeasures and electronic support measures.

	An assessment of the impact of an active/passive seeker on EO/IR/RF signature of the missile during entry into the target area.

	A description of any seeker subsystem components (e.g. seeker-mode mission control processor) or functionality (e.g., image/target storage and recognition) that will be located in the missile outside the  nose section.

	A description of how the seeker will interface with the flight computer to provide steering commands and if there is a requirement for computer storage outside the seeker subsystem.

	A description of how the seeker will be integrated into the pre-launch sequence which includes: checks of hardware and software; loading of missile flight software, mission data and strike data; and alignment of the Inertial Measurement Unit.

	A description of sensor information processing requirements including the data buses, speed of bus, data rate needed, type and quantity of each data type across the interface, the data itself: (e.g. navigation position update versus steering commands), the type of target/image data, and storage required for target/templates.

	If the seeker system is dependent on outside sources for track queuing or search pattern recognition, a description of the data rates and protocols, and the correlation algorithms used to find and maintain target tracking within an area of uncertainty.

	If the seeker is dependent on a cooling system to operate, define the cool-down time and initialization time from the time the seeker subsystem is turned on until the seeker subsystem is ready for operation. 

	An analysis of the effectiveness of the seeker in acquiring, tracking and hitting the intended targets within the maritime interdiction search area defined in Figure 1.  Although not part of this analysis, describe how the proposed seeker would be beneficial during the land-attack mode.

	Identify seeker and subsystem maintenance requirements (calibration, cooling system re-charging, etc.), associated schedules, and data or analysis on useful life. 
 
Figure 1.

Size Constraints:

The seeker system is expected to be integrated within the existing space available in the Tomahawk Block IV missile nose section.  The overall external dimensions of the nose section are approximately 20 inches in diameter at the aft end and 41 inches in length.  The external contour of the nose section, looking from aft-to-forward ends, slopes inward toward the vehicle centerline forming a hemispherical-like point with an aerodynamic chine surface.  The seeker subsystem must be located inside a sealed housing that is installed inside the nose section.  The fuel volume displaced by the seeker housing will obviously result in a reduction of the current propulsive range of the Block IV missile.  Therefore, it is operationally advantageous to keep the seeker housing volume as small as practical.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

	A dimensioned drawing, schematic or other illustration of the seeker subsystem arranged in its sealed housing.

	An estimate of the overall volume displaced. 

	A description of any changes necessary to the nose structure of the missile such as radome material or window for infrared seeker.

Weight:

The weight of the potential seeker system added to the front of the missile is expected to have some affect on the vehicles center of gravity (CG) characteristics.  Ideally, the overall weight of the seeker system should be as low as practical.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

	The total weight (in pounds) of the seeker system and a weight breakdown for the major components.

	A drawing, schematic or other illustration of the seeker subsystem arranged in its sealed housing showing the approximate location of the assemblys CG.

Power Consumption:

During the boost phase of flight the missile gets electrical power from the "CMA battery" which is a pyrotechnic activated lithium thermal battery.  Within the battery are two independent cell stacks to power the regulated and unregulated buses.  The CMA battery outputs DC power to the Power Filter Unit (PFU) before distribution to the missile components.   During the cruise and terminal phases of flight, the Block IV missile is provided  electrical power from an alternator.  The alternator is an engine shaft mounted, three-phase permanent magnet generator.  The Alternator Voltage Control Converter (AVCC) converts variable frequency AC power from the alternator into two DC voltage outputs used by the missile electrical system.  Output No. 1 is a regulated 29V (29.0 Vdc +/- 1.0 Vdc) output, and Output No. 2 is a 40V semi-regulated (26V to 43V) output.  Output No. 2 is loaded by switched loads such as the fin control system actuators and is much noisier than Output No.1.  An electrical power analysis will have to be performed by PMA280 to assess the available margins in terms of amperage available without changing the existing electrical system.  In order to facilitate such an evaluation, the electrical power requirements for a potential seeker system must be known.  Respondents to this RFI should provide:

	A narrative description of the seeker(s) electrical system including schematics, diagrams or graphs useful for conducting the evaluation described above. 

	The expected subsystem loads in terms of worst case amperages at specified voltage(s) (steady state and transient) across each seeker mode as applicable including: power-up, searching, passive and active operations, and imaging.

	Possible sequencing/stepping of loads such that the load required during the missile  phases of operation is minimal during:

o	Prelaunch for Built-in-Test (BIT) and image/target download;
o	Boost if needed at all;
o	Cruise for cooling and possible image/target download with continuous BIT;
o	Terminal for full seeker operation.

Environmental Conditions:

Integration of a seeker subsystem into the Block IV missile will certainly involve some qualification or design validation testing.   Existing information for a potential seekers capability to operate reliably in these environments will aid PMA280 in assessing the overall scope of testing required and the level of program risk.  Respondents to this RFI should provide any applicable testing or analysis information relevant to sensor storage and operation while being subjected to the following environmental concerns:

	Temperature extremes
	Pressure extremes 
	Humidity
	Rain
	Snow
	Sand and Dust
	Wind
	Salt Atmosphere
	Salt Water Immersion
	Acceleration 
	Transit Drop Shock
	Transit Vibration
	Stowage Vibration
	Pre-launch Vibration
	Boost and Cruise Flight Vibration
	Pendulum Impact Shock
	High Impact (i.e. Barge) Shock
	Flight Acoustics
	DC Magnetics
	Electromagnetic Interference, Vulnerability, Compatibility (EMI/EMV/EMC)
	Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance
 
Cost and Schedule:

Respondents to this RFI should provide:

	An estimate of non-recurring engineering cost of integration and demonstration in a representative captive carry environment that fully exercises the system capabilities to recognize, discriminate and identify ships underway at sea.  Provide any assumptions made regarding government furnished property, facilities or other support.

	An estimate of the seeker subsystems unit cost for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 40 units, followed by a Full-Rate Production quantity varying between 200 and  400 units per year on an annual procurement basis.

	An estimated schedule for achieving TRL Level 6 in preparation for a system Milestone B review.  Describe any proof of concept and integration level testing required to achieve TRL Level 6.

	A top level description of a program plan and schedule for achieving a mature production program of the seeker.

<RESPDATE>081209
<ARCHDATE>09122009
<CONTACT>Ruth Gullette703 432-5249
<DESC>The Program Manager Test Measurement and Diagnostics Equipment, Marine Corps Systems Command (PM TMDE, MARCORSYSCOM), is conducting a technology study that will support development of objective sources of action associated with Next Generation Ground Marine Corps Automatic Test System (NGEN ATS) support requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an NGEN ATS effort which culminates in a technical analysis that will identify alternative Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions that meet current and future NGEN ATS capability requirements.  As such, MARCORSYSCOM seeks industry input that identifies candidate solutions that have been developed or are in development that will satisfy current/future NGEN ATS requirements. NGEN ATS is envisioned to be a reconfigurable test system capable of supporting a wide variety of Marine Corps electronic, electrical, electro-mechanical, and electro-optical ground weapon systems/support equipment and will be employed within the Marine Corps' three Level Maintenance Concept. PM TMDE is required to support current and emerging weapon systems with minimal proliferation of special purpose test equipment. Instead of weapon system program managers providing their own specialized support solutions, the goal of PM TMDE is to provide a common, multi-functional test system capable of supporting the troubleshooting and repair of multiple equipment platforms. Toward that end, PM TMDE has procured and fielded several generations of General Purpose Automatic Test Systems to the Marine Corps.  However, technological advances in weapon system design and performance, coupled with impending obsolescence of fielded ATS instrumentation, dictate that a next-generation test solution must be identified and employed in order to meet the demands of future combat systems. NGEN ATS capabilities are categorized in the three following areas: Test and Diagnose; Collect, Store, Analyze and Display; and Standards and Operational Requirements. (See attachment for specific capabilities envisioned for NGEN ATS). RFI submissions should include company name, address, point of contact, and email address. Responses should incorporate as much detailed information as possible to include, but not limited to: Technology/System information: (1) provide manufacturer/developer name and describe company competencies; (2) white papers and/or product literature that describe the functionality/capability of the technology(ies) or system(s); (3) technical/performance information (e.g., weight, dim! ensions, power supply); Operations concept for the technology(ies) or system(s) (e.g., how it is employed, role and number of operators); current employment (if any) by other organizations; current technology maturity or technology readiness level (TRL) and maturation plans; and relation/integration with and dependence upon other technologies or systems. Cost information: (1) procurement (unit) costs - describe unit baseline capability against the NGEN ATS requirements above and provide unit prices for the baseline - describe if the units are warranted, and if so, describe the coverage (e.g., labor, parts, and shipping), the duration of the warranty in months, and what triggers the warranty - describe if there are special tools required to repair the units and, if so, provide the Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost of each kit/tool and the kit to unit ratio (e.g., 1:1, 1:3) - provide the delivery date. (2) development Costs - describe if modifications to your existing test suites would be required in order to meet all Marine Corps and NGEN ATS requirements and describe the modifications as hardware, firmware or software if software or firmware development describe the size of the modification in Function Points, size metric and if CCAs, describe how many and how complex.  Describe the ROMs for the changes and the proposed schedule by currently unmet ATS requirement. (3) support Costs - describe the range of contractor support that is available for the units (e.g., 24x7, CONUS only, in-theater) - describe if there are consumables for these units - describe if these units come with generators and, if not, describe if the units are configured for generator (standalone) power - describe the power requirement for the baseline unit(s) and with each add-on. Any proprietary information submitted may be used in establishing requirements, but specific offeror information will be safeguarded as proprietary. There is no page restriction associated with this RFI; however, an executive summary, not to exceed five (5) pages, should accompany each submission. The Marine Corps will use the results of this announcement to determine what capabilities currently exist in the marketplace which meet the Government's requirements outlined above. Interested vendors are requested to submit their responses no later than 2:00pm EST, 12 August 2009.  All submissions shall be UNCLASSIFIED and include a hard copy version along with one electronic (soft) copy on a CD-ROM formatted for a personal computer.  Submissions should be sent to: Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Contracts - PG16 (CT 023), ATTN: Ruth Gullette, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050. E-MAIL SUBMISSIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an obligation by the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input submitted in response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Vendors responding to this RFI, understand that Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Tecolote Research, Inc., and Uchil, LLC  under a Technology Study for PM TMDE, MARCORSYSCOM, will be reviewing and collating all responses to this RFI. MARCORSYSCOM point of contact for questions regarding this RFI is Ruth Gullette, (703) 432-5249.

Vendor:
Michael MancusoMancuso Botanical Services20 North Wilson St.Boise, ID 83706
Michael Mancuso is regarded as the species expert for Astragalus cusickii var. packardiae.  He is essentially the only individual that has worked with the species and the author of the only two reports relating to the species ( Mancuso 1999 and DRAFT Mancuso 2009).  He initiated development of the monitoring protocol in 2008, in addition to surveying sites for presence/absence.  Completing the establishment of the monitoring program is one of the tasks identified for 2009.  Since Michael did the initial survey work and mapped suitable habitat from aerial photos in 1999 and established most of the monitoring program in 2008, he is most qualified to perform subsequent surveys and complete the monitoring program for the species.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis.  Qualifications include: familiarity with the current projects related to the development of drugs for the treatment of cocaine abuse; intimate familiarity with the development of drugs as therapeutic agents; extensive and current working knowledge of radiotelemetry methods for the measuring of cardiovascular function in unrestrained conscious, freely moving laboratory animals; extensive knowledge of the development of parametric functions analogous to pharmacokinetic functions suitable for modeling the cardiovascular (HR and BP) response profile to drugs; familiarity with current methods for the analysis of telemetric data that provide an unbiased picture of the shape of the time course of action; and working knowledge of isobolographic analysis of drug combinations.
The proposed studies will analyze the hemodynamic effects induced by drugs being developed as agonist treatments for cocaine abuse, and currently under investigation in our laboratories. These drugs, with selectivity for the dopamine transporter, have the advantage of producing behavioral effects clearly differentiated from those of cocaine.  Adult (16-week-old) male rats supplied by Charles River Laboratories or equivalent will be acclimatized to standard laboratory conditions and housed in individual cages for 1 week before surgery, with free access to food and water.  Rats will be anesthetized with an intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). A midline laparotomy will be performed, and a segment (about 1 cm below the renal arteries) of the abdominal aorta will be isolated. The catheter tip will be inserted into the aorta just above the iliac bifurcation, the transmitter will be fixed to the muscles, and the abdominal wall will be sutured. After recovery from anesthesia, the rats will be housed individually in cages placed on the receivers. Gentamicin (5 mg/kg twice daily) will be administered for 2 days after surgery to prevent infection.  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be recorded and analyzed by a Dataquest 4 system (Data Sciences Intl). The system consists of BP sensors (model TA11PAC40), receivers (model RA1010), a consolidation matrix (BCM100), a personal computer, and Dataquest 4 software.  Hemodynamic recordings will be taken every 5 minutes, starting 2 hours before drug administration and for 24 hours thereafter. Each recording lasting 10 seconds, and the hemodynamic values of all cardiac cycles within this period (about 50 at baseline) will be averaged.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2009128 may be submitted to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, anticipates award of a modification to contract N00164-06-C-6960 that will cover FY10 - FY11 service requirements related to US Navy submarine storage batteries.  This will be a sole source procurement to Exide Technologies, Aurora, IL based on FAR 6.302-1, only one source capable of meeting the Government's requirements.  A firm-fixed price contract modification is anticipated.  Requirements covered will be field and maintenance services for Exide main storage batteries on submarines that are in service (i.e., not under construction).  The Navy is in the process of transitioning from the flooded lead acid batteries to Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA batteries); installation of batteries are beginning to shift away from flooded lead acid to VRLA batteries.  As part of the field services effort the contractor is required to make routine visits at least once a year to each submarine as authorized by the Government, and make emergency visits as authorized.  The maintenance portion of the effort requires the contractor to have a complete maintenance program for all batteries on submarines.  Requirements specific to battery type require assistance in the planning, installation, testing, checkout, adjustment, disassembly and repair of submarine battery cells; and performance of on-the-job instruction and training of Navy personnel (military and/or civilian).  It is estimated that 3.5 man-years per year will be necessary to complete the requirements.  The applicable NAICS classification is 541330 and the size standard is 500.  A Confidential Security Clearance is required.  Interested parties may submit inquiries by sending an email to lorna.tribby@navy.mil.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br />THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED EPA TARGETED BROWNFIELDS ASSESSMENTS (TBA) CONTRACTS.</strong>
<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the intention to competitively award a Task Order from the EPA Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer #28. The period of performance will be from August 24, 2009 though February 28, 2010.</p>
<p>The Kingman Airport Authority has responsibility for the management and oversight of the Kingman Airport and Industrial Park, a business center. Future economic development plans include citing new facilities to attract and house new businesses in the area. One area of the airport property, the burn pit site, has been identified as a potential area for redevelopment. The Kingman Airport Authority is requesting assistance to complete the needed Phase II work to facilitate cleanup planning, remediation, then redevelopment to bring high end jobs to the State. <br />The area of concern, the burn pit area, is approximately 16 acres. Fuel bladders, debris, and possibly solvents were dumped and burned in the area. It appears that the surface and subsurface soils have been impacted from the burning. The horizontal and vertical extent of contamination in the pit area is not known. It is believed that leaded petroleum fuel may be the predominant waste.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDERS. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</strong></p>

<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole-source contract for parking at Chicago OHare International Airport (ORD) to Standard Parking Corporation, 900 N. Michigan Avenue, Suite 1600, Chicago, IL  60611-6539.  

A parking space is needed for TSA, Office of Inspection (OI) to allow TSA personnel daily access to the airport to perform inspections.  A parking space at ORD for use by OI staff is necessary because the field office is located off airport property and personnel makes visits to the airport on a regular basis to complete their missions.  Parking off site and taking a shuttle to the airport for these activities is not suitable because of the frequency of visits (sometimes multiple trips a day to ORD).  In addition, TSA personnel may transport employees to and from the field office and parking must be readily available for these purposes.
  
TSA intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source.
This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals.  All interested firms must respond July 27, 2009 at 9:00 a.m. local Washington D.C. time to Gladys Wilks, REF:  HSTS03-09-P-INS026, gladys.wilks@dhs.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  TSA will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM
Hartford Job Corps Academy, operated by Education Management Corporation, is located in Hartford Connecticut, is a federally funded educational and job training facility. There are a total of 200 students between the ages of 16 to 24, including 136 residential and 64 non-resident students, all from the local community, the northern and southern portion of Connecticut and bordering states.   
Enrollees in the program are screened by the Academy and Federal recruitment agencies. Common criterion for eligibility is the need and desire to learn a skill to become more employable. Enrollees are generally considered healthy, but physical and emotional problems can be present and therefore must be considered and addressed. Some of the 200 authorized students may at any time be enrolled under the auspices of special disability programs, which accommodate students with a variety of physical impairments without age restrictions.
The program meets the needs of each individual and focuses on four (4) specific areas that enable the student to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of career success standard and core values.
Besides educational and vocational opportunities, students receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all students who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist students with their individual needs. Also when training is completed, Career Transition services are provided to assist with job placement and pursing independent living
 
BIDDERS INSTRUCTIONS
Bidders attention is drawn to the Request for Proposal and tentative subcontract attached.  It is anticipated that the draft subcontract shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder, with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidders proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses in order to prepare a response to provide Physician services.  In addition, Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Appendices, and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of Mr. William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.
The successful bidder will be selected based upon a combination of professional expertise, quality of technical services and reasonableness of cost.  Bidders are placed on notice that bids in excess of available funding for Physician services may not be found within the competitive range.  The Hartford Job Corps Academy reserves the right to reject any and all bids if no individual bid is found to be acceptable.
The scope of work indicates minimum staffing/service requirements which must be provided.  Bidders are encouraged to offer supplemental staffing/services either on or off Academy.  Bidders should specifically state what types and quantity of supplemental staffing and/or services are being offered.
The Hartford Job Corps Academy reserves the right to award a subcontract as a complete contract package including services and material, or as a services only contract.
Proposals must not just repeat the requirements contained in the RFP/Draft Contract, but must provide the specifics of who, what, how and when clearly indicating the bidders level of understanding and ability to provide the level of service required.  It is not anticipated at this time that there will be a best and final opportunity to refine proposals.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number is AG-0120-S-09-0061R and this solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.

This is a small business set-aside with an associated NAICS code of 238210 and small business size standard of $14 million dollars. 

The following are this solicitations list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure:   001 Equipment and materials
                               002 Labor for installation

Description of requirements for the items to be acquired  
The Chugach National Forest  Glacier Ranger District is initiating a project that will give anyone with internet access the opportunity to view real-time video of migrating and spawning salmon through an underwater camera.  This camera shall be placed in Williwaw Creek, in Portage Valley, at the site of the Williwaw Salmon Viewing Platform.  A remote source of power will be needed to run the system and must be provided by the contractor. However, an internet network access point is only about 150 feet away from the proposed location of the camera.

The primary goal of this project is to provide live internet-accessible footage of spawning salmon in Williwaw Creek from about late July through September each year.  Network access and connection at the pedestal will be coordinated by the Forest Service through a partnership with a local internet provider.  However, the remainder of the projects system installation and start up operations are the goal of this acquisition and the responsibility of the contractor.

The Forest Services expectations for this video system include the need for a remote source of power (likely wind and/or sun) adequate to run the cameras and charge a set of deep cycle batteries, simultaneously.  Noise from the power generation shall be minimized, especially during high wind events, due to the proximity to a campground.  Batteries shall have adequate capacity to run the system for at least seven (7) days in the event that recharging doesnt occur due to lack of wind or sun.  The video cameras shall be rated for underwater use and shall provide a quality color picture during daylight hours.  Video cameras may be attached to existing pilings under the viewing platform and mounting hardware shall be sufficient to keep cameras in place in the event of higher water.  The need for artificial lighting is not expected.  Every component of this system shall maintain integrity and function properly under the environmental conditions common in Portage Valley  strong winds, occasionally near 100 mph, heavy rain, and extreme cold during the winter.  Cameras shall be mounted so they can be removed for winter storage.  If batteries cannot be removed from their storage box, they shall be capable of over wintering in storage box without being damaged by cold temps.  Extent of warranties and contractors customer service once the system is in place should be specified and included with quote. 

Technical Requirements

A. TOWER:
Any tower or mounting systems used for wind and sun power generation will need to be designed in a way that components can reasonably be removed for repair or storage.  Additionally, all towers and mounting systems will need to blend into the existing vegetation as much as possible.

The contractor will be responsible for all labor (beyond equipment operations) required for installation of the tower, tower mount, and anchors.  The contractor shall provide, with their proposal, the specifications for the tower mount and anchors and any additional materials needed (ie. concrete, support cables, etc).

B. REMOTE POWER:
The remote power source for this system will need to be adequate to run the entire system while simultaneously keeping power storage devises fully charged.  Some form of back up power storage will need to be incorporated into the system that allows the camera to run for at least seven days in the event of a lack of wind or sun.
 
C. WIRING:
All wiring shall be selected, sized and installed to the appropriate standards (IEEE, etc.).  Wiring on the tower and outside of an enclosure shall be appropriately selected (flooded core, etc.) and shall have waterproof connections installed.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition shall be procured using full and open competition.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Optical Technology Division, is developing measurement methods, standards, and services for optical grating scatterometry and requires a microspot spectroscopic ellipsometer capable of making measurements from small micropatterned periodic structures.   

These structures are one-dimensional or two-dimensional gratings that can be as small as 50 micrometers on a side and fabricated on silicon wafers.  A single wafer or chip may contain many such target gratings and NIST needs to be able to navigate between them.  NIST intends to measure the reflectance properties of these targets and compare the results of theoretical calculations (supplied by NIST) to determine the dimensions of the target structures.  While scatterometry measurements are typically made with the angle of incidence aligned along the grating direction, NIST intends to use the ellipsometer to perform measurements along other directions as well to enhance sensitivity to grating structure. NIST will also use the ellipsometer for traditional thin film measurements and will use the vendors  software for data analysis.
		
In its simplest form, an ellipsometer measures the ratio of the reflection coefficients for s- and p- polarizations as a complex number.  This ratio may be expressed in terms of real angles delta and psi, in terms of the tangent of psi and the cosine of delta, or in terms of alpha and beta.  These terms are generally accepted in the field and are defined in, for example, H.G. Tompkins, A Users Guide to Ellipsometry (Academic Press, Boston, 1993).  

The required ellipsometer shall, at a minimum, measure any of these pairs of values.  The ellipsometer software shall provide estimates of the variance of and covariance between these values propagated from the noise in the measurement such that at each wavelength the ellipsometric parameters expressed in any of the above formats, along with a correctly propagated noise estimates, can be output for analysis by the user.

In a generalized form, an ellipsometer can measure the ratios of the elements of the sample Jones matrix.  Generalized ellipsometers measure the ratios of the elements of the sample Jones matrix.  Generalized ellipsometers are preferred. 

All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for all of the following line items:

<CONTACT>Joan Coulter, Business Opportunity Specialist, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email coulterj@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Schrodinger LLC, 101 SW Main Street, Suite 1300, Portland, Oregon 97204, to renew NIH-wide licenses for a group of Schrodinger proprietary molecular modeling software products and support. CIT has acquired annual licenses to Schrodinger molecular modeling software products on a sole-source basis since 2000 which currently consist of interchangeable tokens (i.e., "floating licenses") that allow NIH researchers to concurrently run the various Schrodinger molecular modeling software products as required. Renewal of the Schrodinger software licenses are required by the Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM), Division of Computational Bioscience, CIT. CMM is a major supplier of molecular resources and expertise to the NIH research community, organizes molecular modeling users at the NIH by sponsoring the NIH inter-institute Molecular Modeling Interest Group, and created a distributed molecular modeling environment that is accessible from UNIX workstations and personal computers maintained by individual NIH investigators. CMM's computational chemists collaborate with NIH researchers on molecular modeling-related projects by providing expertise on scientific interests that include modeling of macromolecular structure and dynamics, structure-function relationships of macromolecules, macromolecular interactions, and ligand binding. In order to continue providing expert support to the NIH research community, CMM requires the continued use of commercially available molecular modeling software products for the 12-month period of 08-01-09 through 07-31-10 that provide all of the following functionalities: (1) a powerful and innovative software application for accurate protein structure predictions; (2) a fully-integrated protein structure program that provides an easy-to-use interface that takes a novice user intuitively from sequence to alignment to refined structure; (3) the ability to provide the expert user complete control over calculational settings to maximize accuracy of predictions; (4) a powerful and complete tool for generating accurate receptor models for structure-based drug design; (5) the ability to combine leading force fields, accurate effective solvation models, and advanced conformational searching methods that provide the most complete molecular modeling package suitable for a wide array of research; (6) a complete solution for ligand-receptor docking which provides the full spectrum of speed and accuracy from high-throughput virtual screening of millions of compounds to extremely accurate binding mode predictions with consistently high enrichment at every level; and (7) the ability of the software products to work with each other to simulate receptor flexibility in response to ligand-binding events. After consulting with NIH researchers, particularly from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), CIT has determined that the Schrodinger software products are the only commercially available ones that can provide the required combination of comprehensive molecular modeling functionalities described above that are required by NIH researchers. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their molecular modeling software applications and support which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide software and support that can fulfill all of the requirements specified above. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for these commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror's Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. The contractor shall comply with all other applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within seventeen (17) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-09-139-JC shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Joan Coulter, Business Opportunity Specialist at jc224a@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Joan Coulter (301) 496-6546; Fax 301 402-0642.</p>

<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a.Ken Marston is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543.<br />b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-09-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

(Bauer Model 8731 or Equal)<br />Computer controlled twin spindle nut runner providing torque up to 332 ft-lbs (450 Nm). The electrically driven nut runners are mounted on a positioning fixture that allows accurate and easy adjustment of their spacing to match the bolt diameter of the aircraft wheel. The operator's interface is conveniently located directly above the nut runners so that process is in full view and control of the operator. The entire assembly is suspended from an air balanced cable on a post-mounted overhead swing boom.<br />The nut runners can be programmed for torque control, angle control or a combination of torque and angle control. The nut runners have a synchronized torque control feature that enables each nut runner to safely act as the reaction bar for the other nut runner. The nut runners are mounted to a fixture that allows accurate and easy adjustment of the nut runner spacing. The positioning fixture includes a slide with two moving saddles on which the nut runners are mounted. A single adjustment moves both saddles in or out allowing the operator to quickly and easily adjust the distance between the nut runners from a minimum distance of 7 in (177 mm) to a maximum of up to 26 in (660 mm) to achieve the required wheel bolt diameter. A scale is provided on the fixture to indicate their position. <br />The operator interface is the touch screen monitor and an integral PC (Windows operating system). The monitor is conveniently mounted to the nut runner positioning fixture and is located directly in front of the operator at a convenient working height when he is using the torquing system. <br />Easy to follow instructions are provided so that the appropriate torque data for specific aircraft wheels may be entered. Once the data is entered into the system, the operator simply selects a wheel part number from a menu displayed on the operator's interface screen. The operator will be prompted to enter the tracking number for the wheel being assembled and the wheel information is then displayed. The operator interface indicates the specific nut runner spindle spacing for that particular wheel, as well as other necessary information for assembly. <br />The actual final torque values for each tightening sequence are displayed on the operator interface monitor and pass/fail criteria are clearly indicated. Torque data is recorded and stored for future reference or report generation. New or updated wheel data and torque values are easily added to the system using menu-driven software procedures. The operator interface is password protected to control access to wheel configuration data.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), ATTN: Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, United States Coast Guard, 2100 2nd St SW STOP 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112; FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 

     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OFDA, in collaboration with USAID/Iraq, is responsible for providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable communities, displaced persons, and refugee and internally displaced persons (IDPs) returnees in Iraq.  The conflict and its aftermath resulted in a widespread dislocation of citizens and a breakdown of essential services.  A range of emergency needs and challenges remain in Iraq, particularly in vulnerable locations across the country which include provision of potable water, sanitation and hygiene, primary health care, livelihoods support, basic infrastructure rehabilitation, shelter and support to returning IDPs and refugees. A critical need prevails to support USAID/Iraqs effort in capacity building with ministries, specifically in the Ministry of Displacement and Migration, its local government and community programs that may provide assistance to IDPs and returnees.

While displacement has affected almost all of Iraq, sectarian tensions from 2006 to 2008 resulted in up to 1.3 million recently displaced people, along with another 1.2 million who were displaced prior to 2006, as well as up to 2 million Iraqis who fled in neighboring countries.  The practice of Iraqis providing temporary residence to IDPs has placed even more strain on host communities and their local resources.  

A major challenge in Iraqs post-conflict environment is the return and reintegration of IDPs to their areas of origin, or to a safe new resettlement location, and the provision of immediate humanitarian assistance to and reintegration of Iraqi refugees and IDPs, as well ongoing provision of assistance to vulnerable communities across the country.  

Proposed IDP Assistance Activities:  USAID/OFDA, with the support of implementing partners, delivers urgently needed assistance in all provinces of Iraq.  Though the current assistance is country wide, OFDA focuses assistance on the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities in specific locations.   The main sectors are: 

Sector 1: Water and Sanitation and Hygiene for IDP and Returnee Affected Communities.
OFDA supports activities with an emphasis on provision of potable water and sanitation with a hygiene component and within a community context wherever possible. 

Sector 2: Health for IDP and Returnee Affected Communities.
OFDA funds a variety of health related activities with an emphasis on support to the primary health care system in IDP and returnee affected areas. These activities are complemented by basic health education programs. 

Sector 3: Economy and Market Systems support for IDP and Returnee Communities
OFDA supports livelihood activities that provide immediate assistance to new caseload IDPs and returnees that include cash-for-work programs.

Sector 4: Logistics / Relief Commodities for IDPs and Returnees.
OFDA provides emergency relief commodities for the vulnerable groups. 

Sector 5: Protection for Most Vulnerable Persons.
OFDAs activities that enhance the protection of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children that are at high risk, are a high priority.

Sector 6: Shelter and Settlements.
OFDA will increase its support to activities that contribute to the successful return of IDPs and Refugees to their previous property or towards establishing new long term residences.  

Sector 7: Humanitarian Coordination and Information Management. 
Strengthening the Ministry of Migration, especially its branch offices in the provinces, is a high priority, and will be expanded in this year.

OBJECTIVE

USAID/OFDA seeks the services of a full-time Senior Program Advisor in Iraq to meet its program objectives. The incumbent will provide support to the implementing partners, liaise with senior U.S. Government (USG) and Government of Iraq officials on the programmatic implications of policy decisions, and serve as OFDAs lead representative on issues related to OFDAs programming portfolio.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Senior Program Advisor will work independently under guidance of Senior Humanitarian Advisor in Iraq and direct supervision of the Regional Coordinator in Washington, DC.  In addition, the incumbent will serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions. 

The Senior Program Advisors responsibilities will chiefly include, but not be limited to the following:

Program Management, Monitoring, and Liaison

Working with USAID/Iraq and USAID/OFDAs Senior Humanitarian Advisor, the Senior Program Advisor will:

	Serve in an advisory capacity for ongoing planning exercises for humanitarian response in Iraq; advocate USAID/OFDA positions on best humanitarian practices and provide technical expertise;
	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of the Embassy, relevant ministries, donor governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to ensure efficient and coordinated programs; 
	Serve as OFDAs primary liaison with USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, local government officials, United Nations organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other relevant agencies and organizations;
	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with varied stakeholders in order to ensure close coordination in the field, identify the appropriate partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;
	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with Coalition military forces focused on civil affairs humanitarian activities;
	Coordinate closely with other USAID personnel in Iraq in order to ensure a program that is well integrated with OFDAs and USAIDs overall objectives;
	Coordinate closely with the Regional Advisor, Regional Coordinator and Disaster Operations Specialist for Iraq in Washington;
	Manage and monitor OFDA funded activities in Iraq; recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions; 
	As and when necessary, assist OFDA/Logistics in coordinating the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA for Iraq;
	Facilitate and coordinate the site visits of additional OFDA/Washington personnel, as necessary;
	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the USAID Mission and U.S. Embassy and USG personnel, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;
	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OFDAs implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) to ensure that activities are contributing to OFDAs program objectives and are within the partners scope; 
	Ensure that OFDAs programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities.

Reporting
	Provide oral and written reporting to the USAID Mission and OFDA/Washington on all aspects of the humanitarian situation, including changing conditions, needs, and humanitarian response activities by Civil Affairs, the Iraqi government, and the humanitarian aid community in Iraq; maintain frequent telephone communication with OFDA/Washington;   
	Provide notes and other briefing materials as requested for various field-based entities;
	Be responsible for a bi-weekly programming update, drawing an input from the Senior Humanitarian Advisor and feedback from implementing partners; 
	Continually collect, verify, analyze, and update information on the general situation status, progress of relief activities, areas of concern, and maps from implementing partners and other sources.

Security
	OFDA Field Personnel will adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines; all travel will be coordinated with the USAID Mission and other relevant parties, and also be cleared with OFDA/Washington. 


SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Program Advisor will report directly to the EMCA Regional Advisor and/or EMCA Regional Coordinator or his/her designee while also working closely with the OFDA Senior Humanitarian Advisor to ensure an equitable distribution of responsibility and non-duplication of activities.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Both direct and indirect supervisors will set overall objectives. The incumbent and the supervisors together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. 

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot or spend lengthy periods of time in body armor.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).  OFDA staff serving in Iraq are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool. Walking and jogging within the compound is also an option. 

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Most work activities take place in an office setting. During visits to counterpart offices and project sites in Baghdad, trips to various governorates, as allowed by security, and/or travel to Amman and Washington, D.C., for consultation and meetings with USG and partners, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional information as provided below;

Question 1. It is unclear whether summaries of state regulations and statutes are acceptable. Do you require only summaries of state regulations and statutes, or do you require the full-text of state regulations and statutes? If full-text state regulations and statutes are required, please identify those state statutes and regulations by state and citation.

 

Response:  Summaries of State regulations and statutes pertaining to commercial vehicle safety are acceptable.  Full-text versions are not required.  For each State, this material typically would include an overview of the States adoption of the Federal safety regulations for commercial motor vehicles, and any instances in which the State regulations or statutes address topics that are not covered by the Federal regulations or are more restrictive than the Federal regulations; for example, Federal regulations do not require mud flaps on trailers, but some State statutes do.  No information is required for State commercial vehicle statutes and regulations that do not pertain directly to highway safety. 

                             

Question 2. Are full-text proposed regulations also required?  If so, does the scope of the proposed regulations need to cover all of the same regulations identified in response to question no. 1, above?

 

Response:  No full-text or summary proposed State regulations are required.  

 

Question 3. The exact scope of documents now contained in the current MCREGIS is unclear. Please identify, by category, the title and format (i.e. Text, Word, PDF, other) of each of the documents in the current MCREGIS product.

 

Response:   As indicated in the PWS, the specific documents to be included in the future MCREGIS documents section will be determined by FMCSA and will vary from time-to-time.  These include, for example, Federal Register notices regarding proposed and final Federal rules and exemptions, FMCSA policy letters and regulatory guidance, CVSA Out-of-Service Criteria, educational and technical assistance documents, tables of hazardous materials, rosters of Federal and State staff contacts, etc.  These may be in any generally-accepted format such as text, Word, pdf, etc.  Some of these documents may require modification by the vendor for  508 compliance. 


No further responses will be provided prior to the close of this solicitation on July 21, 2009 @ 1300 Local.

In addition, our senior consultant and trainer has a Ph.D. in English and has been teaching writing for over 30 years. She has taught a wide range of writing courses at a large University. Her references include the current Provost and Dean of the University...My question is, will our GSA-approval and these references suffice for your past performance requirements?
Answer #2: All information provided will be considered when evaluating proposals. 

Question #3:  Is this a new requirement? 
Answer #3: Yes

Question #4:  Do you have an incumbent?

Answer #8:  Sorry, no certificate is require.

Question #9:  Would it be possible for you to provide samples of bad writing and perhaps even bad grammar for critique during workshops? In the best of all possible worlds, the samples would come from the students and would reflect the problems that the FDA would like to have remedied. Also (in the best of all possible worlds) the samples would be in a variety of writing forms (correspondence, reports, articles, etc.) and would reflect a variety of writing errors.  
Answer #9:  No, for confidential reasons, we will not be able to provide writing samples.

Question #10:  Please clarify what you mean by The offeror's information SHALL NOT appear anywhere on or in the price or technical proposal.

If not, how do you recommend this be addressed, particularly in the biographies/resumes?  
Answer #10:  For administrative purposes, the respondants information shall only be listed on the cover page of the proposal.  Resumes are the only exception.

Question #11:  I am a small, woman-owned business that specializes in business writing instruction and services, and I am interested in responding to your RFP. However, I do not have previous contracts over $25,000. Will that rule me out of the competition, even if I do have superior customer satisfaction, etc.? To enable responses from many small businesses (including new ones without a long track record), would you considering removing the $25,000 minimum contract limit? Yes, we will consider removing the $25,000.00 minimum limit from the contract

<DESC>Question #1:  In regards to solicitation 09-223-SOL-00147, is there an incumbent or a prior contractor who performed this or a similar oral training program for FDA?
Answer #1:   We have had many classes in the pass with various contractors.

Question #2:  May we submit the 6 additional copies by mail in paper form or must it be electronically via CD?  
Answer #2:  Please submit by flash drive, hardcopies or burned CD.

Question #3:  In Factor # 3: Past Performance, the solicitation states that offerors must submit information on the last 3 contracts (minimum of $25.000 each). Does this mean that contracts for an amount less than $25,000 are not accepted? Yes This would seem to mean that only those businesses whose contracts are for $25,000. or more are eligible for this contract. Only one of our examples of Past Performance was a contract for over $25,000. We have several examples of past performance of the type requested in this solicitation that were for amounts less than $25,000.    
Answer #3:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FACTOR HAS BEEN CHANGED TO THE FOLLOWING:  "Offeror's shall submit a list and description of the last three contractscompleted during the past three years.  Offeror's shall be evaluated on (1) record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; (2) adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; and (3) reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction."

Answer #4:  Yes

Question #5:  To clarify: for this solicitation all of the trainings are for participants with English as second language correct?  
Answer #5:  No, these training are for our entire staff who desire to take the training, but we have a large number for staff for whom English is a second language.

<DESC>RECOVERY--RECOVERY--Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for projects to explore the further development of efficient, high temperature SiC power electronics to be used in military vehicles that encompass hybrid electric mobility and power generation systems. The government desires SiC power electronics that can operate with coolant inlet temperatures at 100C or higher. Increased coolant temperatures increase cooling efficiency and allow for reduced cooling system size. The power electronics developed must use the SiC power semiconductors to maximize efficiency, power density (kW/liter) and specific power (kW/kg), while maintaining or improving power converter reliability. The corresponding reductions in size and weight for the cooling system and the electrical power converter, along with increased cooling efficiency and power conversion efficiency will make vehicle electric and hybrid electric power systems smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient.<BR><BR>Estimated Maximum Government funding available for Topic #20 is $12.15M. The Government reserves the right to award part or all of an offerors proposal resulting in one or multiple contracts (for various amounts, but the sum of multiple contract awards shall not exceed $12.15M) that may address one or more or all of the Power Converter Types listed in the attachment at subparagraph 2.b of the Description section.<BR><BR>The topic was amended on 08 Jun 2009 to include footnotes to the Power Converter Types to provide additional details. The topic was amended again on 29 Jun 2009 to extend the proposal due date to 24 Jul 2009. The topic was also amended on 14 Jul 2009 to provide additional proposal submission instructions and specific Recovery Act clauses applicable to any resultant contracts.<BR><BR>Potential offerors should access the full topic description by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following URL:<BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/topics.htm <BR><BR>Solicitation terms and conditions and proposal submission instructions for this Broad Agency Announcement can be accessed by copying and pasting the following URL:<BR>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm<BR><BR>Special Proposal Instructions:<BR>All proposals must be received by 3:00 PM local time on July 24, 2009 using the ASFI Bid Response System (BRS), which may be accessed at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations that seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.

The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

WORKSHOP DATE: July 31, 2009; 
REGISTRATION DEADLINE: July 14, 2009;

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research to enable revolutionary advances for the rapid development and demonstration of lightweight, high-performance multi-material rotors  for current and future US Navy Submarine applications.  The ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate multi-physics performance prediction tools and multi-material manufacturing processes that can be successfully transitioned to the US Navy to improve performance and reduce weight and development costs of current and next-generation submarine rotors.  A large percentage of the acquisition cost of legacy US Navy submarine rotors is associated with non-recurring design, analysis, test, and evaluation iterations required to demonstrate the rotors performance.  These rotors are designed to simultaneously address multiple demanding maritime operational environment requirements using proprietary, uncoupled special-purpose domain codes (e.g., structural and hydrodynamic codes).  The current uncoupled nature of these legacy tool-sets is considered to be an impediment to shortening the rotor design cycle due to their inability to rapidly and accurately predict rotor off-design  performance (e.g., during standard maneuvers, crash-back, backing, and crash-ahead operations).  

Legacy US Navy submarine rotors are manufactured from Nickel-Aluminum-Bronze (NAB).  Although NAB material properties are well-understood, the dynamic performance and weight of NAB rotors are dictated by the rotor geometry.  Tailored multi-material (both organic and inorganic) systems offer the opportunity to provide improved dynamic performance and weight reduction unachievable with NAB.  However, transformational improvements in rotor design, analysis, and multi-material manufacturing methods are needed to exploit the potential benefits of multi-material rotors.  

The Hybrid Multi-Materials Rotor Workshop will be held at the Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd, Suite 300, Arlington, VA, 22201. There is no registration fee.  Details on the workshop, including registration and clearance submission information, can be found at the following URL: www.sa-meetings.com/HMMR2009.  The password for login is: Submarines.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is July 14, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted to add participants on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

Further questions about the workshop should be directed to DARPA-SN-09-47@darpa.mil.  Please refer to the HMMR Workshop in any correspondence.  

This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned. Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.

<p>Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing power-efficient and remotable high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with high resolution. The proposed program (Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converters with De-serialization and Reconstruction or RADER) research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in analog-to-digital conversion. ADC systems enabled by RADER technology will be capable of operating in continuous time over a 10 GHz input instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution of 10 effective number of bits (ENOB). Ultimately, it is desirable to be able to place the 10 GHz IBW so that input signals with frequency content of up to 18 GHz are captured. However, RADER technology demonstrations will focus on 10 GHz IBW at baseband (all Phases) in addition to 6 GHz IBW centered at 15 GHz (Phase III). Of particular interest is achieving these impressive goals within a dense input signal environment while simultaneously limiting the amount of dc power consumed to less than 50 Watts. Furthermore, in most applications, it is advantageous to sense analog waveforms at a point remoted from the components or subsystems that require significant portions of the power budget. The realization of such a continuous time analog-to-digital (A/D) system would create a unique new capability beyond the range of existing ADCs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 
All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-51@darpa.mil. See full BAA document attached.</p>

Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-47: Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor (HMMR) Workshop; 
WORKSHOP DATE: July 31, 2009; 
REGISTRATION DEADLINE: July 24, 2009;

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research to enable revolutionary advances for the rapid development and demonstration of lightweight, high-performance multi-material rotors  for current and future US Navy Submarine applications.  The ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate multi-physics performance prediction tools and multi-material manufacturing processes that can be successfully transitioned to the US Navy to improve performance and reduce weight and development costs of current and next-generation submarine rotors.  A large percentage of the acquisition cost of legacy US Navy submarine rotors is associated with non-recurring design, analysis, test, and evaluation iterations required to demonstrate the rotors performance.  These rotors are designed to simultaneously address multiple demanding maritime operational environment requirements using proprietary, uncoupled special-purpose domain codes (e.g., structural and hydrodynamic codes).  The current uncoupled nature of these legacy tool-sets is considered to be an impediment to shortening the rotor design cycle due to their inability to rapidly and accurately predict rotor off-design  performance (e.g., during standard maneuvers, crash-back, backing, and crash-ahead operations).  

Legacy US Navy submarine rotors are manufactured from Nickel-Aluminum-Bronze (NAB).  Although NAB material properties are well-understood, the dynamic performance and weight of NAB rotors are dictated by the rotor geometry.  Tailored multi-material (both organic and inorganic) systems offer the opportunity to provide improved dynamic performance and weight reduction unachievable with NAB.  However, transformational improvements in rotor design, analysis, and multi-material manufacturing methods are needed to exploit the potential benefits of multi-material rotors.  

The Hybrid Multi-Materials Rotor Workshop will be held at the Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Blvd, Suite 300, Arlington, VA, 22201. There is no registration fee.  Details on the workshop, including registration and clearance submission information, can be found at the following URL: www.sa-meetings.com/HMMR2009.  The password for login is: Submarines.

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is July 14, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted to add participants on a first-come, first-serve basis. 

Further questions about the workshop should be directed to DARPA-SN-09-47@darpa.mil.  Please refer to the HMMR Workshop in any correspondence.  

This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned. Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.

The equipment listed has been identified as key components of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.  To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the Line Cards and Modules must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/ITI Special Projects has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as key components of the Departments networking system.

EVALUATION FACTORS
Potential Contractors shall be evaluated in terms of the factors/criteria identified below.  Submissions will be evaluated against the evaluation factors as they relate to the requirements of the solicitation, as well as evaluated for meeting mandatory responsibility criteria per FAR Subpart 9.1.  A detailed evaluation will be made of the submissions.  Submissions must demonstrate a thorough understanding of and the capability to accomplish the overall requirements as stated in the following evaluation factors. Firms will be evaluated on the following factors listed in descending order of importance: 

Evaluation Factor 1  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence 
The Board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities of the prime offeror and any subcontractors.  The Board will examine the effectiveness of the proposed project team to ensure the Offerors ability to coordinate the needs of several of the Governments key partners. This will include evaluating the management structure; coordination of disciplines; offices and/or subcontractors; and the prior working relationships between team members. Also to be reviewed is how successful the offeror is in integrating the needs of multiple clients/partners.  The Board will evaluate submissions to determine if a history of successful execution of designs for public administrative and recreation facilities, including Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities in environmentally sensitive settings can be demonstrated. Specifically the Board will evaluate offerors/teams experience with:  (a) Sustainable design; (b) Previous LEED-certified designs and projects; (c) Recreational design specifically addressing needs of multicultural communities; (d) Managing projects with natural resource agencies corporate cultures; (e) Designing interior/exterior spaces that effectively gather, engage and inspire people to interact and learn together; (f) Land planning of recreational day use areas and other public gathering and discovery spaces as well as Visitor Orientation and Learning facilities; (g) Producing designs for unique and sensitive environments which are integrated into the environment; and, (h) Energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  Provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for those projects profiled under this category.  A minimum of five projects are desired and no more than ten will be reviewed. Include a representative floor plan, site plan, building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project.

The Board will examine and note the offerors organizational structure, approach and philosophy regarding construction management of small to medium construction projects (e.g. $100,000 to 50 million) with complex demands.  The Board will examine the offerors experience with design and/or construction management projects where community members, fundraising specialists/donors/board member, non profits, and/or diverse stakeholders had meaningful involvement in the process.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  

The Board will examine the offerors ability to produce notable and distinctive architecture while working within a design guideline framework.  Please provide the specific project name, construction cost, point of contact, phone number, email and key personnel for two projects under this category.  Include at least two photographs for each project.  The Board will investigate AutoCAD and design presentation software capabilities.  Responses should include software name, version and number and/or names of skilled operators on the team.  The Board will evaluate the scope of experience with the types of work and disciplines noted in the attached Statement of Work Document.

Evaluation Factor 2  Proximity Factor 
The Board shall consider the geographic proximity for coordination and communication with key Forest Service staff, and the offerors knowledge of locality.  It is expected that the majority of the work under this solicitation will be for the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA), Las Vegas.  The remaining work load may include locations throughout the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Consequently, a geographic location preference will be given for Las Vegas, Nevada and surrounding area (50 mile radius).  Scoring for the proximity factor will apply to office/key personnel locations for the lead architect-engineer firm and the construction management firm.  Other consultants that are part of the offerors team which would have an incidental role in meeting contract requirements (e.g., interpretative exhibit design, specialty technical experts, etc.) may be located outside of the geographic area without affecting the proximity score. 

The offeror should demonstrate knowledge of geological features (e.g. desert and mountain environments) climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique to the Las Vegas area and experience with local government organizations, regulations, laws and unique criteria associated with the construction climate in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The offeror should demonstrate general knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are typical to National Forest locations within the remainder of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

Evaluation Factor 3  Professional Qualifications 
The Selection Board will evaluate the education, training, registrations, professional certificates, awards, peer recognition, overall and relevant experience, and longevity of the key management and personnel with the offeror:  The Board will consider the level of education of the staff in the disciplines needed to successfully complete the work.  The Board will consider the availability of professionals with appropriate training in specialized subjects such as energy savings and energy modeling, building inspection services, new technologies and systems, environmentally sensitive design, construction techniques appropriate for the setting/locations, development of infrastructure and recreational sites, etc., as appropriate to support the development of the work of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and other National Forest locations within the Intermountain Region.  The Board will consider the offerors depth and breadth of staff with LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) Accreditation as defined by the US Green Building Council.  The Board will consider the depth and disciplines on staff who are professionally registered Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors, etc. The designers or project managers in each discipline and surveyors must be registered in the state(s) services are proposed.  The Board will consider overall and relevant experience.  Relevant experience includes A-E work typical with that encountered in the Forest Service (e.g., visitor centers, interpretative and education facilities, campgrounds, play spaces, administrative offices, etc.) and A-E experience with federal land management agencies.  The Board will consider the longevity of key staff involved with the offeror and the offerors subcontractors, indicative of the stability and continuity of each offerors practice.

Evaluation Factor 4  Past Performance  
The Board will evaluate the past performance on design services and construction management on contracts of similar size and scope.  The Board will examine the documented past performance of the Offeror and Subcontractors in the Governments PPIRS site, (The Past Performance Information Retrieval System) a government database for Civilian Agencies.  The Board will evaluate the design quality, timeliness and cost controls implemented in projects of similar size (e.g. $100,000 to $50 million) and scope (described in Factor 2) in the public and/or private sector.  Provide a list of four projects with the project name, description, award price, final price, client name and contact information.  Include similar information on construction management projects.  The Board will examine the trend of repeat business with clients, which suggests strong long-term relationships. Please provide the specific project name, point of contact, phone number, email for three past clients to verify successful performance of the proposed Offeror.  The Board will compare the list of personnel involved in successful projects with the proposed team for the contract.  The availability of successful professionals with proven track records will be a key factor in the selection of a submission.

Evaluation Factor 5  Capacity to Accomplish the Work 
Provide a brief narrative regarding the size of the firms (prime and subcontractors), current workload (number of projects and dollar value), and ability to absorb additional work.  The Board will consider an offeror's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a offeror to perform the work. The board will consider the full potential value of any current contracts that a offeror has been awarded when evaluating capacity.  The Board will evaluate evidence of the success of long term relationships between the offerors proposed team (prime and subconsultants) which suggests the ability to work together and accomplish successful projects. An exhibit illustrating past projects where the multiple firms of the offerors team have worked together should be submitted to assist the agency in understanding this element. 

Evaluation Factor 6  Oral Interview 
Oral interviews will be required in the second stage of evaluations for the short-listed firms notified by the government.  This factor is included in this synopsis for information only and is not to be included in the submissions to this synopsis posting.  Interviews will be conducted with the offerors determined to be the most qualified based on evaluation of SF-330s and Evaluation Factors 1-5.  Interviews will be conducted with a minimum of three offerors and no more than six offerors.  Interviews will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will last no longer than two hours.  Offerors should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation factors and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  The key project staff from the offerors team (prime and subconsultants) should attend the interview, up to ten persons.  Emphasis will be placed on the lead designer/engineer-A/E teams understanding of the unique aspects of the SMNRA Middle Kyle Complex project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance processes.

<DESC>The requirement previously synopsized under M67004-09-R-0011 is still
awaiting required approvals of all acquisition planning documents.  Until
these approvals are obtained the solicitation will not be released.  The
contracting officer anticipates that approvals may take up to 60 additional
days, resulting in a solicitation the first week of September, however this
date could slide in either direction.  
The contracting officer intends to host a pre-solicitation conference in
Albany, Georgia just prior to releasing the solicitation.  Notice will be
posted here and via direct contact with anyone who has previously expressed
interest in this program at least 21 days in advance to allow for travel
arrangements.  Attendance will not be mandatory, and all information
provided at the conference by the Government will be posted publically.
In addition, this modification deletes the classification code previously posted under the synopsis and replaces it with classification code J-Maintenance, Repair, and Rebuilding of Equipment.  No responses to this synopsis amendment are required or desired.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Recovery Act - Synopsis of DOE Contract Award Action </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Contract Modification 020 obligates American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to the Tank Operations Contract (TOC), contract number DE-AC27-08RV14800.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The original scope and purpose of the contract will not change with the addition of the ARRA Stimulus Funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Total Contract Price will not increase as a result of this modification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span>The TOC Contract is a $7.1B performance-based cost plus award fee contract with specific performance-based incentives awarded to Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) May 29, 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the contract is to furnish safe, compliant, cost-effective and energy-efficient services to further the Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP) mission to store, retrieve and treat Hanford tank waste, store and dispose of treated waste, and to close the Tank Farm waste management areas to protect the Columbia River.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">&nbsp;Modification 020 <span style="color: #000000;">obligates ARRA funding in the amount of $188.4 million dollars to </span>meet the original contract funding profile and accelerate work that was contemplated in the five-year (5) base period and first option period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The specific period of performance is as follows:</p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">&nbsp;Base Period: October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2013,</p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">Option Period 1:&nbsp;October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2016,</p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">Option Period 2:&nbsp;October 1, 2016 through September 2018<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">Modification 020 also revised Sections B, C, G and J-15 to clarify the ARRA funded projects and milestones to be executed during the base contract period of performance.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Contract Clause I.103, FAR 52.243-2 Changes - Cost Reimbursement (AUG 1987), ALT II (APR 1984), ALT III (APR 1984), ALT IV (APR 1984) of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the contract. </span></p>
<p>The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract and specifically identified in Sub-CLIN 1.2, Safe, and Compliant Operations, Sub-CLIN 1.3, Analytical Laboratory Support, and Sub-CLIN 3.1, Treatment Planning, Waste Feed Delivery, and WTP Transition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors were provided ample opportunity to propose to this specific scope of work during the initial TOC competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only was this work specifically identified in the TOC SOW, but also in the WBS Dictionary sheets and within Section J, Attachment J. 11 Supplemental Work Description Tables provided to Offerors during the TOC solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors were further put on notice via Section B.14, DOE Authorization of Work, that the ORP reserved the right to "turn work on/off" as funding was made available through the contract period of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: .25in">&nbsp;The prospects for performing the TOC scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior to the recent TOC competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to being FFP. This, coupled with the fact that the work scope has already been defined, competed, and awarded under the TOC, a Cost Plus contract with Performance-Based Incentives, FFP efforts at the prime level are not possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ORP has communicated to the TOC contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.</p>

<DESC>Work required to stabilize these areas includes reshaping vertical banks to allow vegetative recovery, and machine placement of rock in drainages to prevent additional scour from seasonal flows. Specific work items include excavation in meadows often requiring conservation of topsoil, and preserving and re-planting living sod of perennial grasses. Excavation will also take place in steep and eroded ephemeral channels and existing gullies requiring trenching and mechanical placement of rocks and boulders. Work will also entail placement of erosion control blanket and rolled erosion control products to enhance vegetation establishment and survivability on slopes and in channels. Erosion control design requirements may include below grade placement of geotextile products as a permeable separator/stabilizer, to prevent piping of soil beneath new or existing structures.
(b)	Project location. 
Various locations on the Mountaintop Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN AWARDED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).  

This award notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FAR Subpart 5.705.  

Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 69225 was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on July 10, 2009 in the amount of $455,379.00.  The period of performance is July 10, 2009 through December 11, 2009.

Work under this task order is follow-on work to a task order awarded competitively in July of 2008 and completed in October 2008 to develop a concept design to upgrade the thermal shield cooling system. Work required under task order 69225 will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system.  

The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii), this task order is being awarded on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>200-2009-F-30612
<DESC><p><br />1. Identification of Agency, Contracting Activity and Identification of Project:
<p>a. Program Office and Address:</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness (OSEP)<br />1600 Clifton Road, NE<br />Atlanta, GA 30333</p>
<p>b. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />Procurement and Grants Office (PGO)<br />2920 Brandywine Road, Koger Office Park<br />Atlanta, GA 30341</p>
<p>c. Identification of Requirement:<br /><br />IDAS Technical Advisory and Support Services to the CDC/OSEP in maintaining the operational integrity of the IDAS at the CDC for the period 24 Sep 09 thru 23 Sep 10.</p>
<p>2. Detailed Description of the Services</p>
<p>a. Definitions:</p>
<p>The Intrusion Detection and Assessment System is an integrated system comprised of a closed circuit television system (CCTV), digital video recorder system (DVRS) with integral video motion detection (VMD) systems, and a Johnson Controls Pegasys 2000 access control system (CARDKEY). The IDAS functions to organize and present video, <br />text, and event information to security operators in an effort to assist them in assessing and dispositioning potential threats to CDC facilities and assets.</p>
<p>The Pegasys 2000 (P2000) Access Control System is a proprietary access control system utilized to control and record access to sensitive areas. It provides alarm functions for access abnormalities. It serves as the primary logic engine and operator interface for the IDAS.</p>
<p>42 CFR Part 73, The Possession, Use, and Transfer of Selects Agents and Toxins; Interim Final Rule requires compliance with respect to the development and implementation of security and documentation plans in accordance with paragraphs 73.11 and 73.15. As a result of these requirements, the CDC is required to establish procedures for routine maintenance and repairs; control the compromise of keys, passwords, combinations, etc.; provide for the control of access to select agent areas and repositories, and maintain records of access to select agent areas and repositories.</p>
<p>HSPD-12/FIPS-201 requires compliance with respect to standardization and interoperability of personal identity verification, logical access control, and physical access control. As a result of these requirements, the CDC/OSEP is implementing an agency wide physical access control system that will allow interoperability of Cardkeys for all CDC facilities nation wide and facilitate immediate nationwide response to security events.</p>
<p>b. Description of Work:</p>
<p>Provide two technicians to assist CDC/OSEP in maintaining the operational integrity of the CDC P2000 Enterprise System and CDC Atlanta Intrusion detection and Assessment System for a period of 52 weeks. The labor provided in this contract may be used for troubleshooting, repair and modification of equipment, programming and configuration, preparation of documentation, system design, and instruction of personnel and of the various subsystems and components of the IDAS.</p>
<p>c. Estimated Value of Contract:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Identification of Justification Rationale</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(2), the new work is a logical follow-on to an existing Federal Supply Schedule order (Delivery Order No. 200-2008-F-25220), which issued under limited source procedures. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.</p>
<p>4. Rationale to Support Exception Selected Above</p>
<p>Only one responsible source is capable of responding due to the unique nature of the work. Award to any other source may result in the following: unacceptable risk to the CDC's critical facilities and to its 42 CFR 73 and HSPD 12 compliance efforts and substantial inefficiencies to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />The CDC's IDAS and P2000 Cardkey access control system are extremely complex systems. While the basic P2000 application software is the same as any P2000 Cardkey system, the custom API configuration and Microsoft Active Directory Network Environment are massively complex. Any IDAS or P2000 modification requires administrative / programming access to the P2000 Cardkey application software. Allowing system programming by those not specifically qualified, trained and experienced with the specific CDC system configurations would jeopardize the integrity, functioning, and reliability of the system.</p>
<p>The IDAS and it subsystems are an integral part of CDC's 42 CFR 73 and HSPD-12 compliance programs. The potential damage to the system caused by improper functioning of a third party's work clearly places CDC's most sensitive programs at risk.</p>
<p>Award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the CDC's requirements. Contractor personnel requiring IDAS and P2000 system administrative / programming rights must have both SECRET clearances by a CDC issued DD Form 254 and DOJ select agent clearance with assignment to a CDC 4B package. The DOJ clearance process takes 12 to 16 weeks. Obtaining a SECRET clearance takes upwards of six months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, disclosure of the Government's needs may result in the following: Information being released regarding the CDC's system and procedures for the control of access to and protection of Select Agent laboratories and Select Agent repositories; a potential compromise of CDC's systems for the control of access to and the protection of Select Agents, and unacceptable risk to the CDC's access control system and to its Select Agent compliance efforts.</p>
<p>5. Market Research</p>
<p>OSEP management has determined it not in the best interests of the Government to release the CDC's access control system architecture and incidental laboratory related information with respect to select agents to several potential contractors. Release to potential contractors would be required for the completion of a competitive bidding process. The uncontrolled dissemination of such select agent related information is deemed to be an unacceptable vulnerability that could potentially damage national security and jeopardize the objectives set forth for the CDC's security posture with respect to Select Agents, and other critical public health work.</p>
<p>6. Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition for Subsequent Acquisitions of this type</p>
<p>b. Other sources can provide and install security system components manufactured or OEMed by Johnson Controls, Inc. However, none can provide the required programming of the P2000 server or integrate with the current systems currently in service with the CDC.</p>
<p>Award to a new contractor for these services would necessitate duplication of cost relating to the installation of non-compatible components as duplication of the entire fault tolerant head end system and CDC enterprise system would be required. Additionally, CDC would incur significant costs and inefficiencies related to operation and maintenance of a duplicate system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />7. SIGNATURES ARE REQUIRED BELOW:</p>
<p>I have reviewed this Limited Source Justification and certify that the justification is accurate <br />and complete.</p>
<p><br />___________________________________ Date: ___________________<br />Project Officer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>___________________________________ Date: ___________________<br />Project Officer's Supervisor</p>
<p><br />8. Best Value Decision Statement: The contractor's proposed pricing is approximately ____% off its list price. Also, pricing represents 2 technicians versus the previous procurement which required 1.5 technicians. Pricing offered represents best value to the Government and <br />results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:<br />I hereby certify that the information contained herein is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
