<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
LIMITED SOURCES AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 8.405-6(B)(1)
ORDER >$3,000

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in paragraph #3 below is a sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.405-1 Federal Supply Schedules is precluded for the reasons indicated below.

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 
                                         	Veterans Health Administration
     	Strategic Acquisition Center
     	10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408
     
2.  Description of Action: 
The proposed action is for an award of a sole source firm fixed-price purchase order to Johnson and Johnson Healthcare/Advanced Sterilization Products for the procurement of two gas plasma (Sterrad) sterilizers 100NX and one Sterrad NX with stand for the Atlanta Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Due to the growing workload demand for endoscopic cases utilizing camera and light cords, the increase in the number endoscopic procedures requiring low temperature sterilization, the Atlanta Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) are requiring more Sterrad sterilization capabilities. To meet the demand, we are using high level disinfection to meet our endoscopic demands which does not meet sterilization standards. By purchasing these gas plasma sterilizers, the Atlanta VAMC will be able sterilize more equipment thereby decreasing the number of high level disinfection loads.  This effort is proposed to be awarded under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract V797P-4096B for Johnson and Johnson Healthcare in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(b)(1) Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.
  
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:
a. Atlanta VAMC has a need for two gas plasma (Sterrad) sterilizers 100NX and one Sterrad NX, with stand. By purchasing these gas plasma sterilizers, the Atlanta VAMC will be better equipped to sterilize more equipment thereby decreasing the number of high level disinfection loads currently being experienced by the VAMC.

b The estimated dollar value: $196,577.70     

c  The required delivery date: To be negotiated based upon the SPS renovation  	

4.  Authority: The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The statutory authority permitting this limited source action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(b)(1), Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.

5.  Rationale for Authority Cited:  The proposed source is Advanced Sterilization Product (ASP) c/o Johnson and Johnson Healthcare Systems, Inc., 425 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08855.  Based on market research, as described in paragraph 4 of this document, it was determined that only Johnson and Johnson Healthcare Systems, sterrad sterilization equipment can meet the VA's requirement and that Johnson and Johnson Healthcare System, Inc., is the only capable source. ASP is the original equipment manufacturer and the only authorized seller. ASP is the sole exclusive seller of J&J Sterrad Products.
a. Sterrad is a Gas Plasma system that provides items that are sterilized and ready for immediate use. Other sterilant systems only provide high level disinfection. Sterrad has the Cycle sure capability for providing biological indicator which provides evidence of proper sterilization. It has been specked in the new plans and able to meet the footprint of the limited space available.

b. The current gas plasma sterilizers at the Atlanta VAMC are Sterrad equipment. The new sterilizers are needed to support the increased workload demands. These items are specked in the new plans and able to meet the footprint that fits in the limited space allowed.

c. These are for existing equipment.

d. Currently, we have all Sterrad sterilizers for those heat sensitive items requiring sterilization. This provides a standardization of reprocessing equipment promoting repeatable, sustainable, and reliable outcomes.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  VA conducted market research, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  None of these efforts yielded additional sources capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements. In accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6(b)(1) the limited sole source justification will be posted on e-Buy.    
7. Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered. 
8.  Market Research: A search was done on GSA Advantage/VA Advantage, SAMs, VA FSS Schedule 65 II A 89, SBA and Vetbiz Search Tool, using the manufacturer ASP c/o Johnson and Johnson Healthcare System, Inc., no other companies came up in the search database that were capable of meeting the requirement besides ASP c/o J&J Inc. 
Market research also revealed that ASP c/o J&J, Inc. is the only manufacturer and authorized seller of Sterrad Sterilization equipment. Based on this market research, only J&J Sterrad Sterilization products can meet all of VA's requirements for upgrading of the existing operating system at Atlanta VAMC and only ASP is authorized to sell the Sterrad Sterilization equipment.    
This item has been evaluated to support the current and future RME processing needs. It further meets the space requirements and provides limited resource requirements for installation as it is the same vendor. This will limit the number of service calls as one vendor can provide oversight of the present and new equipment. Staff is currently competent in the use of the current vendor's equipment resulting in reduced down time for training. 

9.  Other Facts:  IAW FAR 8.404 (d), "Veterans Affairs has already determined that prices under VA FSS schedule contracts are fair and reasonable". All of the products requested are available on VA FSS Schedule. The Ordering Contracting Officer will seek additional price discounts and conduct a price analysis using historical pricing data.     
10. Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

11.  Determination of Best Value:  I hereby determine that the proposed contract action will represent the best value to the Government. VA has already determined that the prices on the FSS contract are fair and reasonable.  Further price analysis will be conducted and subsequent negotiations held as necessary.  Additionally, price discounts will be sought.
