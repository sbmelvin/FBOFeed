<DESC><p><br />Anticipate release of Final Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 26&nbsp;December 2013 with a closing date on or around&nbsp;10 February 2014.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force (USAF) Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio, is announcing its intent to solicit proposals under Request For Proposal (RFP) FA8056-14-R-0001. This solicitation will serve to acquire Roof Repair and Replacement for all Active Duty USAF Installations within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), including facilities managed under Joint Basing agreements where the USAF is the lead agent.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this solicitation is 238160, Roofing Contractors. The business size standard in dollars is $14M.</p>
<p>As stated in the Draft RFP (FA8056-13-R-0002), this acquisition is a total small business set-aside with awards carved out for 8(a) firms. The Government anticipates awarding Regional Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These regions include the following facilities, which may include various ranges.</p>
<p>West: California (Beale AFB, Edwards AFB, Los Angeles AFB, Travis AFB, Vandenberg AFB), Colorado (Buckley AFB, Cheyenne Mountain AFS, Peterson AFB, Schriever AFB, United States Air Force Academy), Idaho (Mountain Home AFB), Montana (Malmstrom AFB), Nevada (Creech AFB, Nellis AFB, Tonopah Test Range), Utah (Hill AFB &amp; Test Ranges), Washington (Fairchild AFB), and Wyoming (F.E. Warren AFB).</p>
<p>Midwest: Illinois (Scott AFB), Kansas (McConnell AFB), Missouri (Whiteman AFB), Nebraska (Offutt AFB), North Dakota (Cavalier AFS, Grand Forks AFB, and Minot AFB), and South Dakota (Ellsworth AFB).</p>
<p>Northeast: Delaware (Dover AFB), Maryland (Joint Base Andrews), Massachusetts (Cape Cod AFS and Hanscom AFB), New Hampshire, (New Boston AFS), New Jersey (Joint Base McGuire), New York (Rome Labs), Ohio (Wright-Patterson AFB), and Virginia (Joint Base Langley).</p>
<p>Southwest: Arizona (Davis-Monthan AFB, Luke AFB &amp; Ranges), New Mexico (Cannon AFB, Holloman AFB and Kirtland AFB), Oklahoma (Altus AFB, Tinker AFB and Vance AFB), and Texas (Dyess AFB, Goodfellow AFB, Joint Base San Antonio (includes Lackland AFB, Randolph AFB and Fort Sam Houston) Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB).</p>
<p>Southeast: Alabama (Maxwell-Gunter AFB), Arkansas (Little Rock AFB), Florida (Avon Park AFR, Cape Canaveral AFS, Eglin AFB, Hurlburt AFB, MacDill AFB, Patrick AFB, and Tyndall AFB), Georgia (Moody AFB and Robins AFB), Louisiana (Barksdale AFB), Mississippi (Columbus AFB and Kessler AFB), North Carolina (Seymour-Johnson AFB), South Carolina (Joint Base Charleston and Shaw AFB &amp; Ranges) and Tennessee (Arnold AFB).</p>
<p>Offerors may propose and win IDIQ Contracts in a maximum of two (2) regions, and should expect to submit separate, complete proposals for each region. The contract awards will be for one (1) base year and up to four (4) option years.</p>
<p>The USAF intends to award a target of thirty-two (32) multiple-award IDIQ contracts which will be divided between the five (5) geographic regions. The total contract value is approximately $220M with a ceiling of approximately $325M. Twenty four (24) contractors will receive Effective Awards and be immediately available to compete for task orders. A target of eight (8) additional contractors will receive On-Ramp Awards and be eligible to compete for task orders if the USAF determines that additional capacity is needed in any of the five geographic regions.</p>
<p>Please note that there have been several changes since the Draft RFP release in April 2013. These changes include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Removed requirement for state licensing as part of the technical proposal since not all U.S. states levy this requirement<br />&bull; Removed requirement for the 5 year bonded general contractor construction warranty for roof replacement projects<br />&bull; Added a Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRL) item for annual reporting<br />&bull; Deleted the Technical_Proposal_Narrative_Attachment.docx to simplify proposal submittals<br />&bull; Added contract clauses to allow bases to further set-aside task order projects</p>
<p>When the Final RFP is released, all potential offerors should carefully review the instructions in Section L as well as the evaluation criteria described in Section M of the Solicitation. AFICA will award contracts in accordance with the evaluation procedures established in the Final RFP.<br />All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>The USAF is not responsible for notifying any interested parties of the upcoming solicitation beyond this notice. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the official government point of entry, <a href="http://WWW.FBO.GOV">HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV</a>,&nbsp; for further updates and instructions.</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Solicitation No. W15P7T-13-R-5005, which serves as a notification to industry of procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms.  SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments, although a four-channel system may be considered.  SANR will replace the current Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability, and provide new Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability offering voice and data networking capability and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms.  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products. <br>  <br> The anticipated date for release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 18 October 2013.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the draft RFP, and subsequently for the formal RFP, will be posted with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, two Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One-Year base period and four (4) One-Year option periods.  After contract award, the Government intends to subsequently make a down-select to a single contractor for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SANR systems, spares, and associated support.  The Government will reserve the right to exercise LRIP and FRP quantities of SANR systems, spares, and associated support under both contracts if it is determined to be in its best interest. <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to award the two contracts in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process.   <br>  <br> Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. <br>  <br> The above discussed intent is subject to change.  <br>  <br> If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV. <br>  <br> The response date indicated on this synopsis does not require a response from industry.  DO NOT submit any documentation / proposals / letters of any kind in response to this synopsis. <br>  <br> Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted. <br>  <br> All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email address identified above. Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above. Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>

<a href="mailto:robbin.m.kessler@nasa.gov">Robbin  Kessler</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) intends to extend the period of performance for the current Research Facilities and Enginering Support Services (RF&ESS) Contract, NAS4-00047, with Arcata and Associates. The extension will be for six (6) months, from February 1, 2014 through July 31, 2014, with two (2) 3-month option periods, August 1, 2014 through October 31, 2014, and November 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015, respectively, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and an approved Deviation of FAR 17.204(e). &lt;p&gt; A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before January 31, 2014, which is the expiration of the current RF&ESS contract. Contract NAS4-00047, a cost plus award fee contract, was awarded on July 3, 2002, as a result of full and open competition to Arcata and Associates. This extension is necessary to bridge the performance period between the end of the current contract and award of a new NASA DFRC RF&ESS contract. &lt;p&gt; Services received under this contract are critical to mission operations of NASA DFRC. The services provided include services and/or support for the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), Research Aircraft Integration Facility (RAIF), and Information Technology (IT) Information Support Services (ISS). &lt;p&gt; *WATR sustaining and developmental engineering and operations services, including telemetry/radar acquisition and processing (TRAPS) hardware and software, range display systems, real-time hardware and software processing, tracking and mobile systems, and communications and video control center *RAIF sustaining and developmental engineering and operations, including simulation hardware design and integration, systems engineering and facility integration, and simulation project support to Remotely Augmented Vehicles (RAV) and Remotely Piloted Research Vehicles (RPRV) *ISS, including Chief Information Office (CIO) and IT security support, central computer systems services, database analysis, programming support and web development, phone operations, cable plant services and help desk and scheduling services. IT management and operations includes systems engineering and protective services information systems. Multimedia systems support, includes audio and video technical support, imaging services, administrative and in-flight photography and video, and graphics and illustration services. &lt;p&gt; The current contract, Arcata and Associates, is considered the only contractor that can meet DFRC's needs given the potentially short period of performance for the extension. The contractor has the experienced and skilled personnel already in place to provide continued and uninterrupted RF&ESS services at DFRC. Award to another source for the period of this extension would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition of the extension and would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. PDT on January 4, 2014. Such determination of capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is Mr. Patrick C. Stoliker, 661-276-2076 or patrick.c.stoliker@nasa.gov. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 1500 employees, respectively.

<RESPDATE>122613
<CONTACT>Patrick Smith, Phone 7323237754, Email patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, on a non-competitive basis, with AirScan LLC (AirScan) of Titusville, FL 32780 for the procurement of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operator support services for Copperhead detachments in Afghanistan. The Government intends to procure the below items under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Copperhead detachments are necessary to augment Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) operations and ultimately reduce the threat to an increasing volume of convoy traffic in Afghanistan. This effort is for the sustainment and continuity of Copperhead, a priority 02 C-IED platform in connection with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) mission supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Copperhead uses multiple NAVAIR Tigershark Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) deployed as a squadron equipped with the Sandia National Laboratories-developed SAR to accomplish the C-IED mission. Specialized radar operators are required to interpret and analyze Micro-SAR imagery at Copperhead detachments in Afghanistan. This effort requires AirScan to provide SAR radar operators, analysts and mission commanders possessing unique skills and abilities to analyze and interpret the Micro-SAR imagery on a UAV platform at remote deployed sites in Afghanistan. AirScan radar operators and anaylsts will initialize, operate, and perform command uploads to the SAR; monitor SAR operation and assess SAR system health; interpret extremely high-resolution (finer than 6-inch) stripmap SAR imagery real time; and analyze change detection data and provide analysis results.</p>
<p>SAR operator support services are critical to force protection by providing declarations for IEDs, which protect our deployed forces in Afghanistan. Micro-SAR imagery interpretation and analysis is necessary to the successful early detection of IEDs. The fielding of high-resolution SAR sensors on a UAV platform requires SAR operators with highly specialized skills and experience. The Copperhead SAR is a unique, very small format SAR. While most SAR systems are large and are carried on large air vehicles, the Copperhead micro-SAR is the only SAR small enough to be carried by a UAS the size of the Tigershark that provides such high resolution imagery. Because of the size of the raw imagery, the Copperhead SAR is the only SAR that allows analysis of 300Mb/sec to be analyzed on the ground in near real time. Such high resolution change detection imagery allows analysts to distinguish between red team activities and everyday activities.</p>
<p>The current contract for these services expires in March 2014 and this requirement is for only a 12 month contract. As such, there is insufficient time to train an entirely new workforce of Copperhead SAR operators, especially considering the critical nature of this tasking where an increased margin of error equates to loss of life and additional casualties to coalition troops in the Copperhead areas of operation. In order to meet the requirements of this effort, the contractor must have UAV-SAR experience and their analysts must possess the specialized skillset required to analyze Micro-SAR data. AirScan is the only known company that currently has experience both in fielding high-resolution stripmap SAR sensors on UAV platforms and experience analyzing Micro-SAR data, specifically for Copperhead. AirScan has been providing the SAR operator support services (CONUS and OCONUS) for Copperhead, inlcuding the Copperhead detachments in Afghanistan, for the past four (4) years under the current Department Of Energy contract for these services. AirScan possesses unique capabilities and experience necessary to successfully perform the highly specialized tasking of this requirement.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal in writing that shall be considered by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This requirement is for the procurement of 3 items of varying quantities in support of the Optimized Top Owl (OTO) system CONUS repair stand-up effort.  The items being procured currently do not have NSNs but are typically identified as Thales Avionics' part numbers F1517001, E41003AA, and E41055AA.  
This procurement is for 10 units of P/N E41055AA, 10 units of E41003AA, and 35 units of F1517001.
This procurement has an estimated amount of $728,000.
The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for these items will be solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The Fort Harrison VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all A/E services to remove and replace a cooling tower and replace the existing chiller and provide a secondary chiller for redundancy in the Operating Rooms and associated surgical/sterile area of the VA Medical Center.

The A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.  Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A/E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.   All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The A/E will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial 30% estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, a 90% design submission, a 95% design submission, and the final 100%.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The A/E will provide documents at each submission as indicated in the statement of work.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business magnitude of $14.0 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search.

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.




Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

<DESC>This RFI is a market survey for information to be used for planning purposes only. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain and evaluate information from industry on potential sources providing high-power fiber laser systems for a unique application in the testing of atmospheric-entry heat shield materials.  The NASA Ames Research Center currently operates a variety of arc-heated facilities within the Arc Jet Complex. These facilities are used to generate flow environments that simulate the aero thermal environment that an object experiences when traversing the atmosphere of a planet. They are used primarily to test heat shield materials and thermal protection system (TPS) components for planetary entry vehicles, planetary probes, and hypersonic flight vehicles, although other investigative studies are performed in some of these facilities. In the arc jet facilities, TPS components are exposed to the aero thermodynamic heating conditions that they will encounter during high-speed flight. NASA conducted extensive trade studies focused on available methods for delivering radiant energy to test sample materials (in conjunction with convective energy).  NASA has decided to employ fiber laser technology and seeks information on sources that can provide the following requirements: Laser System Requirements and Characteristics: Laser operation: continuous wave (CW) Laser wavelength: 1070-1080 nm Maximum combined laser output: 200 kW Feeding Fiber Length: 20 meter minimum Beam Parameter Product (BPP): less than 12 mm-mrad Dynamic power modulation range: 10% to 100% of full power per laser Output power modulation rate: 3 kHz minimum  Minimum run duration: 20 minutes Power stability over run time: better than 2 percent  Operational and Support Requirements: Maximum area available for laser support equipment: 4.5 meter by 6 meter Wall plug efficiency: 20% minimum Electrical requirement: 208V or 440V, 3P This information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response to this request.  Funding is not available for procurement at this time; this RFI is subject to review or cancellation at any time.  The NAICS code associated with this work is 335999; the small business size standard is 500 employees. The schedule, method of solicitation, type of contract, set aside potential, selection criteria, pricing structure, and other considerations to be used in any subsequent procurement will depend on NASAs analysis of the responses received from this RFI. NASA is familiar with the capabilities of IPG Photonics YLS-50000 fiber laser and seeks information on this or equivalent equipment to fulfill this need. We request industry experts to provide any information, solutions, or product offering that will meet our requirements.  We are looking for all pertinent technical and other information to assist us in our acquisition planning, including: rough order of magnitude for pricing, purchase or lease-option availability, product lead time for delivery, and any information believed to be helpful in our market research and in determining industry capabilities.	 Responses to this RFI must include the following minimum information:  Company name, address, points of contact, phone number, e-mail, and website (if applicable), number of years in business, and name of parent company (if applicable).	Also required is information about the vendors business size (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned), whether the firm is under a GSA Schedule Contract for this product, and which industries the vendor identifies itself with in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Detailed requirements for the acquisition have not been finalized, nor have the specifics for the acquisition strategy been determined.  NASA intends to use the results of its market research to aid in the making of these final decisions.	The objectives of this RFI are: to provide industry with preliminary information regarding this potential acquisition, solicit information about potential sources and ROM pricing estimates, to identify the capabilities of small business and other business classifications to perform the work, and to invite potential offerors to submit comments regarding the fulfillment of this requirement. Responses to this RFI are due by 3:30 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday, January 15, 2014. Interested parties are requested to submit their technical information, capability statements, suggestions, as well as any comments on the acquisition approach (email only) to the Contracting Officer, Elizabeth Baierl, email:  elizabeth.a.baierl@nasa.gov.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis: This synopsis constitutes neither a Request for Proposal nor an Invitation for Bid. It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This request is for informational purposes only and possible vendor demonstration on mature technologies and systems (Technology Readiness Level 7, 8, or 9 as defined at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf, pages 2-13 through 2-14). <br> Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by any information received. <br> 1.	Background and Scope: <br> The United States (US) Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) was established in 2003 to combine and integrate functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Component Commands (ACC) with the purpose of accelerating material solutions and technology insertion to forces committed in the Global War on Terror. In 2005, the Chief of Staff, Army (CSA) further refined REF's mission to include the following three broad functions. <br>  	Provide the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire, and integrate commercial and government off-the-shelf solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces. <br>  	Develop and insert selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and spiral development. <br>  	Plan and execute assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities, and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders.  <br> In an effort to defeat United States (US) intelligence and weapons technologies and to gain tactical and operational advantages both Military and irregular threats have begun relocating, and redeploying functions into subterranean operational environments (SbT OE). The growing use of tunnels and underground facilities (UGF) by military and irregular forces to gain a tactical advantage is becoming more sophisticated and increasingly effective, making the likelihood of US Forces encountering military-purposed subterranean structures on future battlefields high.  The Middle East is full of ancient and modern underground systems that can be used as assets for the enemy forces.  In the US, both the northern and southern borders of the nation have had tunnels discovered connecting the US to Canada and Mexico being used by criminal elements for human smuggling, drug running, and other illegal activities.  <br> Besides specialized tools and equipment, US Forces need to have specialized personnel available for subterranean (SbT) combat operations, or at least incorporate a rigorous and realistic SbT warfare curriculum into the US Force's education system.  With proper training and equipment, US Forces can achieve greater success and lower the risk of death or injury occurring during operations within SbT environments. <br> The purpose of this RFI is to determine existing and emerging Commercial-off-the Shelf (COTS) or Government-off -the-shelf (GOTS) technologies across several areas of interest that can be used to enhance warfighter capabilities in subterranean environments worldwide.  The technology must not require any safety precautions or pose any safety or health hazards (i.e. toxic components, toxic waste, gases, fumes, burning residue, noise, etc.) against which user personnel cannot be protected. <br>  <br>  <br> 2.	Capability Requirements: <br> The Government is interested in receiving information on a broad array of technologies that have the potential to enhance warfighter capabilities in the subterranean operating environment. All proposed technologies should be capable of being transported by a single soldier and shall not create a more hazardous condition within the SbT environment without mitigation techniques, tactics, procedures (TTPs), and/or technologies.  Lighter weight systems are preferred. The Government is interested in receiving white papers focused on the following technology areas (TA):  <br>  	TA: Mobility - Soldiers must gain and maintain the tactical advantage in SbT environments. This requires Soldiers to have the ability to maintain freedom of movement through all types of terrain and obstacles. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, mountaineering equipment used to climb vertical shafts and systems, both manned and robotic  equipment (not bound by  the single soldier portability  requirement) that can assist in carrying the combat load of a soldier in a SbT environment.  <br>  	TA: Protection - SbT environments limit the cover and protection available to a Soldier, highlighting the need for protection from the effects enemy weapons up to 7.62 mm machine gun weapons and hand-grenades. The enclosed nature of SbT environments may expose Soldiers to hazardous noise levels. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to ballistic shields and hearing protection. <br>  	TA: Reconnaissance - Soldiers need reconnaissance technologies that can increase Soldier capability to understand and map the layout of the subterranean environment and to understand the threats the Soldier may encounter, including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and/or high-explosive (CBRNE) threats. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, unmanned systems to map the SbT environment in a denied Global Position System (GPS) environment or GPS aided environment; systems that can assess air quality and structural integrity; systems that can detect effluents escaping ventilation shafts and systems that can identify enemy threats such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  <br>  	TA: Communications - The SbT OE hampers Soldier communications using standard radio frequency (RF)-based radios currently carried by the Soldier, making mission command and control difficult.  Specialized technology and/or TTPs are required to enable data, video, and voice communication between Soldiers and unmanned systems/sensors operating inside and outside the subterranean environment. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, iridium satellite, meshed networks, non-RF communications, optical/infra-red relays, and automated communications relays.  <br>  	TA: Breaching - Breaching technologies are needed to open secure entryways or to create new entryways in deliberately constructed SbT environments. These technologies are varied in nature and can be mechanical, explosive, ballistic, or thermal.  Breaching technologies should also include any personal protective equipment required or recommended to be used by operators of the technology. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, rescue style cutting tools, mechanical/hydraulic pry tools, and flame/hydraulic cutting tools.  Note:  breaching technologies shall not create a more hazardous condition within the SbT environment against which user personnel cannot be protected.  <br>  	TA: Life Support - Soldiers require life support systems when air quality and oxygen levels in a SbT environment are unknown or assessed to be poor. Soldiers require the capability to sustain themselves in low quality air environments due to pollutants, obscurants, chemicals, and low airflow. Soldiers must also be prepared to conduct causality evacuation (CASEVAC) in confined spaces. Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, portable breathing devices, smoke hoods, hand held air quality sensors, and CASEVAC support enablers.  <br>  	TA: Visibility - Soldiers require the ability to operate in a SbT OE where there may be no direct, indirect, or ambient light. Examples of technologies may include, but are not limited to, portable lighting sources capable of penetrating into a long tunnel or passage, light sources capable of penetrating obscurants, thermal imaging devices, throwable devices that create ambient and/or infra-red light that can be amplified by currently fielded night vision devices, or other devices capable of enhancing vision in a low/no light SbT environments.  <br>  	TA:  Situational Awareness - Soldiers require the ability to operate in a SbT OE knowing the locations of entrance and exit routes as well as knowing the locations of other friendly force units and enemy forces.  Examples of potential solutions may include, but are not limited to, passive and active tagging systems, directional indicators, and blue-force/red-force tracking sensors. <br>  <br> 3. Instructions to Potential Respondents <br> This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  Interested vendors who desire to participate in this market survey and demonstration event are encouraged to submit white papers that demonstrate they presently have the technology and qualifications to satisfy the capability requirement of one or more of the TA's described above. White papers should be prepared in Microsoft Word format using standard margins and font size not less than 11. An example white paper format is attached. White papers for each technology should be no more than 5 pages in length and should address at a minimum the following topics:  <br>  	How the technology addresses the capability requirement and would be used in the subterranean environment by general purpose US Army Soldiers? <br>  	What limitations does the vendor foresee with the uses of their technology in a subterranean environment? <br>  	How easy would it be to understand, deploy, and employ by general purpose US Army Soldiers in a SbT environment? <br>  	To what testing specifications has the technology been tested? <br>  <br> White papers should discuss the ability to provide existing technologies (Technology Readiness Levels 7, 8, or 9) to improve soldier performance in a subterranean environment and include a rough order magnitude (ROM) unit cost.  White papers should indicate if the proposed equipment has been sold to the US Government and /or any other organization;  if it has been tested by a DoD Agency or independent third party; and, should include relevant points of contact for each organization.  <br> White papers should be submitted electronically to Tara Casey via email at tara.l.casey.civ@mail.mil <br> Please only submit information on products that are currently available through procurement or products that are in final stages of development and are available for vendor demonstration and Government test and evaluation.   <br> Interested parties shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research and demonstrating their technologies. <br> Vendors that submit white papers that demonstrate viable capabilities to enable or enhance Soldiers' subterranean operations may be invited to participate in one or more events to demonstrate their technologies in the subterranean environment.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS TASK ORDER.<br /></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Task Order was to support the EPA Water Quality Management program in overseeing the implementation of ARRA by conducting an analysis of the ARRA-funded 604(b) planning projects. The period of performance for this task order was from April 25, 2011 through April 30, 2012. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is now completed</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Modification 5 is to obligate $305.91 of ARRA funding in order to pay a trailing invoice associated with a new indirect cost rate agreement. Total funding for this order is now $144,648.49.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Thomson Reuters Scholar One, 1500 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, PA 19130 for technical assistance, support and development of user specified enhancements for the existing customized, proprietary internet-based system that meets the specific production workflow needs and requirement of Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) for one year with two option years offered if funds are available. The production workflow system 1) allows authors to submit manuscripts online to PCD over the Internet; 2) facilitates PCD online peer review and administration; 3) provides for tracking of PCD manuscripts through peer review and publication using the Internet; and 4) generates PCD reports and automatic e-mail correspondence from the PCD database(s). <br />There are five tasks to be performed under this scope of work including: <br />1. Maintenance and support of existing manuscript submission and management system configuration and functionality<br />2. User support and training on manuscript submission and management system functionality<br />3. Hosting Internet Access to manuscript submission and management system<br />4. System security for manuscript submission and management system<br />5. Management and archiving of data in the manuscript submission and management system
<p>Scholar One's Manuscript Central system contains all manuscripts submitted, author information, reviewer information and publication meta data. The system has been specifically customized to meet the work requirements of the PCD workflow. <br />Exclusive licensing agreements: The currently functioning system supporting the management of manuscripts submitted to PCD is a proprietary system. No other offeror has the level of access required to perform the tasks outlined in the scope of work. <br />Compatibility: Manuscript Central is currently used by PCD and has been customized for the journals specific workflow. Any other product would require substantial resources in terms of time and startup costs for customization and likely not be able to meet all the current functionality of Manuscript Central as currently configured. Furthermore no other system would be compatible as all the historical data would at risk of not being accessible. The lack of access to our existing data would negatively impact the ability of the journal to carry out its mission. Poor performance of the journal will reflect poorly on the scientific quality and integrity of the Agency.<br />This system is mission critical for the functioning of the journal. Any lapse in service will have substantial negative impact on the continued operations of PCD and will not be able to continue to successfully achieve our mission and service to the approximately 47000 subscribers. Development and configuration of a new system would require an extensive reconfiguration, substantial time and resources and would not result in the best interest of the government.</p>
<p>This contract action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) and 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be e-mailed to purchasing agent Rebecca Mullenax at rmullenax@cdc.gov by COB on December 26, 2013.<br />FAR Reference: FAR 5.207 - Preparation and transmittal of synopses under (c) (15), (c) (16) (i) and (c) (16) (ii).</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Transport Specimen Bags. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Transport Specimen Bags products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Transport Specimen Bags. The QSL for Transport Specimen Bags will be established approximately November 2013 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately December 2013 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Transport Specimen Bags. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Transport Specimen Bags.</p>
<p><strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br /></strong>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transport Specimen Bags. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $415,289.46. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eighteen product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this QSL. Of the eighteen product groups, four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL, account for 73.74% ($306,222.07) of the total volume in sales ($415,289.46), and are the required products for this QSL. The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in being added to the QSL will provide a response to the FBO Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses will include detailed information requested in the requirements listed in the FBO Sources Sought notification and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the FBO Package Worksheet</strong>. A vendor who cannot open the FBO Package Worksheet may contact the POC as noted in the FBO Sources Sought notification and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). Upon submission of the requested information, vendor will be provided ship to addresses and requested to provide required products for evaluation as indicated in Evaluation paragraph below. <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for subsequent participation in the Standardization Action. Submissions received after the date listed for closing will be reviewed periodically and vendors will be notified of whether they met or did not meet the QSL requirements within approximately 240 days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br /></strong>The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection for the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>Contractor will need a DUNS number, TIN number and be registered with www.SAM.gov</p>
<p>Acceptance Period: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the government.</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>J&amp;A - Brand Name &amp; Sole Source<br /><br />The existing CCTV system is proprietary to Kongsberg; to install a new replacement system is estimated to be costly and would require extensive rewiring and more resulting time than is available in the ZEUS Overhaul schedule.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />SCOPE OF WORK <br />NFFS7300-14-00181 <br />TAGGING AND BEHAVIORAL MONITORING OF SEA LIONS <br />IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN PROXIMITY TO NAVY FACILITIES</p>
<p>QUOTING: THE BREAK DOWN IS GOOD TO SEE, BUT THE REQUIREMENT <br />WILL BE A LUMP SUM FIRM FIXED PRICE AWARD.</p>
<p>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center has entered into an Interagency Agreement with the US Navy, Pacific Fleet Environmental to conduct a study of Tagging and Behavioral Monitoring of Sea lions in the Pacific Northwest in Proximity to Navy Facilities. Projects in the 2 year study include: Assess number of California sea lions and percentage of time animals are hauling-out each month on structures and assets near Puget Sound naval facilities at Everett, Bremerton and Bangor, assess the location of marine foraging areas and assess the foraging behavior of adult male sea lions in inland waters of Washington.</p>
<p>To accomplish these projects NMML, a contracted group or agency (Contractor) and Navy Facilities engineering Command Northwest personnel will conduct weekly surveys of sea lions hauling out at each of the three facilities. The Contractor will construct and deploy floating sea lion hauling platforms/traps at Naval Station Everett and Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, and monitor them for sea lion use. The Contractor will capture 30 adult male sea lions and NMML will attach satellite tags to their pelage to track their hauling and foraging behavior.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be carried out by the contractor are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Labor and Overhead is estimated at about 2000 hours.</p>
<p>&bull; The estimated cost for Travel is at $6,500. Your company may estimate a lower or higher sum in this fixed rate for the order. The travel estimate is based upon our estimate of travel needed to conduct surveys, animal captures, and instrument recovery over ~ 2 year period at prevailing GSA rates. The GSA rates were used for estimate purposes.</p>
<p>&bull; Weekly censuses of the number of California sea lion males hauled out will be conducted by the Contractor at Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton in conjunction with and coordinated with similar sea lions censuses at NAVSTA Everett by NMML staff and at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor by staff of Navy Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. To optimize the timing of those counts hourly counts will be conducted on one day each month at each location to assess diurnal patterns in number of animals hauled-out. The hour of maximum number hauled out will be used to conduct all censuses during the 2-week period. The Contractor must have a Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act Permit that allow them to conduct census activity of California and Steller Sea Lions including "takes" by harassment.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor must have expertise and experience in designing and operating floating sea lion traps. The Contractor will provide to NMML specifications of a hauling platform and trap. The Contractor will install a 16 X 16 foot hauling platform and trap at NAVSTA Everett and Bremerton by anchoring it to the ocean bottom.</p>
<p>&bull; To estimate the proportion of time hauled out and locations of foraging areas the Contractor will provide 3 biologists who with assistance of NMML staff will capture 30 or more adult male California sea lions in Puget Sound on a floating trap and attach satellite tags to the pelage of restrained animal. The Contractor's personnel must have expertise and experience capturing and handling large and dangerous adult male California and Steller Sea lion in the wild. Demonstrated experience handling adult male California sea lions is required to assure personnel safety and animal care considerations.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff in retrieval of instrument packages from sea lions. Sea lions undergo annual migration between Washington and rookeries in California and in August undergo a molt during which the instrument packs will fall off. Aerial and boat surveys will be used to recovery instruments in coastal California, Oregon and Washington. The Contractor must have experience in tracking instruments with VHF radio tags from aircraft and vessels.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff with reporting and publication of findings. <br />3. Annual reports required by 15 May 2014 and 15 May 2015 within the NMFS/Navy Interagency Agreement. The Contractor's contributions will be due 1 May each year.<br />4. Comprehensive report due 30 September 2015 with the following elements:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will provide a quarterly report of census data of adult male haul out at NAVSTA Kitsap Bremerton</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist with calculation of monthly correction factors for count data from NAVSTA Everett or other trapping location by species as appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on geographical distribution and foraging behavior of California sea lion adult males in inland waters of Washington (and Steller Sea Lions if tagged).</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on migration and foraging behavior of California sea lions in coastal Washington, Oregon and California (and Steller Sea Lions, if tagged).<br />&emsp;<br />ACQUISITION ALERT 13-07 DATED JULY 31, 2013 <br />SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY AND RESEARCH MISCONDUCT<br />(NAO 202-735D) - ATTACHMENT<br />SCIENTIFIC AND RESEARCH MISCONDUCT</p>

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC><p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Purpose </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (the "Request") is to solicit competitive proposals for the retention of an experienced executive search consultant to provide services to the Postal Regulatory Commission ("Commission") as it seeks candidates for the General Counsel position, which will become vacant in January 2014. The General Counsel position is, in terms of salary, roughly the equivalent of an Executive Schedule Level II employee. The Commission would like to make an offer to a new candidate no later than March 2014.</p>
<p>This Request is intended to solicit information pertaining to the advantages, quality of services and costs associated with an executive search process. The consultants to be considered will be expected to submit their responses to this Request by November 12, 2013. Following an initial screening, finalists will meet with the Commission at its offices in Washington DC. The anticipated selection date is December 6, 2013.</p>
<p>This Request does not commit the Commission to any reimbursements of costs or expenses which may be incurred by the respondent in preparing for this Request or any costs or expenses incurred by the respondent prior to the execution of a contracted agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this Request, to negotiate separately with competing respondents, and to accept that proposal which, in its judgment, is in the best interests of the Commission.</p>
<strong>
<p>About the Postal Regulatory Commission</p>
</strong>
<p>The Commission is an independent agency that has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Initially, that oversight consisted primarily of conducting public, on-the-record hearings concerning proposed rate, mail classification or major service changes, and recommending decisions for action by the postal Governors.</p>
<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) enacted on December 20, 2006, significantly strengthened the Commission's authority to serve as a counterbalance to new flexibility granted to the Postal Service in setting postal rates. The Act requires the Commission to develop and maintain regulations for a modern system of rate regulation, consult with the Postal Service on delivery service standards and performance measures, consult with the Department of State on international postal</p>
<p>policies, prevent cross-subsidization or other anticompetitive postal practices, promote transparency and accountability, and adjudicate complaints.</p>
<p>The law also assigns new and continuing oversight responsibilities to the PRC, including annual determinations of Postal Service compliance with applicable laws, development of accounting practices and procedures for the Postal Service, review of the Universal Service requirement, and assurance of transparency through periodic reports. New enforcement tools include subpoena power, authority to direct the Postal Service to adjust rates and to take other remedial actions, and levying fines in cases of deliberate noncompliance with applicable postal laws.</p>
<em>
<p><strong>Commission Leadership</strong></p>
</em>
<p>The Commission is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of six years. A Commissioner may continue to serve after the expiration of his or her term for up to one year or until a successor is confirmed. No more than three members of the Commission may be from one political party. The Chairman is designated by the President and serves as the chief administrator of the agency.</p>
<p>Assisting the Commission is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The Commission is organized into four operating offices:</p>
<p><strong>Accountability and Compliance</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Counsel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Affairs and Government Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secretary</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commission maintains an independent office for its Inspector General.</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Accountability &amp; Compliance is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for Commission review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, and other issues. The Office evaluates Postal Service accounting records, financial reports, and other financial data to assess accuracy, completeness, and conformance to reporting and procedural standards established by the Commission. This includes reports filed pursuant to SEC rules and procedures. The Office assists the Commission in its annual determinations of compliance with service performance standards and the preparation of the annual report to the President and Congress.</p>
<p>The Office of General Counsel provides legal assistance on matters involving the Commission's responsibilities, defends Commission decisions before the courts, and manages the formal complaint process.</p>
<p>The Office of Public Affairs &amp; Government Relations facilitates prompt and responsive communications for the Commission with the public, Congress and federal agencies, the Postal Service, and information media.</p>
<p>The Office of Secretary &amp; Administration records the official actions of the Commission; preserves Commission documents; maintains personnel records; and provides other support services including managing the Commission's library, docket room, and computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General conducts, supervises, and coordinates audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission, and identifies and reports fraud and abuse in Commission programs and operations.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Secretary of the Commission has been charged by the Chairman with managing the process for the recruitment and identification of well-qualified finalists for the position of General Counsel. The General Counsel serves at the pleasure of the Commission. The Commissioners will make the final selection for the position.</p>
<p>To assist it in performing this duty, the Commission seeks to engage a well-qualified executive search firm with extensive experience in placing high-level government executives in high-performing organizations. From the Commission's perspective, a successful consulting relationship will be characterized by straightforward, creative, independent consulting, accurate information and analyses, timely and informative responses to requests for information and cultural fit. We are anticipating filling the position from a local applicant pool.</p>
<p>The selected candidate, in addition to performing the consultative, search, and placement services, will be expected to conduct up to three meetings with Commission leadership to discuss perspectives on the scope of responsibilities and ideal qualities for candidates for the General Counsel position. Up to two meetings with Commission leadership to discuss specific potential candidates will also be conducted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. <br />(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: <br />Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.<br />Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. <br />(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. <br />(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. <br />(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. <br />(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: <br />(i) warrants; <br />(ii) options; <br />(iii) contracts to acquire stock; <br />(iv) convertible debt instruments; and <br />(v) others similar interests. <br />(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. <br />(f) Disclosure.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

Depending on the location of services, travel/per diem/lodging may very well be incurred.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC><p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Purpose </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this Request for Proposal (the "Request") is to solicit competitive proposals for the retention of an experienced executive search consultant to provide services to the Postal Regulatory Commission ("Commission") as it seeks candidates for the General Counsel position, which will become vacant in January 2014. The General Counsel position is, in terms of salary, roughly the equivalent of an Executive Schedule Level II employee. The Commission would like to make an offer to a new candidate no later than March 2014.</p>
<p>This Request is intended to solicit information pertaining to the advantages, quality of services and costs associated with an executive search process. The consultants to be considered will be expected to submit their responses to this Request by November 12, 2013. Following an initial screening, finalists will meet with the Commission at its offices in Washington DC. The anticipated selection date is December 6, 2013.</p>
<p>This Request does not commit the Commission to any reimbursements of costs or expenses which may be incurred by the respondent in preparing for this Request or any costs or expenses incurred by the respondent prior to the execution of a contracted agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this Request, to negotiate separately with competing respondents, and to accept that proposal which, in its judgment, is in the best interests of the Commission.</p>
<strong>
<p>About the Postal Regulatory Commission</p>
</strong>
<p>The Commission is an independent agency that has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Initially, that oversight consisted primarily of conducting public, on-the-record hearings concerning proposed rate, mail classification or major service changes, and recommending decisions for action by the postal Governors.</p>
<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) enacted on December 20, 2006, significantly strengthened the Commission's authority to serve as a counterbalance to new flexibility granted to the Postal Service in setting postal rates. The Act requires the Commission to develop and maintain regulations for a modern system of rate regulation, consult with the Postal Service on delivery service standards and performance measures, consult with the Department of State on international postal</p>
<p>policies, prevent cross-subsidization or other anticompetitive postal practices, promote transparency and accountability, and adjudicate complaints.</p>
<p>The law also assigns new and continuing oversight responsibilities to the PRC, including annual determinations of Postal Service compliance with applicable laws, development of accounting practices and procedures for the Postal Service, review of the Universal Service requirement, and assurance of transparency through periodic reports. New enforcement tools include subpoena power, authority to direct the Postal Service to adjust rates and to take other remedial actions, and levying fines in cases of deliberate noncompliance with applicable postal laws.</p>
<em>
<p><strong>Commission Leadership</strong></p>
</em>
<p>The Commission is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of six years. A Commissioner may continue to serve after the expiration of his or her term for up to one year or until a successor is confirmed. No more than three members of the Commission may be from one political party. The Chairman is designated by the President and serves as the chief administrator of the agency.</p>
<p>Assisting the Commission is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The Commission is organized into four operating offices:</p>
<p><strong>Accountability and Compliance</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Counsel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Affairs and Government Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secretary</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commission maintains an independent office for its Inspector General.</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Accountability &amp; Compliance is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for Commission review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, and other issues. The Office evaluates Postal Service accounting records, financial reports, and other financial data to assess accuracy, completeness, and conformance to reporting and procedural standards established by the Commission. This includes reports filed pursuant to SEC rules and procedures. The Office assists the Commission in its annual determinations of compliance with service performance standards and the preparation of the annual report to the President and Congress.</p>
<p>The Office of General Counsel provides legal assistance on matters involving the Commission's responsibilities, defends Commission decisions before the courts, and manages the formal complaint process.</p>
<p>The Office of Public Affairs &amp; Government Relations facilitates prompt and responsive communications for the Commission with the public, Congress and federal agencies, the Postal Service, and information media.</p>
<p>The Office of Secretary &amp; Administration records the official actions of the Commission; preserves Commission documents; maintains personnel records; and provides other support services including managing the Commission's library, docket room, and computers.</p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General conducts, supervises, and coordinates audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission, and identifies and reports fraud and abuse in Commission programs and operations.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Secretary of the Commission has been charged by the Chairman with managing the process for the recruitment and identification of well-qualified finalists for the position of General Counsel. The General Counsel serves at the pleasure of the Commission. The Commissioners will make the final selection for the position.</p>
<p>To assist it in performing this duty, the Commission seeks to engage a well-qualified executive search firm with extensive experience in placing high-level government executives in high-performing organizations. From the Commission's perspective, a successful consulting relationship will be characterized by straightforward, creative, independent consulting, accurate information and analyses, timely and informative responses to requests for information and cultural fit. We are anticipating filling the position from a local applicant pool.</p>
<p>The selected candidate, in addition to performing the consultative, search, and placement services, will be expected to conduct up to three meetings with Commission leadership to discuss perspectives on the scope of responsibilities and ideal qualities for candidates for the General Counsel position. Up to two meetings with Commission leadership to discuss specific potential candidates will also be conducted.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>

The contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement.

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  This Division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide technical expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  The primary roles of SRG contactors include intermittent backfill for permanent staff deploying to overseas, cover vacancies domestically or in overseas offices, and to respond to numerous disasters worldwide in a timely manner.  Currently, about half of all SRG activations are domestic and half overseas in various capacities.</p>
<p>The SRG program brings on board select candidates who work on full-time for discrete periods of time, but on an intermittent basis for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations.  SRG staff can be used for as little as a day or up to several months at a time.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA's Operations Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted SRG personnel, providing information to the rest of OFDA on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG.  Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA/Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA needs to maintain a roster of SRG personnel to meet its surge capacity objectives, including individuals with administrative expertise to provide expert level administrative support to OFDA in Washington, DC, as well as overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>There was a mistake in one of the question. Please review below question.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question<br />Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Bidders, paragraph 2 provides the specific PWS paragraphs that will be evaluated for the Part II Technical Proposal. Are we correct to assume these are the only items we are to respond to in the proposal response or does the government want responses to all PWS requirements? Please clarify.</p>
<p>Old Answer<br />The government wants a response to all the PWS requirements.</p>
<p>NEW ANSWER</p>
<p>Yes you are correct in your assumption.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Since the directions in Section L and M specified exact paragraphs that would be evaluated, the new direction is to respond to all PWS paragraphs, will there be an extension forthcoming to accommodate the additional time needed to respond to all PWS sections?</p>
<p><br />Answer<br />Please see about correction to question.</p>
<p>Question<br />Paragraphs 1.6 - 1.9 are Labor category description/requirements. Since these are buried in the middle of the PWS, is it the government's intent that the bidder respond to each sub paragraph in the labor descriptions?</p>
<p><br />Answer<br />Please see about correction to question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question<br />The current solicitation directs one methodology for responding yet the Q&amp;A provides a different approach. Section M clearly states that proposals will be evaluated by specific paragraphs... 1.1.1 through 1.1.6, 1.2.1, 1.2.2.1.1. and 1.2.2.1.2, and 1.3.1, 1.3.1.1 and 1.3.5 etc. Will the government be releasing a new sections L and section M to clarify what is needed?</p>
<p>Answer<br />Please see about correction to question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />Other Question Received</p>
<p>Question<br />In the Q&amp;A response the government states that the section B quantity of 50 is to help with the systems and that the government is going to award task orders and because the government does not know how many are going to be ordered a bigger number was included to make sure there is enough in the long run. Since the supplier is required to complete section B with total price how are we to fill in the price so the pricing proposal and units of "lots" match correctly? In other words how do we price a "lot" when the price breakdown is not in that unit?</p>
<p>Answer<br />We are not asking you to bid on a total cost per lot, we are asking you to bid your labor rates for the different job categories. The total cost of the contract is going to come from the table that is attached in the solicitation where you will place your labor rates per category.</p>

<a href="mailto:donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Solicitation No. W15P7T-13-R-5005, which serves as a notification to industry of procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms.  SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments, although a four-channel system may be considered.  SANR will replace the current Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capability, and provide new Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability offering voice and data networking capability and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms.  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  <br>    <br>  The anticipated date for release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about 18 October 2013.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the draft RFP, and subsequently for the formal RFP, will be posted with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation.  <br>    <br>  The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, two Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One-Year base period and four (4) One-Year option periods.  After contract award, the Government intends to subsequently make a down-select to a single contractor for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SANR systems, spares, and associated support.  The Government will reserve the right to exercise LRIP and FRP quantities of SANR systems, spares, and associated support under both contracts if it is determined to be in its best interest.  <br>    <br>  It is the Government's intent to award the two contracts in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process.    <br>    <br>  Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.  <br>    <br>  The above discussed intent is subject to change.   <br>    <br>  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.  <br>    <br>  The response date indicated on this synopsis does not require a response from industry.  DO NOT submit any documentation / proposals / letters of any kind in response to this synopsis.  <br>    <br>  Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  <br>    <br>  All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email address identified above. Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above. Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.  <br>  <br> AMENDMENT 1 - 27 SEPTEMBER 2013 <br>  <br> THE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE ORIGINAL PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE ONLY APPLIES TO SOLICITATION W15P7T-13-R-5005.   <br>  <br> The SANR RFI process and on-going dialogue with industry are not being conducted under the solicitation number.  ACC-APG has intentionally used references such as W15P7T12SANRINDUSTRYUPDATE01, W15P7T12SANRINDUSTRYUPDATE02, etc. to distinguish these other communications from those that are solicitation related.   <br>  <br> The purpose of the communications limitation for solicitation W15P7T-13-R-5005 is to advise industry to not make any communications related to the solicitation other than through the contracting officer.  No party should communicate with anyone other than the contracting officer about the solicitation.  All solicitation related notices will include solicitation number W15P7T-13-R-5005. <br>  <br> Continued communication conducted within the scope of any Requests for Information (RFI) efforts or other industry exchanges not specifically related to the solicitation should proceed.  However, once a draft RFP is released, the RFI process and on-going dialogue with industry shall stop, and all communications will thereafter be in accordance with the draft RFP/RFP instructions. <br>

Due to technical obstacles beyond the Contracting Officer's control, the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website allowed posting of questions until December 10th, 2013. Under such circumstances of conflict, the solicitation directions take precedence. Given the complication, all questions submitted via ASFI or other means up until December 10th are being answered. The questions, answers, and the resulting amended solicitation will be posted as soon as possible. No further questions will be accepted.  <br>  <br> Due to delays from inclement weather closing Government offices, and the volume of questions submitted for solicitation W15P7T-13-R-E006, the proposal submission deadline has been extended to 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Thursday, January 2nd 2014.

<a href="mailto:teresa.a.baxter.civ@mail.mil">USPFO for Tennessee</a>
<DESC>SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION:  Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Architect and Engineering Services Contract.  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO), Tennessee National Guard, intends to award four firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services contracts.  This announcement is being synopsized as unrestricted.  Small business size standard is $14.0 Million for NAICS 541330.  The Point of contact for this announcement is Teresa Baxter.  Submit questions to teresa.a.baxter.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The work requires multi-discipline professional A-E services for various projects throughout the State of Tennessee for the Tennessee Air National Guard/Tennessee Army National Guard.  The services provided are to be conforming to the Brooks Act (PL) 92-582. The selection of a firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather the process for A-E firm selection described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36 using the competitive ranking of firms based upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  The competitive ranking will be followed by negotiations with the four (4) most highly ranked firms and continuing to lower ranked firms. If satisfactory terms are not reached with the preferred firm as described in FAR 36.606 the next conforming firm will be contacted for negotiation. The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Tennessee intends to award four (4) Firm-Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer (A-E) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts, with Options, for support of National Guard activities throughout the State of Tennessee (Tennessee Air National Guard/Tennessee Army National Guard).  The A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.  A one-time minimum guaranteed amount for the contract is $1,000.00; and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of the contract with a $2,000,000 limit per year with $500,000 on individual Task Order except in unusual circumstances and approved by higher headquarters up to $750,000.00.

I would assume that this would refer at least to lodging and per diem, but does it also include vehicle/gas costs? <br> Answer 1. First the Synopsis W9122L7-14-R-0001 is cancelled. Use the W912L7-14-R-0001, it is a correct one.   <br> Second, the travel cost will be in your burdened rate(s) there will not be any travel paid. This is a directive from the PARCs office so this is not subject to change. Let me say this though, in very special cases that the Contracting Officer approves and with funding travel could be paid. Expect that there will be no funding allowed. Budgets are getting tighter so this request is for A&Es in the state to eliminate costs.  <br> Question 2: The synopsis contains the following under the section for Selection Criteria: Section (4) PAST PERFORMANCE on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. List, but do not submit, no more than five (5) actual copies of recent awards, commendations or other superior performance indicators. <br> It appears that there is a conflict within the second sentence since it indicates  quote mark List, but do not submit, no more than five (5) actual copies quote mark  of awards.  Will you clarify if you are seeking a listing of awards or if you want copies of awards?  If copies of awards are sought, are the copies in addition to the listed page limit?  If you want a listing of awards, will you define the level of detail you are seeking regards to the award?  <br> Answer 2: The  quote mark List quote mark  means submit the project information you want us to know about, but do not submit the actual contract please. List the appropriate information: contract number, DoD project name, what was the project,  the degree of work performed, period of performance, degree of difficulty and complexity, did the project come in for the estimated amount, etcetera. The requirement is for 2 copies of your submittals per area, but some wish to add more. Don't exceed 5 copies. Yes this is part of your 20 pages.  The clarification of 20 pages: one page has a front and a back. You may use both but don't exceed 20 pages. The 254 is not part of the page count. See Question 3 for more on 254s.   <br> There was ambiguity with the word  quote mark award quote mark : This term means accolade to a civilian but to contracting an award is a contract. Since there was more than one question on this concept the decision is it can mean both. But use Caution; past performance is the heading of the section so we are asking for descriptions on actual work performed. Stating only awards (accolade) with no project information would not be complete.     <br> Question 3: Does DD254 DOD Contract Security Classification Specification get submitted? Is this form done by the Government? <br> Answer 3: Yes, we want a DD254 on all the prime people in the submission. THIS IS NOT PART OF THE PAGE REQUIREMENT.  There may be some work requirements that require higher degree of security by the Architects and Engineers.  We are asking for the prime to be knowledgeable about the form. We know there is no project information at this point. Future projects may require all parties on a project to have this completed and passed prior to performance. Anyone who could not pass the security check(s) would not be able to perform on the project and could affect award of a task order.  The government would help process the form but the A&E employees and subcontractors would fill in a majority of the information.  <br> Question 4: Can the four contract vehicles be used by other DoD entities within the state such as the Navy or Corps?   <br> Answer 4: I don't believe any non DOD entities will be utilizing our contracts. No requests have been made of us so far.  If that were a future need it will be discussed with any of the awardees at that time and would be considered a special circumstance.  <br> Question 5: Is this contract requiring 100 % utilization within the State exclusive to only TN Air and Army NG activities?   <br> Question 5: Four contracts will be awarded. Submit for each area you wish to perform services. The areas are labeled: Army, Knoxville, Memphis, and Nashville. LABEL each submission by the area.   <br> Question 6: Does each of the 3 geographic areas represent the ANG work and Army represents statewide Army NG work? <br> Answer 6: This is a description of area as a general rule, but a contracting officer decides who receives award of a task order.    <br> Question 7: Will there be four separate COTRs, one for each contract vehicle?  <br> Answer 7: We use the acronym COR, contracting officer's representative, they are all skilled technically. The answer to the question is no. there are more than four CORs. Your contact for this synopsis and in the event you receive an award will be Terri Baxter unless otherwise notified.  <br> Question 8: Are the awards to be only to one AE firm, exclusively, as opposed to a mix and match of the four finalists? <br> Answer 8: We can have one to four contractors. The A&E who applies for multiple areas would need to explain how they intend to meet all the requirements simultaneously and for a long term basis.  <br> Question 9: Clarification: is the $10M cumulative for all four contracts? Or is $10M per each of four contract vehicles?  <br> Answer 9: Each award is $10Million. Even if one contractor received award for all the areas they would have four separate awards which would then total $40 Million. Multiple submissions require explanation of how the contractor will meet expectations of all requirements simultaneously and for a long term basis.  <br> Question 10: The referenced RFQ states that the Small Business size standard is $14.0 million for NAICS 541330, which applies to Engineering Firms.  If an architectural firm was to be prime, would the same $14.0 million threshold apply for a small business, or would architects still fall under NAICS 541310, which is $7.0 million? Both NAICS codes are referenced in the RFQ? <br> Answer 10: First, this is NOT an RFQ or an RFP. This is a synopsis; a request for submissions to be vetted to the next part of the process. The highest rated contractors will be asked to be interviewed. The successful contractor(s) will receive a solicitation to provide more information which includes burdened pricing rates, G&A, profit, etcetera.  <br>  Second, the NAIC code is for the prime contractor submitting. This request is unrestricted which means large and small companies may apply. Architect and Engineering services are important but only one NAICs code can be input.  The requirement states NAICS 541310 which will be verified in SAM for each contractor, https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  Note that the Prime contractor that receives an award will have reporting requirements of subcontractors.  <br> Question 11: Will a DD Form 254 form be required for each subcontractor?  Some of our subs are small business firms and may have trouble acquiring certification.  <br> Answer 11: The DD Form 254 form is not required for this submission. But the contractors/subcontractors that have trouble could have an effect a future award of a task order with security requirements. See Question 2 & 3 for more about  quote mark 254 quote mark  information. <br> Question 12: The Fed Biz Ops announcement for this opportunity has two different due dates: Dec 20 and Dec 18, 2013. Can you please confirm which date is correct? <br> Answer 12: There were two synopsis posted.  The first is W9122L7-14-R-0001 and the second is W912L7-14-R-0001.  The synopsis with the extra 2 is cancelled.  The due date for submissions on the correct synopsis, numbered W912L7-14-R-0001, is changed to December 20, 2013.  <br> Question 13: Can you please clarify  quote mark presolicitation quote mark  phase?   <br> Answer 13: See Question and answer number 10.  <br> Question 14: Is a 10 pitch font required?  It is our understanding that this is a very large font.  Typical SF330 submittals are 10 point fonts. <br> Answer 14: For this synopsis, pitch references font size. The font size required is 10.  <br> Question 15: Can an engineering company with a primary NAICS code of 541330 submit a proposal on this solicitation as they will have a sub with the NAICS code of 541310. And the SAM profile will include both NAICS codes. Please clarify. <br> Answer 15: As long as the NAICs code is on the Prime contractors SAM report you have met the requirement. <br> Question 16: Is this a new requirement or a follow-on effort? If this is a follow-on, would you please provide the incumbent contract information? <br> Answer 16: This is a new requirement. The requirements have changed but the incumbents are Crump, HFR, and C2RL.  No fourth contract for  quote mark Army quote mark  was in place.  <br> End of Questions and Answers for W912L7-14-R-0001. <br>  <br>

SECTION II STATEMENT OF WORK
1. Project Description
The National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is responsible for conducting studies of the exposure of environmental stressors on ecosystem and human health.  Landscape ecology is an interdisciplinary science framework that studies the relationship between spatial patterns of landscape characteristics and conditions of and risks to ecological resources, including forests, rangelands, wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, and urban environmental settings. Local, regional, national, and global economies depend upon both goods and services resulting from ecological resources. Forests provide materials for many different types of paper products; agricultural systems provide food for the world population; coastal waters provide an abundant food resource; wetlands, streams, and rivers provide numerous recreational opportunities. An ecosystem, or landscape, approach provides a comprehensive basis for identifying and evaluating current and historical land use practices. In this study  we are focusing on riparian function which is heavily influenced by the condition of adjacent and upland ecosystems. Analyzing spatial relationships and short- and long-term trends can determine if goals and objectives are being met. It will also determine what changes are needed in moving the ecosystem towards the desired condition and developing future management alternatives.
Disturbance occurring within a watershed or adjacent to a stream corridor typically produces a causal effect, which may permanently alter one or more characteristics of a stream?s function, which depends on vegetation composition, soils and geomorphology and hydrology. Disruption of the natural water cycle will lead to hydrologic alterations such as increased volume and velocity of runoff, frequency of severity of flooding, chemical concentrations, decreases in natural runoff storage capacity in vegetation, wetlands and soil, and reduced groundwater discharge. 
The hydrologic, physical and ecological alterations resulting from terrestrial activity can have a pronounced impact to the natural function of a stream, lake and wetland. Water quality and biological communities are affected if a streams function is impaired. A stream?s shape evolves over time in response to flow and sediment loads. Increased volume and intensity of runoff leads to stream bank erosion resulting in streams becoming straighter, wider and shallower, reducing pool habitat and fish cover, and destroying riparian vegetation.
As a part of this effort, the Environmental Sciences Division is developing specific approaches to  assessing ecological function using Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), State and Tribal Water Quality and Biological Data. 
2. Description of Student Services:
The student will work within a multi-disciplinary research team and will provide technical ecological, Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing support for research projects characterizing the exposure of environmental stressors on riparian systems 
Specific duties will include assisting research staff in (1) Conducting field surveys including monitoring and recording of physical parameters and biological observations on riparian areas; (2) Photographic analysis; (3) Satellite imagery analysis; and (4) Geographic information system (Landscape metric generation) analysis and other duties necessary to carry out the studies.
The student contractor shall perform duties, as requested, according to specifications and instructions provided by the mentor. Where appropriate, the student contractor shall maintain careful and accurate records in designated laboratory notebooks.  These notebooks and all other data produced under this order will be the property of the Environmental Protection Agency.  All necessary instructions and training will be provided by the EPA mentor. As indicated in the Statement of Work, the student contractor may be expected to participate in conferences and seminars.   
3.  Required Expertise, Skills, Education and/or Experience:  
The student needs to have completed two years of college in biology, ecology, environmental science, zoology or a related field.  The preferred student will have training and/or experience in general Geographic Information Systems techniques, environmental studies, or Remote Sensing. The student will need to know basic field study safety requirements and will be given additional safety training at the Environmental Sciences Division.
4. Required Background Investigation and Suitability Determination:
 Student contractors awarded a contract will have to undergo a background investigation, a check of FBI fingerprint files, and a suitability determination by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Upon receipt of the contract award, go immediately to link http://cdx.epa.gov/warning.asp and register with the Central Data Exchange (CDX) and complete the iBoard application.  Notify the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) as soon as this process is completed. The student contractor must review and complete the requirements before beginning work on-site at the EPA.  If a background check reveals information to indicate the student contractor represents a risk to the interests of EPA and the national security, the contract may be terminated.
Students or recent graduates, who are EPA ORD employees, or the spouse or child of an EPA ORD employee, are not eligible to participate.
5.  Description of Working Conditions:

<a href="mailto:jani.c.long@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Walla Walla</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking interested bidders for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Juvenile Fish Collection Channel Reservoir Side Fish Slot Lower Concrete Plugs. The construction will occur at the Lower Granite Dam in Garfield County, near Pomeroy, Washington.  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  Construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.  <br>  <br> This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify small businesses with the interest in and capability to accomplish the work. This is not a solicitation. <br>  <br> 1) A capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this scope, magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel. Include a list of projects with descriptions that are similar in nature. <br> 2) A statement of your firm's bonding capacity. <br> 3) A statement of your firm's business size and type. <br>  <br> Submit this information to Jani Long, Contract Specialist, via email to jani.c.long@usace.army.mil. <br> Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM on December 17, 2013. <br>  <br> Summary of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> Permanent closure of the reservoir side fish slots use the existing fish screen structures and are converted into fish slot plugs. The screens are removed from the slot by the Corps using their existing lifting beam and crane. Once the screens are out of the slot, they are turned over to the Contractor, the existing screen legs are strengthened, the pervious areas of the screens are lined, and the screen is filled with concrete and reinforcing to create a solid plug. About 378 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 plugs.   <br>  <br> The new concrete is extended above the top of the existing screen framework to facilitate sealing to the side walls of each slot. New lifting hardware is incorporated into the concrete fill, and reinsertion into the slot is accomplished by the Contractor with a Contractor furnished crane. <br>  <br> After the screen plug has been lowered into the slot, divers are deployed in the slot to the top of the screen plug. The lifting line is released by the divers and backer rod sealing material is placed in the gap between the plug and the walls of the slot. The backer rod material is pushed down about 6 inches from the top of the slot plug all around the perimeter. After the backer rod material is in place, the divers place a cementitious grout into the slot all around up to the top of the plug. Once the grout has been placed and has hardened, reinforcing steel is installed into the threaded couplers on the top of the slot plug. The side walls of the slot are pressure washed to remove any biological growth or film in preparation for placing a minimum of 5 feet of tremie concrete on top of the plug. About 324 cy of tremie concrete fill is required for the 18 slots.  <br>  <br> Permanent closure of the Wagner Horn slots uses a precast insert with an integral bottom form grouted into the bottom of the Wagner Horn slot.  About 54 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 slots (54 wagner horn openings).  A roughly 6-foot tall, 30-inch diameter, precast plug of concrete with integrated reinforcing, bottom form, and grout injection ports is anticipated for this closure. The existing Wagner Horn screen will be lowered from deck level using the cables that currently attach the screen to the dam. After the screen is removed, a new high strength cable and sheave will be pulled down into the slot conduits using the existing screen attachment cable.  <br>  <br> Divers will remove the original screen and cable assembly, pressure wash the corrugated inside walls of the conduit, and attach the precast plug to the sheave. The new cable will then be used to pull the precast plug into the Wagner Horn conduit and seat the integrated form against the roof of the intake tube. The divers will then connect to one or more of the grout injection ports provided on the form and fill the annular space between precast plug and the existing interior conduit walls. Once the grout has sufficiently hardened, the injection ports can be removed from the forms and the area ground smooth by divers while the new cable is retracted from the abandoned sheave.  <br>  <br> The anticipated period of performance is July 2014 - March 2015.

<DESC>The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Forces Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) located in Huntsville, Alabama, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) (Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B)), intends to execute without competition a bilateral contract modification under contract W9113M-09-D-0001 (sole source, Modification 0008) to Johns Hopkins University Applied Research Laboratory (JHU/APL) to increase the current contract program ceiling amount (see details below).  The address for this organization is 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099; Cage Code 88898. <br><br>A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, as codified by 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3)(B), authorizes non competitive contracts with educational institutions where necessary to establish or maintain essential engineering, research, and/or development capabilities. JHU is an approved University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) as authorized by the above statute and referenced in Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) UARC management plan dated 1 May 1996 and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEASYSCOM) ltr 5450 Ser 106/08-002 dated 30 October 2007.  The JHU, as a UARC, may not compete against industry in response to competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs) for development or production that involve engineering expertise developed or sustained through this contract action in accordance with statute 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B).  This acquisition may receive a combination of both competitive and non-competitive funding from various Department of Defense (DoD) agencies under the authority previously cited. <br><br>JHU possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities and has been involved in broad programs of long term research and development of major DoD systems.  The scope of the tasks performed under this contract extend across several areas of science and technology to include many different warfare elements, and involve various types of activities from basic research, development, test and evaluation, systems innovations, integration and engineering in support of the DoD's warfighting capabilities. <br><br>The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition).  The contract type will remain Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), not to exceed five years from the original date of award, 23 Feb 2009 through the curretn period of performance 22 Feb 2014.  The original contract action was awarded for $9.8M, a modification added $68.7M on 2 Mar 2011, and this modification will add $85.49M in ceiling to the contract, for a total IDIQ contract valued at $163.99M. <br><br>This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. <br><br>The POC for this action is Timothy Mickelson, Contracting Officer, telephone number 256-955-4167 of FAX number 256-955-4240.

<p>Residential services include care, custody, control, accountability, and treatment, including subsistence. The services described shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, August 2007; Revision 01, December 2007, CCB; Revision 02, December 2008, CCB; Revision 03, February 2010, CCB; Revision 04, May 2010, CCB; Revision 05, May 2011, CCB; Revision 06, January 2012, RRMB; Revision 07, February 2012, RRMB."</p>

Line Item 3 (for the quantities listed below) is unrestricted and can be awarded to either small business concerns or to other than small business concerns.</p>
<p>For each line item, the services are estimated to be 80% male and 20% female for the one-year base period and for each of the four, one-year option periods for the guaranteed minimums; and 79% male and 21% female for the one-year base period and for each of the four, one-year option periods for the estimated maximums.</p>

If (an) award(s) is/are made, Line Item 1 and/or Line Item 2 will be awarded to a single small business concern offeror or multiple small business concern offerors.

For Line Items 1 and 2, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reserves the right to make one single award or multiple awards of up to no more than two awards to meet the requirements. Regardless of the number of contracts, staffing must fall within the guidelines of at least a major use facility, as outlined in the Statement of Work.</p>

<p><br />The Pre-Solicitation Notice posted on May 15, 2012 is hereby modified as follows:</p>
<p>1. The third paragraph is changed to read as follows:</p>

<DESC>The 182nd Airlift Wing, Peoria, Illinois intends on procuring Bulk Concentrate SAE AMS 1424 Propylene Glycol-Based Type 1 Fluid UCAR PG a type of Type 1 deicing fluid with delivery occurring at the 182nd Airlift Wing, Peoria, IL 61607. Approximately $50,000.00 per year for this product, delivered on site within three days of receipt of order. This deicing product (blend/mix) is the only one that meets the environmental requirement based on the active and inactive ingredient mixture that is used in the deicing fluid. Air Force Technical Order 42C-1-2 states the deicing tankers cannot be brought down to the 10% level. This 10% level would be required to permit the use of a new chemical manufacturer without creating a critical and hazardous situation with incoming and outgoing aircraft during the winter environment. If the Government were to accept other companies deicing mixtures it would require a significant purge of the concentrate already in use within the storage tank and delivery vehicles. This would cause waste of any product that is left over. The new deicing fluid's chemical components would need to be reviewed by the ESOMIS to ensure that the mixture of the previous deicing fluid and the new deicing fluid wouldn't cause a potentially hazardous environment for personnel. Additionally, the manpower to conduct the purge and cleanup would incur additional costs and delays. Finally, there would be additional costs in re-labeling all container storage, implementing new usage guidelines, and re-training of all aircraft technicians that maintain deicing duties. Ascent Aviation Group has been the only company to provide this supply as exhibited through procurement history (J&amp;A attached.) Interested parties may identify their interest in, and capability to respond to future requirements of this nature by submitting documentation indicating their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact no later than 27 December 2013. The information received will be considered solely for informational purposes and the Government will not pay for such information received. Point of Contact: Contracting Officer MSgt Ben Yeutson via email at benjamin.yeutson@ang.af.mil or Base Contracting Officer SMSgt Melissa J. Grice via email at melissa.grice@ang.af.mil.

<AWDNBR>W91YU014PXXXX
<AWDDATE>122013
<ARCHDATE>01102014
<DESC>This request is for a follow-on four month short term contract to InfoMedia Group, Inc. (CAGE:  31JY4), to provide four months of Tele-Nurse Triage Services at Irwin Army Community Hospital (IACH), Fort Riley, Kansas for the period of 01 January 2014 through 30 April 2014.  This contract will be a firm-fixed priced award and will mirror the three month short term extension of services on the current Purchase Order (W81K04-09-P-0258).  There will be no option period or an extension of services.  This bridge contract will provide for complete Tele-Nurse Triage Services to assist in the Clinical Operations and Support Division by providing clinical assessments and appropriate level of care support.  InfoMedia Group, Inc. utilizes the current guidelines in the McKesson Care Enhanced Call Center that have been approved by IACH's Medical Staff, which is a big plus for both the IACH facility and their patients.  InfoMedia Group, Inc. provides 24/7 coverage which is extremely beneficial to IACH's patients.  By continuing services with the current Contractor, who already has well qualified/working providers, the government will continue to receive these uninterrupted critical services.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $93,898.00.  Currently there is a mandatory MEDCOM region wide contract being put in place to fulfill this type of requirement; however, to date, the award has not been made.  The services are currently being provided under Purchase Order W91YU0-09-P-0258, which is set to expire 31 December 2013.  Therefore, this contract is being extended only until the MEDCOM enterprise-wide nurse advice line contract is awarded to ensure continuity of these critical healthcare services.  Based on the preceding facts, there is not enough time to solicit for this four month requirement without a break in services.  In light of the continued need for military personnel around the world, the loss of military Physicians due to deployments at IACH, and the continual influx of both Soldiers and their dependents in need of these services, additional Nurse Triage Services are critical.  Any attempt to re-compete the requirement at this late date will cause a lapse in service.  InfoMedia Group, Inc. has provided exceptional services since 2009.  By continuing services with the current contractor who already has well qualified and working providers, the Government will receive uninterrupted services.
