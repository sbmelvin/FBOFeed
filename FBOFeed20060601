<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) anticipates entering into non-competitive negotiations with the University of Colorado (CU) located at the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, Colorado, for approximately 12,608 useable square feet of office, conference, light industrial, and storage space and approximately 9,998 useable square feet of laboratory space.  The subject space will be in support of ongoing cooperative projects between USGS and the University of Colorado.  The space will be located directly on the University of Colorado campus at 3215 Marine Street, Building RL-6, Boulder.  USGS and CU routinely collaborate on projects associated with the toxic substances hydrology program, the water-energy-biogeochemical budgets program, and the national water quality assessment program.  Projects benefiting USGS by working directly at the CU campus include joint publications on hydrologic processes and geochemical thermodynamics and collaborative grants for joint research.  Co-location of USGS and CU scientists working jointly on these projects will greatly enhance their ability to share information and ideas which in turn will result in better scientific understanding of the processes being studied.  Other benefits include USGS participation in CU graduate programs as both students and instructors.  On-site shared resources available to USGS personnel at the CU campus include within one-block access to the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) center and access within the proposed building to sub-zero deep freeze facilities.  Other on-site shared resources include the Geology Department's Thin Section laboratory, the CU chemistry department machine shop, the CU academic libraries, and CU environmental management services.  The lease term will be five years, one year firm.  Suppliers who believe they can provide the required space with the same university privileges are invited to submit an affirmative response by July 3, 2006.  All such responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether that supplier has full knowledge and capabilities to meet requirements of the USGS.  An affirmative response should be provided to the point of contact listed in this announcement.  This notice is for information purposes only.  Requests for Proposal (RFP) are not available.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Cangene Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only responsible source and 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
A contract was awarded, to Cangene Corporation, in January 2003, as a result of a competitive procurement for the production of botulinum antitoxin.  To date the contractor has developed Assays and conducted the necessary Pilot Runs (4).  As a direct result of the Sept. 1, 2001 tragedy and the increase in threat of bioterrorist activities against the United States (U.S.), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventon (CDC) has a need to contract for additional botulinum antitoxin in addition to the botulinum antitoxin that will be produced under the contract described above.  The DHHS and CDC has a need to contract with an experienced firm that possesses the capability and capacity for the production, licensure, and delivery of up to 200,000 doses of Despeciated Heptavalent Botulinum Immune Globulin (BIG) for use as a Heptavalent investigational product under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and to develop a strategy to license the product that is produced.  The contractor will also be responsible for monitoring the potency of the BIG product for an extended period of time.
At the time of award, the prospective contractor must possess the necessary capability and capacity required for cGMP production and licensure and all FDA validation production requirements. The FDA has now determined that both sets of plasma (the January 2003 Cangene contract and the resulting contract for an additional 200,000 doses as described above) can go under one license.

RFP 2006-Q-08507 will be for services effective approximately October 1, 2006 (to replace contract #200-2001-00110, awarded to the nonprofit organization Academy for Education Development in the amount of $3,662,794.00, expiring September 30, 2006).

HSCG40-06-Q-41029


This acquisition is subject to Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Solicitation, Evaluation, and Award procedures of FAR Parts 13.106-1, 13.106-2, and 13.106-3 apply. 

The Coast Guard Engineering Logistics center intends to procure TWO Crankshafts (used on the PAXMAN 16RP200M Engine). NSN: 2815-99-810-6101. This acquisition is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with contractors who can provide CERTIFIED AUTHENTIC OEM Parts.

This will be other than full and open competition using OEM Man B&W Diesel. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Man B&W Diesel parts are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEM. Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition, as they are available from one source. However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The procurement involves parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer of its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows: (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or primary equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts The submission of technical data packages for review shall not impede the award.  It is the government’s belief that only Man B&W Diesel., the manufacturer of the crankshafts and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components. The United States Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the parts of an alternate product. Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussion capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement. No cost or pricing information is required. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited. Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements. Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Samantha Watts Purchasing Agent (CODE 044).  

A solicitation will be release on or about April 27th, 2006.

CVs giving evidence of the required expertise and qualifications should be submitted with the bid as part of the Technical Specifications.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to North Atlantic Industries, 170 Wilbur Place, Bohemia, New York 11716 for the acquisition of two (2) Azimuth Synchro Modules, PN: 824000, and six (6) Synchro-Digital PCI cards, PN: 64CS3-80CSA8-02.  The equipment will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  North Atlantic Industries is the sole manufacturer of this equipment.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has passed environmental and shock testing with these parts installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts.  This would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.!    Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the equipment is acquired from North Atlantic Industries.  FSC code is 7021, NAICS code is 334111, small business standard is 1,000 employees.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Water Recovery Systen Rack #2 Rack Structural Comparative Analaysis. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from The Boeing Company on a sole source basis. The Boeing Company developed the original rack structural analysis for WRS #2.	Since Boeing developed the rack structure model and has the detailed analysis data they can perform the analysis for less cost than using another source.	 MSFC’s engineering directorate indicated that it would take more time for them to perform the analysis since they would have to spend time to understand the Boeing analysis methods prior to being able to start an analysis incorporating the configuration change than to have Boeing perform the work. Please review attached statement of work.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Judith Drabkin at Judith.R.Drabkin@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 CST p.m. local time on June 09, 2006.

Dr. Dambrosia will provide expert statistical consultation and collaboration to Clinical Neuroscience Program (CNP) clinical neuroscience researchers on data analysis, modeling, and inferential interpretation of CNP studies; collaborate with the clinical researchers in the preparation and drafting of manuscripts for publication of the scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals; work with the clinical researchers to respond in writing to questions and comments regarding statistical issues raised by journal referees; and participate as a as statistical reviewer of submitted clinical protocols.  In addition, he will provide CNP clinical neuroscience researchers with statistical planning and design expertise in the development of CNP clinical protocols. This includes translation of clinical questions into testable statistical hypotheses with clearly defined and measurable responses and outcomes; recommend appropriate statistical methods for the analysis of the study data and provide power analyses to ensure that the study sample size is sufficient to detect meaningful clinical differences in comparative studies.  Dr. Dambrosia has more than 30 years of experience in the statistical planning, design, data analysis, and implementations of study protocols in clinical neuroscience research at the NIH; is currently involved in the statistical analysis and modeling of data from several neurological research studies; worked on data from a wide range of neurological diseases and has an understanding of the statistical issues involved in analyzing, modeling, and interpreting such data and has provided expert statistical review and consultation on various protocols.  It is essential that CNP have a high level of biostatistical expertise with experience and involvement in all aspects of clinical neuroscience research. This service is required for both the continuation and completion of ongoing clinical research, Protocol 02-N-0142, A Comparison of Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography Using a Head and Neck Coil with Conventional Angiography for the Diagnosis of Vascular Disease from the Aortic Arch through the Circle of Willis and for the development of new research protocols in the CNP.  CNP requires expertise and experience  in the statistical design and evaluation of clinical neuroscience research protocols; statistical analysis and modeling of data from longitudinal natural history studies, case-control studies, and therapeutic clinical trials associated with neurological diseases;  statistical consultation and collaboration on analytic aspects of design, analysis, and statistical interpretation of ongoing and completed clinical neuroscience research studies and statistical review and revisions of the experimental designs of clinical research protocols.  Selection of another source could cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement (FAR 6.302-1 (B)).

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Lic. Oscar Santiago Corzo Cruz, Director General de Transporte Ferroviario y Multimodal, Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes, Nueva York No. 115, P.H., Col. Napoles, 03810, Mexico, D.F., Phone: (011-52-55) 5536-7880,  Fax: (011-52-55) 5682-5873, E-mail: ocorzo@sct.gob.mx, eescam@sct.gob.mx     The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Master Plan for Multimodal Corridors (Master Plan) Project.

In June 2004, twenty-two public and private organizations met with Mexican President Vicente Fox in to sign a collaboration agreement to promote the development of multimodal corridors in Mexico.  The goal of this agreement was to increase economic competitiveness via the coordination of the connected parties responsible for the facilitation and development of logistic links within and outside Mexico. With the strong commitment of the private sector to this Project, the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), the Ministry responsible for the Mexican transportation sector, took the lead in moving this agenda forward.

The SCT requested funding from U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for a Master Plan that will assist in the planning and promotion of Mexico’s commercial transportation system and the infrastructure that can support increased volumes of trade between Mexico, the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.  The proposed Master Plan is intended to provide a “road map” for the SCT and private sector transportation and logistics providers as to what is required to improve Mexico’s transportation infrastructure so as to realize a more efficient and cost effective supply chain.  The objective of the Master Plan is to provide the SCT with a strategic vision for multimodal transportation linkages, and in turn, Mexico’s freight transportation and logistics service providers and customers with a blueprint for future investment.

The scope of this technical assistance will include an analysis of the main cargo origins and destinations; an analysis of current inter-modal infrastructure, services and equipment in Mexico; an assessment of the potential multimodal corridors in Mexico and their international connection; an assessment of requirements of infrastructure, equipment, services and facilities for the development of multimodal corridors; the development of a tool to evaluate the performance and competitiveness of the multimodal corridors in operation; as well as an economic and social impact assessment of the multimodal corridors at the regional, municipal, state, national and international levels.  This Technical Assistance will enable the SCT to compare national and international systems, assist Mexico in developing a more competitive transportation network.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,323,900 dollar grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and an edited compilation of two Definitional Mission final reports are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<SUBJECT>66--Laser Stage
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-06-821-3614

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD), on behalf of the Nanoscale Metrology Group, Scanning Electron Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with E. Fjeld Co, Inc. of North Billerica, MA, for the purchase of a Laser Interferometer Stage.

The mission of the Nanometer-Scale Dimensional Metrology Group (Precision Engineering Division) is to provide the foundation of dimensional measurement that meets the needs of the U.S. industrial and scientific communities by conducting        research in dimensional measurements, developing measurement methods, providing measurement services and disseminating the resulting technology and length-based standards. 

The acquisition of a second laser interferometer sample stage is necessary to realize traceability on the dimensional measurements done with the FEI Dual-beam scanning electron microscope (SEM). 

Purchase Order Number SB1341-03-N-1895 was awarded, in September 2003, to FEI Company under full and open competition, for the purchase of a NOVA 600 NanoLab No Charge (LoVac) Dual Beam System with a Laser Stage.  This instrument incorporated advanced laser interferometry in the specimen stage to accurately track the X and Y motion of the stage.  

FEI Company subcontracted with E. Fjeld Company to build the laser stage.  FEI and Fjeld collaborated and shared technology to modify Fjeld’s commercial laser stage.  The result was a laser stage that integrated with the scanning electron microscope manufactured by FEI.

The equipment being procured, a Lasertrace 50 Laser Interferometer Controller X-Y Stage, is a drop in replacement for the existing laser stage.  It must integrate into the 
SEM, be 100% interchangeable with the existing stage, and provide the identical tests and data as the existing stage.

Sole source determination is based on the following:  The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  Fjeld has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to Fjeld. Fjeld has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide this equipment.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 15, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

THE PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS

1) GENERAL

To enhance competition, ensure quality performance, and to obtain the best value for our purchasing dollars, it is Postal Service policy to pre-qualify commercial suppliers whenever practical. (USPS Supplying Principles and Practices, Step 2 – Evaluate Sources.)  In addition to its effects on competition and performance, pre-qualification can also shorten purchase lead time and strengthen relations between the Postal Service and its suppliers.

Competition is enhanced through identification of – and competition among – suppliers who can demonstrate a capacity to provide quality products and services in a timely manner.  Marginal suppliers who are not pre-qualified for a requirement will be saved the time and expense of preparing proposals that do not have a reasonable chance for award.

Lead time is shortened because there are fewer competitors.  Evaluation teams will save time by evaluating proposals form only the most qualified suppliers.  The evaluation process will focus on proposals submitted by those suppliers most qualified to meet the Postal Service’s requirements.  Pre-qualified suppliers are more likely to provide quality proposals.

Relationships are strengthened by establishing partnerships with a smaller, more quality-focused supplier base.  Longer-term relationships will enhance mutual understanding and better communication and coordination with and between the Postal Service and its supplier.

Pre-qualified suppliers are firms or individuals whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards of quality and reliability.  A supplier demonstrates the ability to perform to consistently high standards through a record of excellent past performance.  Quality may be demonstrated by previously providing high quality supplies or services, and by maintaining a documented quality system.  Reliability may be demonstrated through consistent on-time delivery, as well as through supplies that perform well throughout their anticipated service life.

2) PROCESS DETAILS

The Postal Service intends to pre-qualify suppliers that meet the qualification, financial capability, experience, and past performance as stated.  An evaluation team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this prequalification package.  To receive maximum credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit the adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will be reflected in the evaluation scoring.

Prequalification of suppliers takes place prior to a formalized solicitation process.  Prequalification identifies suppliers with proven records of capability, quality, and reliability; and, eliminates suppliers that are not the “best-in-class”.

After the evaluation team has reviewed and analyzed the supplier, based on predefined evaluation capabilities and criteria, suppliers are placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers need not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines (1) that a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding purchasing opportunities for the less qualified.  During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured:

1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively.
2.	That the inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier is based on business decisions alone, and that it is judged solely on the predetermined prequalification method.
3.	An adequate number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate competition for subsequent purchases.
4.	 Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier is sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The Postal Service will notify all parties within 30 days from receipt of their documentation as to the status of the prequalification proceedings.

The prequalification process does not constitute an assurance that we will issue a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, when or if an RFP is issued, it will only be provided to those suppliers on the prequalification list.

3) Timeframe
THE PREQUALIFICATION LIST WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006. 

The selection process will be performed in compliance with the guidelines contained in Process Step 2 – Evaluate Sources, part of USPS Supplying Principles and Practices.  The Supplying Principles and Practices are available to the public at www.usps.com.

Part I – Introduction and Purpose
1) Overview

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is taking a phased approach to meeting the DHS HSPD-12 policy.  The USPS will initially deploy HSPD-12 compliant cards to employees and Suppliers who need access to Government facilities and assess the feasibility of implementing standard access control technologies at USPS facilities.  The USPS will also make a determination as to the extent to which logical access control can be integrated with physical access control.  To govern the multiple program phases necessary to meet this policy, a USPS Program Management Office (PMO) will be established to provide program oversight.  The purpose of the PMO is to provide oversight of the planning, execution, and control of projects, which together serve to implement the requirements of HSPD-12.  The USPS Inspection Service is chartered as the lead organization for the development of the HSPD-12 PMO.  Upon establishment of the HSPD-12 PMO, the PMO will support the acquisition of an HSPD-12 systems integrator during FY07.  

The mission of the PMO is to enable and coordinate activities to meet deployment milestones and monitor program progress.  The USPS HSPD-12 PMO will be a management entity comprised of USPS and Supplier staff supported by an infrastructure of management and business technology resources.  The HSPD-12 PMO is separate from, but shall provide oversight of, the systems integrator who will develop and implement the HSPD-12 solution. 

The USPS implementation of HSPD-12 is focused on three initial phases:  1) issuing Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards; 2) evaluating and implementing standard physical access control technologies; and 3) evaluating solutions to utilize logical access control. The first phase will focus on issuing the PIV cards to approximately 30,000 USPS Federal employees, and pilot integration with physical access control at five sites.  After the initial issue of the prototype PIV cards, the USPS will issue PIV cards to the remaining Federal employees and Suppliers at other selected facilities.  The second phase of the USPS HSPD-12 implementation will be to evaluate standard physical access control technologies for existing and new facilities.  Once a solution is selected, the USPS will procure and implement the physical access control solution.  The third phase of the USPS HSPD-12 implementation will be to begin the process of evaluating solutions to utilize logical access control.
Part 2 - Supplier Requirements.
1) Evaluation Criteria

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

CDC is seeking small businesses capable of proposing on an incrementally-funded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a five (5) year period of performance beginning October 1, 2006, under NAICS Code 541720.  The existing contract #200-2001-00110, awarded to the Academy for Education Development in the amount of $3,662,794.00, expires September 30, 2006.  The date specified for receipt of proposals will be approximately 30 days after the issue date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) 2006-Q-08507, which is anticipated to be issued on or about May 12, 2006.  The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.  All responsible small businesses may respond to this notice and provide their experience and information on similar contracts performed by emailing Sam Jamison: esw2@cdc.gov. 

Background:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) seeks to prevent the most serious health risk behaviors among children, adolescents and young adults.  To accomplish this mission DASH implements four strategies: 1) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors and school health policies and programs to address them throughout the United States and its territories; 2) synthesizes research findings to identify policies and practices that are most likely to be effective in promoting healthy behaviors among young people. Research-based recommendations for school health programs are featured in a series of publications called the CDC guidelines for school health; 3) funds programs to enable its constituents to implement adolescent and school health programs; and 4) provides evaluation technical assistance (TA) to funded Non-Government Organizations and state and local agencies to help them evaluate the quality and effectiveness of their school health policy development and implementation, curriculum design, professional development activities, and program impact on students.  Most causes of health threats to children and youth are related to six behaviors including: (1) tobacco use; (2) dietary patterns that contribute to disease; (3) insufficient physical activity; (4) sexual behaviors that result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and unintended pregnancy; (5) alcohol and other drug use; and (6) behaviors that result in unintentional injuries and violence.

Description of Work:
The Contractor, in collaboration with DASH and other contractors (including but not limited to those providing programmatic or technical services), shall (1) provide intensive program evaluation TA (ITA) by phone, e-mail, or in-person to selected DASH-funded partners; (2) develop and assess the usefulness of evaluation resources, reports, and tools (electronic, for presentation, and in print) to aid funded partners in conducting program evaluations through clear and consistent ITA messages; (3) promote, market and assess the usefulness of evaluation TA activities to DASH funded partners through development and distribution of marketing materials; (4)  plan, develop, implement, and follow-up on evaluation workshops and trainings as requested; and (5) develop and/or maintain a system by which records of program evaluation ITA will be shared with DASH staff, contractors, and funded partners.

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 
 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The US Army ARDEC-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential  sources for supplying the U.S. Army with the establishment of the Center for  Integrated Security Logistics. The requirement for this award is to establish a  Center for Integrated Security Logistics and begin the process of developing  four components that will dramatically improve the Office of Homeland Defense  ability to respond to emergency events via a more secure logistics supply chain  as well as have application to similar problems encountered by the Army's  ammunition distribution mission.  The four systems are: a) HSMS, a low-cost,  high reliability health and status monitoring system (HSMS) as a safeguard  against specific environmental degradations; b) IAS, an Intelligent Asset system  (IAS) for real-time inventory of assets; c) AAC, a real-time AIT concept to  enable total Asset Accountability/Consumption (AAC) down to the emergency  response system.  Enables on location visibility of shipped assets; and d) AAL,  an Anticipatory (Sense and Respond) Asset Logistics Portal (AALP) for responsive  end-to-end supply chain. All of these proposed systems will be demonstrated at  Homeland Defense exercises planned for the next FY. This approach will also be  tailored to support similar visibility and accountability problems with the  Army's ammunition supply chain and demonstrated at various ammunition supply  point nodes.  Delivery is planned for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2007.   The Government intends to award on sole source basis, a contract to University  of Maryland, Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise, School of Public  Affairs. Respondents should have sufficient capability to furnish these  requirements to the U.S. Army.  Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are  invited to indicate their interest by providing to the U.S. Army a brief  summary of their companyâ€™s capabilities including brief description of  facilities, personnel, and past experience. A follow-up detailed questionnaire  may be provided to survey respondents and on-site visits may be performed as a  result of further analysis. Also, interested firms should provide the name,  address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address, size of  business (small/large) and where the facility is located.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The DOI intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services. The Department of the Interior (DOI) is performing market research on Knowledge Base (KB) software that can provide comprehensive and streamlined access to resources which support geospatial activities across all DOI bureaus.  There are approximately 75,000 employees in the DOI of which about 13,000 use GIS software and geospatial data on a regular basis to perform their bureau's mission critical duties.  The eight bureaus in DOI each provide internal GIS software support involving technical applications, software deployment, licensing and general support for a variety of geospatial data formats. The KB content will include resources from past, present, and future DOI bureau level internal GIS Help Desk activities, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), code samples, scripts, spatial modeling applications, geospatial standards and policies, training materials, white papers and other assorted documentation.  The ideal solution would also provide capabilities for simultaneously searching on external sources such as commercial GIS software support resources.  The KB solution should provide the ability to load existing content into a KB repository, and/or access the content in its current location.  If the data must be loaded into a repository, functionality for batch loading of content is preferred, due to the volume of content across the bureaus.  Role-based access to the KB must be made available to all DOI employees and contractors, and meet Federal security guidelines.  Authorized users must also be able to upload and download selected content to and from the site. Firms which believe they can provide the above are invited to submit an affirmative response by close of business on July 14, 2006. An affirmative response shall include a brief description of the solution which will meet the capabilities described herein as well as a high level explanation of the solution architecture (e.g. web-based solution accessing content on a file server or desktop solution connected to an RDBMS, etc.).  This summary should not exceed three pages in length.  The firm should also be able to provide any literature, brochures, and other such information which demonstrates the vendor's ability to provide the required services.   Questions and all responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Melissa Gill, via e-mail to mgill@usgs.gov and for brochures that are not available electronically, mail to the attention of Melissa Gill at U. S. Geological Survey, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, MS 205, Reston, Virginia 20192.  Responses are due no later than close of business on July 14, 2006.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (extension optional) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Program Description

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia has responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics. This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Within the USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia the Office of Health and Education (HE) has the primary responsibility for management of assistance in the social sectors, primarily health reform, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  USAID/HE serves as the primary point of communication on these sectors with the governments of the five Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan); five U.S. Embassies in Central Asia; non-governmental organizations (indigenous, U. S., international); other donors and private commercial entities. USAID is funding activities in public health care reform (which includes health financing, policy, and systems reform); infectious disease prevention and control (tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and avian influenza); and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  

USAID/CAR’s strategic objective in health is: Increased utilization of quality primary health care in selected populations.  This objective is achieved through four intermediate results: (1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; 
(2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; (3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care and (4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework. 

A major challenge in the region is to a) restructure the public health sector to focus on primary health care; b) reduce the burden of disease caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, acute respiratory infection, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, etc; and c) improve the quality of primary health care services to address the high mortality and morbidity caused by diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and other lifestyle related diseases which are observed in more developed countries.  

B)	STATEMENT OF DUTIES

OBJECTIVE

Under the general supervision of the Office Director, Office of Health and Education, the Contractor will serve as USAID/CAR’s Regional Public Health Management Specialist for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.  The Contractor will provide USAID/CAR with technical and analytical support in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the health activities that will strengthen the capacity of the CAR governments and non-government organizations (NGOs) to develop and sustain effective health policies, systems and effective, efficient quality service delivery.

The Contractor will play an active role as a team member of the Strategic Objective (S.O.) 3.2 Team.

The date specified for receipt of proposals will be approximately 30 days after the issue date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) 2006-Q-08507, which is anticipated to be issued on or about May 12, 2006.

Background:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) seeks to prevent the most serious health risk behaviors among children, adolescents and young adults.  To accomplish this mission DASH implements four strategies: 1) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors and school health policies and programs to address them throughout the United States and its territories; 2) synthesizes research findings to identify policies and practices that are most likely to be effective in promoting healthy behaviors among young people. Research-based recommendations for school health programs are featured in a series of publications called the CDC guidelines for school health; 3) funds programs to enable its constituents to implement adolescent and school health programs; and 4) provides evaluation technical assistance (TA) to funded Non-Government Organizations and state and local agencies to help them evaluate the quality and effectiveness of their school health policy development and implementation, curriculum design, professional development activities, and program impact on students.  Most causes of health threats to children and youth are related to six behaviors including: (1) tobacco use; (2) dietary patterns that contribute to disease; (3) insufficient physical activity; (4) sexual behaviors that result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and unintended pregnancy; (5) alcohol and other drug use; and (6) behaviors that result in unintentional injuries and violence.

Description of Work:
The Contractor, in collaboration with DASH and other contractors (including but not limited to those providing programmatic or technical services), shall (1) provide intensive program evaluation TA (ITA) by phone, e-mail, or in-person to selected DASH-funded partners; (2) develop and assess the usefulness of evaluation resources, reports, and tools (electronic, for presentation, and in print) to aid funded partners in conducting program evaluations through clear and consistent ITA messages; (3) promote, market and assess the usefulness of evaluation TA activities to DASH funded partners through development and distribution of marketing materials; (4)  plan, develop, implement, and follow-up on evaluation workshops and trainings as requested; and (5) develop and/or maintain a system by which records of program evaluation ITA will be shared with DASH staff, contractors, and funded partners.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services are required for award of up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDIQ) to support the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. The contract will be for a 12 month period and will have options to extend the contract for two additional periods of 12 months each. An option period may be exercised when the contract amounts for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. Contract will be firm fixed priced. The total contract amount will not exceed $1,500,000 and $500,000 per period. Individual task orders will not exceed the $500,000 amount for a period. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Task orders will be assigned based on the A-E's workload, geographic area, specialized experience, customer satisfaction, and project requirements. The concentration of work will be for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, but may be used anywhere within the boundaries of the North East Region as defined by the United States Census Bureau . Contracts may be issued up to one year after the selection is made and will be issued based on the order of ranking of the firms by the selection board.  The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. 2. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: If the selected firm is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan with the final fee proposal will be required. A minimum of 40% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 15% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, 8% with women-owned small businesses (WOSB),   3% shall be placed with Hubzone Small Business (HubSB), and 3% with veteran-owned small businesses. This plan is not required with this submittal.  3. PROJECT INFORMATION: Since opening in April, 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has hosted over two million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibits and public programs are housed in a 258,000 square foot building, which in many ways evokes the Museum's subject matter. The Museum's staff offices are located primarily adjacent to the Museum in the Ross Administrative Center, a 45,000 square foot building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in leased office space elsewhere in the District of Columbia. The Museum also has a remote storage and conservation facility outside of the District of Columbia. It has become apparent that modifications need to be made to accommodate the Museum's expanding collections and developing programs.  There are also a number of maintenance issues caused by the Museum's great success which need to be addressed. The Museum's Division of Operations is looking to issue IDIQ contracts with firms who will be able to make these adjustments in a manner which is architecturally compatible with either the Museum's design aesthetic, or with the historic fabric of the Ross Administrative Center. These contracts will be overseen by the Museum Architect.  As the projects are expected to range considerably in size, scope, and public visibility, it is anticipated that the Museum will establish contracts with multiple firms, at least one of which has an emphasis on historic preservation and materials conservation. The following services are expected to be contracted for as part of these contracts: complete design services including the preparation of construction contract drawings, specifications and cost estimates, both preliminary and final; site investigations; planning studies; preparation of presentation drawings, models, and sample boards; programming; space layouts; tenant space plans; interior design, including furniture and finish selection; shop drawing reviews; value engineering; construction services; post-construction services; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services which may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. Some projects will be initiated as part of this contract, and flow from programming and schematic design through construction documentation. Other projects will be based upon schematic designs provided by the Museum Architect. The firm or firms selected shall have either in-house expertise or consultants with expertise in the following areas:  architectural conservation, museum planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, fire protection engineering, and cost estimating.  Some projects may require specialized expertise in graphic design, architectural lighting, historic preservation, and architectural materials conservation. Additional required expertise may be needed for a specific project, as required by the Government.  The firm or firms selected, and their consultants, shall be licensed to practice their respective disciplines in the District of Columbia. As such, they shall be familiar with all applicable codes, as well as with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.  They shall also be familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, particularly as it relates to the selection of furniture and interior design elements. They shall also be familiar with the procedures and requirements of the National Capitol Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, as well with as the Section 106 Historic Review Process.

<DESC>1.0	SECTION 1: BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1	Scope
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to provide industry with a vehicle to describe solutions and implementation approaches for satellite network communication alternatives in support of the MDRC communication requirements. An MDRC is a recreational vehicle that has been retrofitted with satellite communications that provides voice and data connectivity to the FEMA network and systems including the internet.  The insight gained from this RFI will enable FEMA to incorporate strategies, alternatives, experiences and innovative practices to improve current services and develop and implement a long-term flexible, reliable and cost efficient solution. The ultimate goal is to achieve an optimized MDRC Satellite network communication solution to better serve the citizen during federal disaster recovery efforts. 
Responses to this RFI should be from the perspective of being a satellite service provider. The government does not need at this time, information marketing a firm’s products for use in a common solution. The objectives of this RFI are to: 
•	Determine if options exist to replace the current airtime solution component without disruption to the mission and with maximum re-use of current GFE assets;
•	Solicit information from industry on strategies, alternatives, and experiences in developing and implementing satellite communication solutions in the mid and long term including innovative practices that have been effective in increasing satellite network communication effectiveness and efficiency;
•	Understand options for other satellite airtime alternatives including migration from current solution.
•	Solicit lessons learned from enterprises that have overcome similar challenges as those faced by the government (e.g., remote communications with no land-based communications available); and
1.2	MDRC Overview
The following sections provide insight into FEMA’s mission and how MDRCs are used to achieve this mission.
1.2.1	FEMA Mission
FEMA’s mission encompasses the centralized direction of emergency management in both peacetime and war, for emergencies ranging from natural to man-made disasters.  FEMA executes its responsibilities via ten Regional Offices, five Federal Regional Centers, the Mt. Weather Emergency Assistance Center (MWEAC), the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), the Olney Federal Support Center, and other fixed disaster processing sites. 
1.2.2	The MDRC Fleet and Deployment
FEMA began using Mobile Disaster Recovery Centers (MDRCs) in response to the Florida hurricanes in August and September of 2004 and has since established a fleet of 60 MDRCs that are stationed at four locations throughout the United States.  In November of 2004, On Call Communications, Inc installed satellite systems designed to provide remote voice and data services on ten (10) of FEMA’s MDRCs.  These On Call systems were operational within three weeks and are currently in service providing telephone and secure internet service to the victims of Hurricanes in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama (FEMA Regions IV and VI).  In response to Hurricane Katrina, the FEMA Response Division procured an additional thirty (30) new MDRCs that were also equipped with the satellite communications capability. 
•	MDRCs are deployed rapidly but only on an as needed basis, are on location for varying periods of time, serve a range of constituents, and only will require a communication link that is appropriate to time in the field.  
•	MDRCs are deployable to temporary housing shelters and are capable of providing communications and workstations in Staging Areas, Mobilization Centers, and other command and control centers.
1.2.3	MDRC Communication Environment
The MDRC communication environment constitutes a set of government owned hardware that communicates through a VSAT satellite terminal.  The end-point of communication is the connection to the private fiber which, in turn, establishes a connection to FEMA’s WAN or the Internet.
•	For the purposes of this RFI, “airtime” is hereby defined as the environment contained with in the dotted line areas.  It includes the satellite, the base station (i.e., Current Teleport), the facility to house the base station communication hardware, and the bandwidth (i.e. space segments) provided through the satellite.
•	The “MDRC infrastructure” is inclusive of all communication equipment and services to the demarcation points at the MDRC vehicle and the FEMA WAN entry point.  This includes the airtime portion of the solution.
FEMA hopes to understand if alternatives exist to competitively price airtime in the short term without impacting mission services while also protecting GFE asset investments. 
The following describes the balance of technical components associated with MDRC.
MDRC Unit Components
•	Antenna’s:  .96 and 1.2m Ku Band antennas
•	PCs/Phones/Faxes:  10 PCs, 20 Phones and 1 faxes per MDRC (up to 20 PCs possible).  600 PCs, 1200 Phones, 60 faxes total at peak usage (up to 1200 PCs)

•	Protocols Supported:  SMTP, FTP, and HTTP
•	Uplink Power (Block Converter):  4 & 8 watt block up converters
•	Low Noise Block Converter:  Amplifier and downconverter
Teleport and Satellite
•	Modem:  Comtech Efdata 570
•	General Earth Station RF Equipment
FEMA Regional Office
•	Quintum 24 line:  VOIP
•	Modem:  UD Gateway
1.2.4	General Satellite Communication Service Requirements:
•	Coverage – CONUS plus Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, and Alaska
•	Ku Band services
•	Bandwidth (on demand, guarantee of service, scalable, QOS, traffic shaping)
•	Secure connectivity to FEMA WAN
•	Non-proprietary solutions/services
•	Disaster Recovery, Business Continuity, and Survivability of the entire MDRC infrastructure – providing options to maintain communications with minimal disruption of service

<CONTACT>Marcia Roper - Marcia.Roper.ctr@usmc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is to determine if there are sources capable of satisfying the governments requirement as follows.  THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB) OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  NO PROPOSALS are requested or accepted under this RFI and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  The U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Infantry Weapons Systems, Contract Group, Quantico, VA, is seeking sources that can provide a small arms projectile which is “Blind to Barriers”.  This RFI is specifically targeted to 5.56mm small arms ammunition but may be expanded to other calibers in the future.  Marines in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom frequently have been required to engage enemy combatants in urban areas.  As such, Marines often have to shoot thru various intervening barriers to include automobile glass, automobile doors and common dwelling walls.  It has been observed that current issue 5.56x45mm m!  unitions (M855 ball, M955 armor piercing and MK 262) are severely degraded when impacting these intervening barriers.  This degradation has resulted in a diminished capability to stop the aggressive action of the threat or render him hors de combat.  It is recognized that enemy combatants or other threats are the same physiologically no matter where they are.  Therefore, the USMC desires a small arms projectile which is “Blind to Barriers”.  Recent testing and consultation with the FBI Ballistic Research Facility has revealed that certain projectiles currently exist which are less effected by intermediate barriers than others.  Treaties which the US follows prohibit the use in international armed conflict of small arms projectiles specifically designed to flatten or expand easily in soft tissue upon impact.  It appears a projectile specifically designed to be “Blind to Barriers” would not be contrary to U.S law or policy.  Testing in ten percent ballistic gel likely would s!  how a wound profile comparable to the M855. Any “Blind to Barrier” pro jectile would require a legal review by the Office of Judge Advocate General, in collaboration with CMC-JAO and perhaps the DoD General Counsel.  USMC, Infantry Weapons, Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking information on 5.56 X 45mm ammunition that is blind to barriers as outlined above.  This Request for Information should include all relevant information to include, bullet weight, type construction, any previous testing conducted, pressures, amount of powder, etc.  WRITTEN RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 23 JUNE 2006, 1500 HOURS EASTERN STANDARD TIME.  Please direct all questions regarding this RFI to Ms. Marcia Roper via email at Marcia.Roper.ctr@usmc.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cryogenics Technologies Group, Boulder CO proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Janis Research Company, 2 Jewel Drive, Wilmington, MA 01887-0696 for a cryostat system (SVT-200) needed to cool a small sample to below 2 degrees Kelvin and hold it at that temperature for four hours. The sample can then be probed with a laser through four windows in the outer shell of the cryostat. This system uses a liquid nitrogen dewar surrounding a liquid helium dewar. The liquid helium is metered through a valve and passes across the sample to be studied. Small heaters on the sample holder and on the liquid helium tube precisely control the temperature. This system will allow the study of samples at lower temperatures than NIST's current cryostat systems. NIST requires a flowing vapor type cryostat with self contained liquid nitrogen and liquid helium dewars. The "tail" or sample end of the unit has four windows that are 36.5 mm from the sample and yet the temperature of that sample can be lowered to below 2 degrees Kelvin. This feature is critical because lenses to focus the laser beams must be close to the sample being studied. The four hour hold time below 3 degrees Kelvin is essential for the long run times of experiments and the self-contained liquid cryogens mean that no vibration is introduced from the vibration isolated laser table where the cryostat will be mounted. NIST will build a rotating sample holder inside the cryostat and this model has a hole down the center of the sample holder rod which allows for rotation of the sample holder. The cryostat shall allow the samples to be immersed in liquid helium. Through market research it is known that other companies have flowing vapor cryostats but they do not have the close-in optical access needed.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. No Solicitation is available. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before June 16, 2006. Anticipated award date is June 17, 2006.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR INSIDER THREAT FOCUSED OBSERVATION SOLUTION TO DETECT AUTHORIZED USERS WHO CONDUCT MALICIOUS ACTIVITY WITHIN A NETWORK OR ON A SYSTEM.

SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for an Insider Threat user-focused observation tool that could be deployed on selected host-machines across the DoD.  Traditional efforts to secure Department of Defense (DoD) networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security.  While such defenses as network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, there is an equally damaging threat posed by those who have access to information systems and networks and operate from within.  The activity of the ‘insiders’ would not normally be detected by the security measures in place.  The Insider Threat Focused Observation Tool solution will provide the functional capabilities for more insider aggressive data gathering and analysis technology not normally a part of network management or security.

For the purposes of this RFI, an ‘insider’ is defined as anyone who uses authorized credentials to access a DoD computer and/or network; regardless of whether or not those credentials were acquired through legal channels.

The types of insider activities include: exceeding permissions, conducting malicious activities, providing unapproved access, circumventing security controls, unintentionally damaging resources, and accessing or removing data without authorization or in an inappropriate manner (also referred to as exfiltration).

Under the Insider Threat Focused Observation Tool, solution security products are selectively installed directly on network end-points.  In general, this means installing agent-based tools on targeted host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers).  In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration.  For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used: 

Central Manager: The portion of the solution that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager.  The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of the host agent.  This central manager will reside within the local enclave.

Host Agent: Those tools (or portions of tools), which actually perform the tasks associated with gathering user and system information on host machines.  The local host capability to communicate with the central manager referred as the host-based agent or just agent.  The capabilities could be provided by either a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two.  

DESCRIPTION:

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the acquisition of Insider Threat focused observation capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. 
 
REQUIREMENTS:

This section describes the desired capabilities for the Insider Threat Focused Observation Tool.  A solution with multiple products under a single manager is acceptable for the purpose of this RFI.  Individual products with a subset of these capabilities are also of interest, and vendors and/or government organizations with these solutions are encouraged to respond to this RFI.     

The tool will operate in a controlled environment with access restrictions applied to the data gathered, the tools operation, and the tool’s software elements.  Some of the features include the ability to ensure Confidentiality and Integrity of the software elements through self-protection mechanisms and access controls to limit the users to an identifiable select group.  Additionally, the tool will protect the gathered information from unauthorized access and control its availability to select groups.  All communications will be encrypted.

The tool needs to be scalable to the target community with an expected maximum of deployment, management, and information gathering capability of 250 simultaneous hosts from a single manager. 

The collected data includes host, and user information.  The information includes descriptive data such as: local/network account users and groups; operating systems; time reference; user ID; and the specific type of activity and the users actions during the monitored period.

The tool will provide for self-preservation to include a capability to self-report, to self or operator restart/reinstall for all portions of the system.

The tool will create, maintain, and archive customizable audit logs for all activities to include user, network, system, and tool actions.  Typical collected data includes elements such as: user ID, type of activity, timestamp, unique device ID, process ID, thread ID, and workstation ID.


The tool will provide for customizable alarm generation and notification to the operator.

The user analysis is expected to be based on configurable thresholds, indicators, and pre-defined templates of user-based anomalies and create subject behavior profiles using defined behavior patterns.  

The tool will provide for host machine screen captures and replay those screen captures in a video or movie format.

For follow-on investigation purposes the tool needs the capability to capture, via industry approved methods, forensic data.

The Console Requirements apply to the collector, correlator, and analysis engine or machine used to convert the collected user data into actionable information on specific user activities.

The Console is the central display and interaction point for the gathered data.  The Console requires an operator-friendly display method that facilitates the decision process, provides real-time actionable information, alerts on behavior activities, and controls the interaction (refresh rate, bandwidth, etc…) between all components.

During information gathering the Console is required to gather, display, and alert the operator based on parameters and templates that consist of both pre-defined and operator-configured actions.

The console will correlate and normalize the gathered data allowing attribution of activities to specific users.  

The console will make available operator configured, filtered, decision information for electronic interaction (i.e. data mining and keyword searches), electronic exchange (import/export) through industry standards (CSV, OBDC, XML, etc…), as well as through customized and template reports and alerts.

The solution requirements section applies to the mechanism used to gather the system, network, and user data.  There are three requirements categories used to describe the solution: General; Host; and Device Monitoring.

The General Requirements describe the desired information and operation characteristics of the environment.

The solution will need to be capable of supporting a large number of operating systems employed by DoD.  Among the systems are: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows NT4 (SP6a), SOLARIS, HP-UX, Linux, and other UNIX variants.

The solution must be compatible with and not interfere with other approved CND tools (i.e. Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, and Host-Based Security System (HBSS)).  

The solution will identify and associate the data with the user account information.

The operational characteristics of the solution include the ability to install and operate without the user's knowledge or being flagged by existing host-based CND tools (i.e. Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, and Host-Based Security System (HBSS)).  At a minimum, it must “hide” indications of its presence from the user.

The solution’s operational impact to the users system, in terms of input-output performance, system usability, and functionality, must be negligible.   

Information and data must be protected and preserved using industry standard and business best practices to ensure the security and traceability of the user's actions.

The Host Monitoring capability describes some of the specific activities and data requirements for the DoD environment.

The host sensor monitors and reports all available system data on software and hardware activities associated with system configuration changes, installation, modification, and removal.

The host sensor gathers user account data that identifies and tracks specific user's actions.  The type of data includes local user account modification information, user name, and the user's activities.

The host sensor captures and reports on the underlying Operating System actions associated with inherent features such as cut/copy and paste, drag-and-drop, and Command Line sessions

For all web and Internet connections, the sensor gathers data, and is capable of replaying the activities, for potential misuse through mobile code, such as Java and ActiveX and web browser window actions.  The collected data will be sufficient to rebuild the session to include the associated URL of any visited web page(s).

The host sensor is required to analyze encrypted sessions before encryption or after decryption.

The host sensor needs to distinguish and capture traffic associated with numerous data on services, ports, and protocol use.  Some examples are Voice-Over-IP, TLS, SSL, Rlogin, Xwindows, NNTP exchanges, SNMP exchanges, DNS exchanges, RPC Peer-To-Peer, IMAP, POP, SMTP exchanges, IRC sessions, Instant Messaging, Telnet and FTP.

The Device Monitoring capability refers to capturing specific hardware information and activities typically generated through user interaction with the host.

The solution needs to capture the use of removable, writeable media, regardless of the Operating System format.  Additionally that information will be transferred to a repository (log) and contain specific information associating the media with the information placed on or removed from that media.

The solution needs to capture the transmission of files and messages through network connections.  The network connections, at a minimum, include dial-up modems, Ethernet, and wireless.

For any file operation the solution will record associated file attributes and user actions.

The solution needs to capture the use of detachable devices such as, fire-wire (IEEE 1394) devices (e.g. PDA, printers, etc.), infrared devices, EVDO, WiFI, Bluetooth, parallel port devices, serial port devices, and USB media and devices (e.g. thumb drives, PDA, digital camera, MP3 players).

The solutions monitor and capture actions associated with the use of input/output devices commonly attached to hosts (i.e. keyboard strokes and mouse movements).
The solution will be able to monitor printer activity to include such information as Printer Name, Job ID, printer location, printed document name, source machine information and printed data information, such as text and graphics.

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company is the Management & Operating Contractor for the United States Department of Energy at the Savannah River Site (SRS), located near Aiken, SC.  WSRC is seeking prospective suppliers interested in financing, designing, constructing, starting-up and potentially operating a steam generating facility for the Site’s 200-Areas.  The primary purpose of the steam is for HVAC needs; however, it will also be used for process requirements.   The projected average steam demand will be approximately 115,000 pounds per hour.  Winter peak demands are anticipated to be approximately 204,000 pounds per hour.   The current operating pressure of the export steam system is 385 pounds per square inch gage.   The steam will be saturated.  The facility will be located on SRS property.  Suppliers will likely be responsible for funding modifications to existing steam pressure reducing stations, as needed, if a different pressure steam is proposed.  The supplier will be responsible for evaluating existing systems, structures, and components to ensure that they are not adversely affected by the steam conditions being provided by the new steam facility.  Reliability conditions for the system will require 24 hour-per-day on-site surveillance.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) may be initiated in the near future.  Any subcontract or lease award resulting from a possible request for proposal will be made on a best value basis.  Prospective suppliers are requested to express their interest in writing (e-mail or fax acceptable) to Mr. Lawrence Coffey at the following address no later than 6/30/06.

Washington Savannah River Company
Building 730-4B Rm. 2162
Aiken, SC 29808
Fax No.: (803) 952-6092
E-mail: lawrence.coffey@srs.gov 

An expression of interest must provide the following information: (1) project experience, (2) a list of projects similar in scope and complexity, (3) a description of the likely steam production method(s), and (4) name, address, phone number, e-mail address and fax numbers.  Expressions of Interest (EOI) should be based upon a proven technology that has a history of being permitted in South Carolina by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.

WSRC will provide utilities (electricity, drinking water, and sewer) to the facility.  Raw makeup water can be provided from existing on-Site river water system.  The supplier will be responsible for chemical treatment and water conditioning as required.  The supplier will be responsible for obtaining all necessary SCDHEC construction permits.  If the supplier plans to operate the new facility, they shall be responsible for ensuring that plant is operated within proscribed limits and standards set forth by SCDHEC.  The facility will be added to the SRS Title V air permit, and must meet new source performance standards.  Expressions of interest should discuss plans for disposal of waste generated by boiler operation.  Cooled boiler waste water can be discharged to the sanitary sewer system.  Operator EOIs should be structured such that all raw materials including fuel are purchased by the supplier.  

Although not a requirement, the supplier should consider cogeneration of electricity to supply some or all of the Site’s electrical demand.  This demand will vary between 35-45 MWe.  Cogeneration should be viewed as a means to reduce steam cost.

All EOIs should identify a contract structure(s) such as - 1) Supplier constructs and operates facility and sells steam to DOE through WSRC or 2) Supplier constructs facility and leases it to WSRC for operation.  Suppliers are encouraged to identify other contract structures that may provide better value.   Contract structures should include an explanation of the potential benefits to the DOE.

WSRC will use the following criteria to assess the viability of each expression of interest for the purpose of developing a Suppliers List should WSRC decide to proceed with a Request for Proposal.

1.	The depth and relevance of experience and past performance history.
2.	The steam generation method has a proven history of reliability in similar applications.
3.	The steam generation method can be successfully permitted in the state of South Carolina.
4.	The proposed contract structure appears to be viable.
5.	Preference will be given to steam generation methods that provide a cost savings to DOE.
6.	Preference will be given to steam generation methods that provide energy savings to DOE.
7.	Preference will be given to renewable or “green” energy sources where submitted costs and schedules are competitive with nonrenewable energy sources. 

Suppliers will be notified if they were not selected for placement on the Supplier’s List.

<DESC>Description

NIOSH has been conducting research to study and improve the safety of EMS workers in ambulances.  As part of this effort NIOSH is seeking to research head impact protection padding for general flat surfaces in the ambulance patient compartments.  Research will be disseminated to industry through papers, recommendation to the GSA KKK-A-1822 specification and ambulance manufacturers.  Testing and support will be provided by NIOSH, a federal lab, or private contractor.  NIOSH reserves the right to receive free samples for testing or purchase small samples.  This request will not lead to large purchases, but may lead to influence of the market.  NIOSH and any other involved parties do not promise purchase, analysis or testing of any/or all presented materials.  While no party promises purchasing or testing, the right is reserved, to make single or multiple sole source acquisitions or partnerships based on engineering analysis/evaluation of suitable materials found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government.  NIOSH prefers to receive information that is non-proprietary and releasable in order to support publication and subsequent recommendations.  Proprietary information must be indicated as such prior to receipt.  Design information will be used to support other safety related projects also within the occupational safety arena.


NIOSH seeks: 1.) padding materials for head impact protection 2.) data to support the design and specification of  and 3.) pricing information to support cost effectiveness comparisons at testing and industry usage levels, and pricing at sample quantities.  Specifically, the situation to be analyzed is of an occupant seated next to a wall where the occupant’s head hits the side of a flat surface near the shoulder.  Other situations within the compartment may be looked at later.  Materials such as energy absorbent polyurethane but not to exclude other materials which might perform as well or better are of interest.  Materials should have the following qualities and any information, supporting any or all of these qualities, is requested:

1.	Material should be able to be supplied in usable form to ambulance manufacturers in quantities that might range between approximately 300 Sq Ft and 3,000 Sq Ft per year.  The entire industry might require approximately 150,000 sq ft of material at the required thickness per year.  Materials should be cost effective in this range, and it is preferred that respondents be willing to work with vendors ordering in these quantities or have distribution channels capable of handling small businesses.  Also please give pricing at test sample quantity levels, which might be 30 to 60 square feet.  NIOSH is still interested in a response if this is not the case.
2.	Material should have repeatable and specifiable protective properties.  Repeatability is important to ensure a usable solution.
3.	Material should be able to protect an occupant in a head impact with velocities of between 0 and 30 mph impact velocity of the head to a stationary surface or similarly in a dynamic test with a 30 mph change in velocity and up to a 40 g vehicle deceleration.  Protection is defined by biomechanical criteria such as peak head G response, and HIC level, in a 5th, 50th and 95th human or test dummy head.
4.	Material should have a good cost – performance ratio.  
5.	Material must protect in the temperature range 20° C to 26° C (68° F to 78° F) with interest in the performance capability between -34° C to 52° C (- 30° F to 125° F).  
6.	  Storage performance must be capable of being between -34° C to 52° C (- 30° F to 125° F) without degradation.   These temperatures are based on performance characteristics from GSA-KKK-1822E Sections 3.4.2, 3.13.1, 3.13.4, 3.13.5.
7.	Constitutive property data and or force deflection data to support design with MADYMO, LS-DYNA, ATB or other engineering modeling programs is requested if available.
8.	The availability of predetermined thicknesses for the indicated scenario is a plus.
9.	Moldability is of interest for seamless padding systems and for application to other equipment/systems in the compartment.
10.	Thicknesses in the range of 0.125” to 3” are of primary interest.
11.	Materials of constant stiffness are preferred over those with constant force.

NIOSH requests replies in any form, including any or all of documents, electronic and samples.  Materials and initial samples will not be returned.  Return of more substantial samples may be arranged.  Meetings may be entertained after review of literature.  Proprietary information must be indicated as such, upon receipt.  Information may be shared with a contractor on the project and/or another federal research lab.  Any difficulties with sharing the data should be indicated upon receipt.

NIOSH has a need to receive information on this before June 9th, 2006.  Information is welcome after this date but later receipt may affect participation in possible testing.  No formal receipt of information is requested after August 1, 2006.

Project contact should be made with;

<DESC>The US Army ARDEC-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential  sources for supplying the U.S. Army with the establishment of the Center for  Integrated Security Logistics. The requirement for this award is to establish a  Center for Integrated Security Logistics and begin the process of developing  four components that will dramatically improve the Office of Homeland Defense  ability to respond to emergency events via a more secure logistics supply chain  as well as have application to similar problems encountered by the Army's  ammunition distribution mission.  The four systems are: a) HSMS, a low-cost,  high reliability health and status monitoring system (HSMS) as a safeguard  against specific environmental degradations; b) IAS, an Intelligent Asset system  (IAS) for real-time inventory of assets; c) AAC, a real-time AIT concept to  enable total Asset Accountability/Consumption (AAC) down to the emergency  response system.  Enables on location visibility of shipped assets; and d) AAL,  an Anticipatory (Sense and Respond) Asset Logistics Portal (AALP) for responsive  end-to-end supply chain. All of these proposed systems will be demonstrated at  Homeland Defense exercises planned for the next FY. This approach will also be  tailored to support similar visibility and accountability problems with the  Army's ammunition supply chain and demonstrated at various ammunition supply  point nodes.  Delivery is planned for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2007.   The Government intends to award on sole source basis, a contract to University  of Maryland, Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise, School of Public  Affairs. Respondents should have sufficient capability to furnish these  requirements to the U.S. Army.  Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are  invited to indicate their interest by providing to the U.S. Army a brief  summary of their companyâ€™s capabilities including brief description of  facilities, personnel, and past experience. A follow-up detailed questionnaire  may be provided to survey respondents and on-site visits may be performed as a  result of further analysis. Also, interested firms should provide the name,  address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address, size of business (small/large) and where the facility is located. The information must be submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to: U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC/ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Ms. Rachael Houle/Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07850/e-mail: rachael.houle@us.army.mil.  If there are any technical questions, please contact Mr. Robert Rossi @ (973) 724-2168. This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The information you provide will only be used by  the U.S. Army in developing its acquisition approach for future warhead research  and development requirements.

<DESC>***THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE TO CONTRACTOR’S REGARDING A PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERERENCE TO BE HELD AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) IN GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND.  

All Contractor’s who may be interested in providing a quotation regarding a pending procurement for a Custom optical profiler system for the measurement of micro-cantilever beam deflections in a vacuum environment are encouraged to attend.  If interested in providing an offer; however, are unable to attend the conference, the contract specialist should be notified via email at jroderic@nist.gov.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100 percent set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business manufacturer under the NAICS code identified above. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Custom optical profiler system for the measurement of micro-cantilever beam deflections in a vacuum environment to be used in the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background:
The NIST small force metrology laboratory is developing an instrument to measure the displacements of micro-mechanical and micro-electromechanical devices under point loading. For instance, static forces will be applied to the free end of cantilever specimens using the NIST electrostatic force balance while the full deflection curve of the deflected beams is monitored using interferometry.  


It is expected that the minimum required specifications in the pending solicitation will be as follows:

Minimum Requirements
Vendor shall supply an optical profiler system comprised of an interference microscope with computer control and image processing capabilities as follows:

A. 	Long-working distance, incoherent light interference microscope 
1)	Vacuum compatible: 10-6 Torr; necessary vacuum cabling and feedthroughs are to be supplied by vendor. A small number of blank, unused conflat ports are available on the NIST vacuum system that may be modified for electrical feed through.
2)	Microscope volume (LxWxH):  50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm
3)	Magnifications:  5X, 10X, and 20X
4)	Working distance: at least 20 mm at 20X magnification
5)	Field of view (LxW): at least 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm at 20X magnification
6)	Focus resolution:  plus or minus 5 nm or better
7)	Operating modes: phase-shifting interferometry and vertical scanning interferometery
8)	Adjustable optics:  total optical path length, wavefront curvature, and dispersion of the reference arm must be adjustable to match the sample arm of the interferometer with the various objectives, as well as when an intervening window (up to 8 mm optical quality glass) is in the sample arm path
9)	Camera: black and white CCD with remote video monitor
10)	Light source: software controlled/autosetting, white light or quasi-monochromatic
B.	Microscope control hardware and  image processing software 
1)	Control system compatible with NIST’s existing National Instruments based data acquisition and control system. This system includes a Dell Computer running Windows XP and NI LabView version 7.1. The system has two PCI slots and one PCI express slot available.
2)	I/O and video boards to operate the microscope in the specified modes.
3)	PC Windows XP  based image pattern matching software using subpixel interpolation
4)	PC Windows XP based image analysis software 
C.	Functional Requirements 
1)	Capture surface profile of a cantilever beam 300 um long, 50 um wide and 2 um thick that is deflected by 2 um at its free end. Must be able to output surface contour maps at 10 Hz update rate.
2)	Output average deflection of a user specified sub-area at 100 Hz.

Government Furnished Property

1)	Vacuum compatible mounting fixture for microscope, hereafter referred to as the microscope mount. The microscope mount will be fabricated by the NIST shops after the Critical Design Review meeting. A drawing of the microscope mount will be released to the vendor within 10 days following the CDR.

Optional Performance
Vendor proposals may provide a price option for hardware and software to enable stroboscopic imaging capabilities for measurement of dynamic deflection shapes through a frequency range 100 Hz to 2 MHz.

Special Provisions:
Based on market research, NIST has determined that the required optical profiler system is not available as an off-the-shelf item.  However, NIST has established that commercial non-contact optical profiler systems could meet the minimum technical requirements, provided hardware and electrical cables are modified as follows:

1)	profiler components, electrical cables, and interconnects must be vacuum compatible to 10-6 Torr 
2)	profiler must fit in our vacuum chamber


Pre-bid 
1)	There will be a one day, pre-solicitation conference at NIST’s facility in Gaithersburg, MD to discuss specific design requirements and interfaces including a detailed examination of the vacuum chamber in which the profiler will be installed. This conference will occur before the submission of bids and will allow all potential vendors the opportunity to ask questions and resolve technical details necessary for the generation of a proposal.

The SOW is posted under a separate announcement notice to this notice. The purpose of this Streamlined Non-MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is cheaper for industry or the Government to continue to perform the operation as-is, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for Administrative Support is a Streamlined Non-MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76. This synopsis serves to publish not only the official start date in FEDBIZOPPS at www.eps.gov., but to provide essential information about the study and to seek industry quotes on this current AS-IS effort.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Dennis Sprouse, the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham, the PWS Team Leader is Ms. Sareen Gerson, and the HRA is Mr. Douglas Goodell. Note for industry: this will be the only announcement.  There will be NO Formal RFQ issued under the non-MEO streamlined process.  You are requested to provide best supportable market cost or market pricing on the exact positions geographically disbursed throughout the United States, ensuring you meet all statutory and other Service Contract Act requirements.  Industry quotes must be delivered and received by mail No Later Than May 2, 2005, in the hands of the Contracting Officer for the Office of Competitive Sourcing at the location described herein.  Your market quotes must be fully documented and supported in the following manner:  Provide a hard copy cover letter, and include a CD ROM that contains your pricing quote listing each position FTE Position (by equivalent industry category) by geographical location, priced out at 2080 paid hours, including all required fringe and legal benefits as FT on an Excel Spreadsheet.  Certify and support your claim that in 30 days your firm would be able to have all required personnel in place and fully trained and ready to take over the Administrative Support functions at these locations using all Government provided software, equipment and facilities, and indicate that you would be able to obtain bonding, if required. The cost comparison process as follows:  In accordance with the A76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market  pricing or quote received against the Government’s As-Is estimate to perform the function at the As-Is staffing level and make a final decision.  If it appears that market pricing or quotes are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the quoted pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract, as a formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If the government as-is organization estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

<SUBJECT>--PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF FOUR (4) FISH BIOMONITORING SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the purchase and installation of four systems capable of (a) detecting in real-time on-line sudden changes of water quality caused by intentional or accidental contamination of the water supply, (b) t riggering an auto sampler when certain thresholds values are reached, and (c) sending e-mail/voice messages to water quality managers.  The system selected must have demonstrated its capability to detect contaminants of concern and will enhance the physica l security of New York City Water Supply.  The USACE intends to award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Intelligent Automation Corporation (IAC), 13029 Danielson Street, Suite 200, Poway, CA 92064.  This requisition is for the purchase and installation of four (4) systems cap able of detecting in real-time intentional and accidental contamination of the water supply.  The systems are needed for real-time on-line water quality surveillance deployment at each of New York City three (3) Source Water and one system in the distribut ion system.  Parts of the system are technology specific as no other commercially available systems have demonstrated their ability to detect intentional contamination integrating physiological parameters of living organisms and water quality parameters. The fish biomonitoring system was developed by the US Army Center for Environmental Health Research at Fort Detrick, Maryland and is commercially available from Intelligent Automation Corporation (IAC).  Additional components are required to make the syste m operational.  The fish biomonitoring system has been extensively tested at Fort Detrick with contaminants of concern identified by the US Army, and has shown that it could detect accidental contamination of the water supply (New York and Fort Detrick). The fish biomonitoring is also used by US EPA in an array of sensors on a pipe loop in Cincinnati.  Four (4) complete systems are required including installation (three systems deployed in Westchester County, New York and one in Queens, New York).  Install ation requirements will vary for each location but should include to the minimum water intake, waste water line with connection to sanitary waste line, electrical power, phone line, secure connection to DEP wide area network (wired or wireless), and possib le redundant communication to DEP's wide area network.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation package is available.  Interested organizations who believe they have this capability may submit their capabil ities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Adriana Dunaway at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New York, NY 10278 no later than 2:00 p.m. local time on 16 June 2006.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpo se of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the disc retion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in responses to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit data, which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>--PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF FOUR (4) HACH WATER SECURITY PANELS
<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the purchase and installation of a system capable of (a) detecting in real-time on-line  sudden changes of water quality caused by intentional or accidental  contamination of the water supply, (b) identifying groups of contaminants  based on fingerprints made on real-time on-line sensors and (c)  notifying water quality managers of sudden water quality changes.  The  system selected will enhance the physical security of New York City Water  Supply.  This Brand/Technology Specific Requisition is for the purchase of  four (4) systems capable of detecting intentional and accidental  contamination of the water supply in the distribution system.  The USACE  intends to award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to  Hach Company, PO Box 389, Loveland, CO 80539-0389 under GSA schedule No.  GS-07F-9314S.  The brand specific request is actually technology  specific as no other commercially available systems have demonstrated  their ability to detect intentional contamination and identify the  contaminant group.  The Hach Company developed such a system.  Laboratory  and pipe loop tests have shown that the Hach Water Security Panel coupled  with the Hach Event Monitor can recognize specific fingerprints of groups  of chemical and biological agents.  A refrigerated auto sampler is also  required for each unit in order to capture a water sample when the trigger  threshold is reached.  An uninterrupted power supply (UPS) and complete  installation of the water security panel/event monitor, including water  intake, waste water line, power and communication, two-year service  contract with maintenance and consumable will be provided for each of the  four systems.  The Hach Water Security Panel is composed of seven sensors  and a data logger.  The data logger communicates with the Event Monitor.   The Event Monitor is a wall-mounted touch screen Windows XP Pro computer  with proprietary software to integrate water quality parameters from six  of the seven sensors.  Once purchased, the system will be loaded with the  contaminant library.  The software algorithm is the object of a US Patent.   The technology was successfully tested by US EPA Environmental Technology  Verification (ETV) Program.  Installation of the four (4) Hach Water  Security Panels, Event Monitors and auto samplers as well as a two-year  service maintenance contract (including Field Service Partnership Package,  supply of reagents a and calibration solutions) are to be provided.   Installation will include mounting of the Event Monitor and Water Security  Panel to the wall, connections to water and waste line (includes slop  sink), and connections to electrical power, phone and DEP wide area  network.  A redundant communication system may be added.  This notice of  intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation  package is available.  Interested organizations who believe they have this  capability may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the  effort in writing to Adriana Dunaway at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New  York, NY 10278 no later than 2:00 p.m. local time on 16 June 2006.  Such  capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose  of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive  basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed  effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this  notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral  communications are not acceptable in responses to this notice.  All  responsible sources may submit data, which shall be considered by the  agency.

The VA believes that Medtronic Navigation is the only company that can provide the updates, both hardware and software, required for their system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements to upgrade the existing system. Information may be sent to the Contracting Office, VA Medical Center, Hampton, Va. 23667. Responses received will be evaluated however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Medtronic Navigation.

<RESPDATE>062206
<ARCHDATE>06012007
<CONTACT>Dale Aubin Contracting Officer 4132538230 Dale_Aubin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Region 5, is planning a combined synopsis/solicitation to Furnish and Install an enclosure(s) over the Fish Production Raceways located at the Allegheny National Fish Hatchery, Warren County, Warren Pennsylvania. This solicitation will use evaluation and negotiated procedures as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12, Commercial Items Acquistion .  ALL SPECIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS SYNOPSIS, THEREFORE, NO FURTHER SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL BE ISSUED; OTHER THAN DRAWINGS.  The ultimate contract award will be based on a "Best Value Continuum".  Interested, responsible firms, with an excellent track record of past performance, are invited to submit a proposal to enclose the fish production raceways at the Allegheny National Fish Hatchery, Warren, Pennsylvania.   Enclosing the raceways is necessary to reduce the risk of future fish disease outbreaks at the hatchery.  Enclosed raceways will reduce pathogen transmission risks associated with bird and mammal predation. Bird predators such as ducks, geese, gulls, heron, and songbirds are seen to pose the greatest risk of transmitting disease.  Mammal predators, such as mink, otter, raccoons, groundhogs, opossum, and deer also pose a risk of transmitting disease.  Water overspray mist which is released by an adjacent dam is also a potential source of disease transmission. The raceways may be enclosed within either one or two large building structures.  Drawings (3 sheets) showing a "two building option" and a "single building option" will be made available to interested, qualified firms.   Proposals may be submitted to implement one or both of these options.  The overall dimensions of each enclosure under the two building option will be approximately 440 feet by 61 feet +/-.  The overall dimensions of the enclosure under the single building option will be approximately 440 feet by 142 feet +/-.    The minimum clear height within each enclosure shall be no less than 14 feet.  The single building option shall include a total of six (6) 10' x 14' overhead doors, and six personnel doors located as shown on the attached drawing on each end of the building. The two building option shall include a total of four (4) 10' x 14' overhead doors, and four personnel doors located as shown on the attached drawing on each end of the building.  Two (2) additional personnel doors shall be provided along the north sidewall of each building structure to split the access distance into the raceway enclosure into thirds.   No electrical or lighting work is required.   There will be no water delivered through the raceways when the work is scheduled to be performed. To safeguard the structure(s) against potential disease outbreaks, the interior sidewalls of each structure will be disinfected every 6 months by hatchery personnel with a 250-300 ppm chlorine solution.  Each enclosure shall be constructed with a corrosion resistant steel or aluminum frame and vinyl fabric covering, or as a pre-engineered metal building. (Note: Available drawing will show cross sections which depict a typical fabric cover enclosure - proposals will also be considered for other types of pre-engineered enclosures.)  The enclosure shall be warranted by the manufacturer for a minimum of 12 years, available in a choice of colors, and shall be capable of transmitting some natural light into the enclosed space. Enclosure fabric/skin cannot be translucent/clear, but must be capable of transmitting sufficient subdued light into the enclosed space to allow the hatchery staff to operate the fish production raceways during day time hours. The structure(s) should be suitable for use in protecting water and waste water facilities and should be provided with a means of natural ventilation to eliminate condensation issues. It would be desirable if the natural ventilation system could be designed to minimize the amount of outside mist entering into the enclosed space. The structure(s) must be rated for the snow and wind loading conditions in the Warren, Pennsylvania area. If the two building option is provided, snow will accumulate within the corridor between the two buildings, so the enclosure sidewalls must also be capable of withstanding the horizontal snow load.  If your proposal is selected by the Government, stamped drawings by a Registered Professional Engineer shall be provided ensuring building integrity is certified and satisfying local code and permit requirements. You will be required to provide manufacturers information which thoroughly describes the items and features to be included with the proposed enclosure(s). Also identify any items or features that would need to be accomplished by others to provide a complete project.  Prospective contractors are encouraged to inspect the hatchery site prior to submitting a proposal. The site can be inspected by contacting Hatchery Manager Tracy Copeland at (814) 726-0890.   The NAICS is 423390.  This procurement is unrestricted.  Interested firms shall submit two (2) copies of all appropriate information as described above (including proposed costs, terms, and conditions) to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035-9589, Attn:  Dale E. Aubin, Contracting Officer, not later than close of business June 22, 2006.

						8 May 2006
							
MEMORANDUM FOR 10 MSG/LGCB (Attn:  Will Schlegel)

FROM:  HQ USAFA/PLA

SUBJECT:  Justification for Brand Name Only

1.  The athletic department is preparing to replace the annual bench stock of durable athletic goods (coaching gear, uniforms and athletic shoes) used throughout last year’s various athletic programs for the Prep School.  The United States Air Force Academy has a contract with NIKE for these good for the athletic programs for the Academy athletic program that does not include the Prep School because of NCAA recruiting regulations. Purchasing the NIKE brand is required to match the existing clothing styles, athletic shoes and team uniforms and avoids the need to dispose of NIKE equipment that remains suitable for use by the Prep School.  The estimated cost of this requirement is approximately $40,000.00.  
2.  The Nike brand of durable goods is currently in use for intercollegiate athletic competition at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  The USAFA Prep School athletes will continue to benefit from the wear and use of the same equipment, apparel and footwear supplied at USAFA as well as continues to enhance their specific athletic preparation. 
3.  PLA performed market research and concluded that other companies do provide similar products of this nature.  What was found was if the current bench stock was to be replaced by another athletic brand, significant cost would be incurred due to several factors:  rework of current logo’s, screening, matching uniformity of sport specific athletic uniforms and coaching apparel could lead to having to purchase entire new sets of clothing and uniforms.  Another factor taken into account was the requirements of spares on hand.  After review the current brand of durable athletic goods is the most cost effective and most efficient method for a viable replacement program for of our athletic department.  
4.  Based on the above information, we recommend the Nike brand as the only product capable of meeting the current government requirements.  The requiring activity certifies that the information provided to support this recommendation is complete and accurate to the best of our knowledge.

Tobyhanna Army Depot regulations regarding access, safety, and security, are as follows: SAFETY 1 .  Tobyhanna Army Depot is an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) site.  Tobyhanna Army Depot requires full contractor compliance with all applicable safety regulations and standards. The Contractor is re sponsible for maintaining, monitoring and enforcing full compliance. 2.  Contractors must comply with all Department of Labor and OSHA Rules and Regulations, 29 CFR 1910 (General Industries) and/or 1926 (Construction), and all applicable sections of the Na tional Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes. 3.  STANDARDS FOR ELECTRICAL SAFETY - Particular attention is directed to NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces.  Contractor shall fully comply with all sections of th is standard, including but not limited to;  PART I, Chapter 2. SECURITY: NON-RESIDENT/NON-IMMIGRANT ALIENS a. All non-resident/non-immigrant aliens must have approval prior to being permitted access to Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD).  Such approval must be ob tained by requesting access through the following: apply at the alien-residents embassy; proceed to the U.S. Embassy; proceed to the Department of the Army; proceed to Army Materiel Command; proceed to U.S. Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management  Command; proceed to TYAD.  b.  All non-resident/non-immigrant aliens granted access to TYAD are required to be escorted by Government personnel.  One Government escort can accommodate a maximum of two non-resident/non-immigrant aliens. c.  Due to limited availability of Government personnel, contractors shall not be permitted to employ non-resident/non-immigrant aliens as part of the contractors on-site workforce.  Limited exceptions to this restriction may be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Such exc eptions shall only be considered where a specialized skill or trade is not otherwise available, and even under such circumstances would only be considered for v ery limited duration, e.g., a few hours/days.  However, even if limited exception is considered, access may still be denied.  Contractors whose personnel are either denied entry to TYAD or permitted limited entry to TYAD due to the security requirements pe rtaining to non-resident aliens/non-immigrants are not relieved of their obligation to provide the required contract performance and must do so at no additional cost to the Government.  Any contractor failing to perform or that fails to perform in a timely  manner under such circumstances may be terminated for default or other contractual remedies as appropriate.  d.  Due to limited availability of Government personnel, visitors requiring escort may not be permitted access, or access may be limited to a cert ain time and duration. SECURITY SEARCHES AND IN-PROCESSING All persons seeking entrance to TYAD must submit to and comply with all security standards and requirements in force at the time such persons are seeking entry.   All visitors and contractors, rega rdless of resident status or citizenship, will be subject to vehicle search and intense in-processing by TYAD Security personnel prior to being granted access to TYAD.  This security screening process may be time consuming and access may be delayed or deni ed. CONTRACTOR ON-SITE WORKFORCE  A.  If a contractor intends to use resident aliens (immigrants) for on-site performance, then prior to the commencement of performance under the contract and within seven (7) workdays of contract award, the Contractor shal l submit to the Chief, Security Division, Tobyhanna Army Depot, a roster of all contractor personnel, inclusive of on-site supervisory or managerial personnel and sub-contractor personnel, that the Contractor anticipates will be performing work on-site.  T he roster shall indicate which individuals are U.S. citizens and which are resident aliens (immigrants).  The following documentation shall accompany the roster for each individual named on the roster as a resident alien (immigrant): a)   a copy of a verif iable form of identification, such as a drivers license or a passport; and b)   a copy of a valid Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card (Green Card).  B. Within six (6) workdays of the s ubmission of the roster and documentation, the Government will have completed the security check and the Contractor shall be notified whether all listed personnel will be permitted to work on-site.  However, actual access to Tobyhanna Army Depot by the ros ter personnel will remain contingent upon such resident alien (immigrant) individuals presenting two (2) forms of identification as they process into the Depot through the Security building: a valid Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card (Green Card ) in addition to at least one other verifiable form of identification.  C.   The roster which the Contractor submits is amendable.  However, up to five (5) workdays will be required to perform a security check on any resident alien (immigrant) personnel ad ded to the roster. The Contractor is urged to include contingency or back-up personnel in the original Roster in order to avoid delays due to Roster amendment.  D. Contractors whose personnel are denied entry to TYAD due to the security requirements are not relieved of their obligation to provide the required contract performance and must do so at no additional cost to the Government.  Any contractor failing to perform or that fails to perform in a timely manner under such circumstances may be terminated for default or be subject to other contractual remedies as appropriate. E. Contractors who fail to identify any and all resident aliens (immigrants) who will be used for on-site performance and who will seek access to Tobyhanna Army Depot as a worker for o r through the contractor, inclusive of managerial and subcontractor personnel, may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and sanctions as well as contract remedies. F.  Notwithstanding the above requirements, Tobyhanna Army Depot reserves the right to require any contractor to submit an employee roster and to institute security screening of any contractor employees, inclusive of on-site supervisory or manage rial personnel and sub-contractor personnel that the Contractor anticipates will be performing work on-site, as  determined necessary by the Depot Chief of Security.  G.  While within the confines of Tobyhanna Army Depot, Contractor employees will adhere t o and be governed by all rules, regulations, policies, procedures and directives issued by the Commanding Officer, Tobyhanna Army Depot, and said employees will be required to conduct themselves in the same manner required of Government employees.
