<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Russell Sage Foundation, New York, NY to perform a professional service contract for Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) Coupon Manager Software.  The purpose of this contract is to create a new version of the RDS Coupon Manager (RDSCM) Version 1.0 program to meet the needs and specifications of NHBS-IDU.  The resulting Coupon Manager program will be referenced to herein as "RDSCM version 2.0".  The purpose of this contract is also to provide training and technical assistance for the RDSCM and RDSAT software programs.  There are 3 commercially available coupon manager programs that have been developed to date:  1) IRIS which is a DOS-based program and was last used in 1999.  This software is limited in that it can not be operated in a MS Window environment and will support only a limited sample size.  2) IRIS+ program translated the original IRIS software into MS Access.  This software is limited in that it can only be operated using MS Access, which is prohibited by CDC, and contains extraneous features not needed for NHBS-IDU.  3) RDSCM program version 1.0 was developed in 2004 by Douglas Hechathorn of Russell Sage Foundation.  RDSCM is a Java based program and uses the HSGL database engine.  Therefore, RDSCM is the most suitable software program for NHBS-IDU, as it does not require MS Access, it can operate in a MS Windows environment, and it can be tailored to the specific needs of NHBS-IDU.  The tasks specified will require expertise, knowledge and experience in the RDS methodology and in developing and using software that tracks disbribution and redemption of referral coupons and incentives used for data collection.  Programmers shall have a level of expertise in working with database software and systems; experience in providing training in the use of the database and software and knowledge and experience in conducting analysis of data collected using developed software and database.  The tasks will also require expertise, knowledge and experience in using an RDS analysis tool, including exporting data collected via the RDS database (described in the above paragraph), formatting and importing the data into the analysis tool, and conducting RDS-specific data analysis.  RDS-specific analysis for measuring sample equilibrium; and creating spatial maps to determine geographic disbribution of the sample.  This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; requests for quotations are not available.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.  If any responses are submitted in response to this presolicitation notice and the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice.  A subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  Cababilities shall be submitted to:  Kimberly P. Groves (MS-1019), Reference:  00HCK51A-2005-19108, DHHS, PHS, CDC, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV  26505.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>(1) General:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, is seeking contractor(s) to provide services for the collection of rangeland data on selected sample sites (points) for the 2005 National Resources Inventory (NRI), Rangeland Field Study in Montana.  The intent of the Agency is to solicit the most efficient and effective manner to complete the requirements of this inventory.   The performance period for the base year begins June 1, 2005 and ends November 15, 2005.   Options will also be included for the 2006 – 2008 inventories.

(2) Background:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is mandated (through the Rural Development Act of 1972, the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and other supporting legislation) to assess the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources on the Nation’s non-Federal lands.  Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.

<SUBJECT>A -- Linear Photonic RF Front-End Technology (PHOR-FRONT)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-20
<RESPDATE>042905
<CONTACT>Steve Pappert, DARPA Program Manager, MTO, Phone (571) 218-4679, Fax (703) 696-2206, Email spappert@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of linear photonic radio frequency (RF) front-ends supporting the need for extremely high dynamic range microwave receivers.  Proposed research should investigate innovative microwave photonic transmission approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The objective of PHOR-FRONT is to develop and demonstrate intrinsically linear, high sensitivity optical transmission techniques which can serve as the analog front-end of a digital microwave receiver.  A key objective is to replace conventional electronic low-noise amplifiers, mixers and copper cables with highly linear microwave photonic links providing RF gain, low Noise Figure (NF), frequency down-conversion to Intermediate Frequency (IF) or baseband, and most importantly, extremely high two-tone Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR).  With the understanding that processing wideband RF antenna signals into High Dynamic Range (HDR) digital bit streams is an important military thrust, this development serves to provide the critical optoelectronic (OE) infrastructure allowing a universal RF front-end that enables remote HDR digital processing.  This solicitation specifically addresses the development of the OE modules deemed most critical to achieving the targeted bandwidth, SFDR and NF requirements for transmission and down-conversion of microwave antenna signals.  The use of 1550 nm wavelength coherent optical transmission techniques incorporating LINEAR Phase Modulation (PM) and LINEAR phase demodulation is highly desirable and considered an attractive approach in achieving the required NF and SFDR.  As such, the 1550 nm coherent optical oscillator and the linear phase demodulator, e.g. a balanced optical mixer phase-locked-loop discriminator, are considered the most critical modules necessary to achieve this goal.  Optical phase modulation at the transmitter side, although necessary, is considered a lower risk element of the photonic front-end and not considered part of this solicitation.  The back-end analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is also not addressed in this solicitation; however, the proposed photonic RF front-end approaches should be fully compatible with HDR ADC back-end implementations.  In fact, the OE module flow-down requirements have been aligned with projected (less than 10 year) ADC performance levels for bandwidth and resolution. 

The targeted end-of-program performance goal is to provide at least 90 dB of 2-tone SFDR in a 500 MHz Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW), at any center frequency within the desired operating frequency range of 0.5-18 GHz.  This multi-octave range of RF signals will result from multiple antenna outputs, and it can be assumed that the frequency band of each antenna covers less than an octave.  A photonic RF front-end NF of 3 dB is targeted in association with the SFDR goal.   It is envisioned that PHOR-FRONT will enable a dramatic leap in performance for applications such as channelized Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  In this example application, each antenna feed would be applied to individual PHOR-FRONT links, which in turn provide input signals for individual receiver systems.

For the development of the PHOR-FRONT modules, DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following device areas:

I.	1550 nm Coherent Optical Oscillator
The first major interest of the PHOR-FRONT program is the development and demonstration of a narrow-linewidth, low-noise, high power, frequency-stabilized coherent optical oscillator.  The spectral region of interest for this single frequency laser is the 1550 nm communications band, where a wealth of supporting optoelectronic component infrastructure exists.  In addition to supporting highly linear analog photonic links, the challenging performance specification goals targeted for the laser have been chosen to meet other coherent oscillator application needs.  Innovative semiconductor, solid-state and fiber laser approaches to producing compact laser modules that can meet these challenging performance specifications are solicited.  This area of interest has four sub-tasks:

A.	Develop and demonstrate a narrow-linewidth (less than 10 Hz) single-mode laser design at 1550 nm wavelength that can readily scale in output power (greater than 1 W) and show a path to high wall plug efficiency (greater than 20 percent);  

B.	Incorporate Amplitude Modulation (AM) & Frequency Modulation (FM) laser noise reduction techniques into the laser design enabling shot-noise-limited performance to be obtained at small frequency offsets from the optical carrier (less than 1 MHz);

C.	Develop and demonstrate a precise high-resolution frequency stabilization method for realizing long-term absolute wavelength stability (less than 100 kHz total excursion); and  

D.	Demonstrate and deliver the laser performance required to realize the photonic RF front-end receiver NF and SFDR to be demonstrated in conjunction with the second area of interest below.  

The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate a functional coherent optical oscillator, and to demonstrate a design path to increased performance levels.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the optical oscillator with full performance specifications enabling the targeted photonic link SNR, NF and SFDR goals to be achieved in conjunction with the second area of interest below.

II.	Linear Optical Phase Demodulator
The second major area of interest is the design, fabrication and demonstration of a strictly linear optical phase demodulator to be used in conjunction with a linear optical PM transmitter.  Phase demodulation techniques that produce intrinsically linear receiver transfer characteristics, as opposed to relying principally on intermodulation distortion (IMD) cancellation methods, are central to this task.  One possible example of a coherent receiver that falls within the scope of this task area is a balanced mixer optical phase-locked-loop (OPLL) discriminator.  In this case, the OPLL output error signal can be configured to instantaneously track the phase of the input signal, i.e. a linear PM demodulator.  Coherent receivers for 0.5-18 GHz phase modulated optical signals with 500 MHz IBW providing greater than90 dB SFDR are of interest.  Coherent phase-tracking/phase-nulling approaches as well as other novel approaches for achieving strictly linear coherent phase demodulation and downconversion will be considered, provided that detailed analyses and simulations support the RF link performance claims.

It is important to note a few considerations pertaining to the envisioned military applications.  The targeted RF antenna applications for space-based, air-borne, maritime or ground-based military platforms dictate that the signal laser (1550 nm coherent optical oscillator) can be remotely co-located with the receiver optoelectronics, providing several local oscillator and feedback implementation options that can be explored.  In addition, the use of polarization-maintaining fiber can be assumed for the short antenna/processor fiber runs, eliminating the need for polarization diversity receiver techniques to be considered.  These considerations should simplify the coherent receiver implementation required for this task area.

This area of interest has four general sub-tasks:

A.	Develop and demonstrate a phase demodulator design at a wavelength of 1550 nm that provides highly linear (OIP3 greater than +75 dBm) performance in conjunction with a large 1 dB compression-point dynamic range (greater than 175 dB);  

B.	Develop receiver and link models to simulate and predict both receiver and link performance levels for given laser and modulator parameters; 

C.  	Identify/analyze major sources of noise and nonlinearities in the coherent link that are related to the receiver and incorporate mitigation techniques; and  

D.	Demonstrate and deliver the coherent optical receiver performance required to realize the photonic RF front-end receiver NF and SFDR to be demonstrated in conjunction with the first area of interest above.  

For all proposed approaches and implementations, fully functional linear phase demodulation chips/modules are to be developed and demonstrated.  The proposal should provide simulation and analysis depicting the expected link linearity of the proposed approach using 1550 nm laser specifications similar to that being developed in Area I of this solicitation.  Proposals should clearly describe all major parametric dependencies of the link linearity in the system, including system components not addressed in this solicitation (e.g. front-end optical modulator).  The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate a functional linear optical phase discriminator, and to demonstrate a design and integration path to increased performance levels.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the optical phase discriminator with full performance specifications enabling the targeted photonic link bandwidth, NF and SFDR goals to be achieved.

PHOR-FRONT offerors are encouraged to submit innovative proposals that address either or both of the areas of interest, as proposers are not required to address both topics.  Although not a requirement, teaming is encouraged where warranted, especially under Area II which would necessitate integration of various photonic and electronic technologies.

The selected performers will be required to deliver individual devices and groups of devices (subsystems) that form analog photonic RF front-end building blocks at appropriate intervals within the program to a DARPA-designated facility.  Offerors are also asked to submit a list and timetable of deliverables. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 05-20 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below. 

PROGRAM SCOPE

The PHOR-FRONT program will consist of a 15 month Phase I effort with contractor defined Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of 12 months.  This will be followed by a 15-month Phase II option to achieve the full performance targets if not achievable in Phase I.  Clearly stated, quantitative milestones at 12, 21 and 30 months into the program are required.  Offerors are strongly encouraged (Evaluation Criteria (3)) to pursue aggressive development schedules towards meeting the program goals in a most timely manner.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to, design, fabrication, integration and packaging are encouraged, but not required.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.

<DESC>Revolutionizing Prosthetics, BAA05-26, Proposals Due Noon ET, April 29, 2005, POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO; Phone: (571) 218-4674; Fax: (703) 807-4956.

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking proposals to develop an advanced upper-extremity prosthesis.  The vision of this program is to create a neurally controlled artificial limb that will restore full motor and sensory capability to upper extremity amputee patients.  This revolutionary prosthesis will be controlled, feel, look and perform like the native limb.  Submissions must provide evidence of a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary team capable of fulfilling the vision, objectives and milestones of the program.  The final product will be an advanced prosthesis ready for human clinical trials including completed submission of an Investigational New Device (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  An accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) must also be referenced to aid in production of proposals (www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/prosthesisPIP.htm).  Successful proposals will address the program goals and specifications detailed in this BAA and in the associated PIP.

A complete prosthetic upper extremity with full motor and sensory function will be delivered and function as well as a normal human arm.  This prosthesis will be perceived by the patient as natural with respect to function, weight, durability and comfort.  To accomplish this will necessitate novel technology in research areas such as neural control, sensory input, advanced mechanics and actuators, and prosthesis design and integration.  Components should provide strength, environmental tolerance (heat, cold, water, humidity, dust, etc) and durability such that the device will last at least 10 years with normal use.  While this BAA focuses on prosthetics for upper extremities, it is expected that the technologies will allow future improvements on lower extremity prosthetics as well.

Specific metrics are listed in the PIP and include, in part, (1) complete transmission and accurate interpretation of afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor control) signals between the nervous system (central and/or peripheral) and the prosthesis; (2) temperature, touch (two-mm discrimination) and force (0.1 N) sensation; (3) simultaneous control of joints, (4) human-like range of motion for the elbow (one degree of freedom [DOF]), wrist (two DOF) and fingers (four DOFs each); (5) elbow flex-extend strength of up to 60 ft-lbs.; (6) pinch strength of up to 20lbs and grip strength to 70 lbs; (7) wrist flexion strength of up to 60 ft-lbs; (8) 24 hour endurance between refuel or recharge while conducting activities for daily living; and (9) operational speed up to 120 degrees/sec with a 10 msec response time.  While some degree of shared local control is expected, DARPA considers the ability to provide neural control to the prosthesis to be essential to achieving the desired outcome of restoring full motor and sensory capabilities. Proposals that do not utilize neural control as a significant mechanism for controlling the prosthetic are not of interest.

Achievement of program milestones/metrics will demand prompt identification of areas requiring further research and rapid incorporation of advancements made in these areas into the prosthetic device.   Because of the need to quickly and safely incorporate new technologies into the final product for IND submission, successful proposals will contain an assessment/analysis of the current "state of the art" in the field of upper extremity prosthetics along with a clear statement of the integrated vision for this effort.

TEAMING
The goals of the prosthetic device program demand that a central element of the successful proposal will be a multi-disciplinary team of demonstrated (or established) capability.  Involved fields of expertise should include, at a minimum, expertise in the clinical sciences, neurosciences, engineering, materials/biomaterials sciences, control engineering, training, medical device manufacture & pre-commercial marketing, and experience with the FDA approval process.  Proposals that center solely on one research area, while neglecting the overall vision, will not be considered for funding.

It is critical that the research team be built from its inception around a Systems Integrator (SI).  The SI will be responsible for the overall team direction, organization, and accomplishment of all milestones and the delivery of the final product including the IND.  Consequently, the SI must have a proven record of success in integration efforts of similar complexity as well as a commitment to shepherd the prosthetic development through transition.  SI must demonstrate complete understanding and sharing of the DARPA vision of a fully functional upper-extremity prosthesis; SI that is strictly in the effort for project management will not be successful.  As the team leader held accountable for timely delivery of the proposed work, the SI must have the authority to develop and maintain the proper team membership to ensure accomplishment of the task.

DARPA will evaluate teams on their understanding of the challenges, as well as capabilities, prior experience, current data, and available facilities to conduct the proposed work.  It is left to the discretion of the proposer to construct their team from the fields and researchers/companies that are necessary to carry out the effort.  However, because of the importance of the neural control aspect of this effort, proposals are strongly encouraged to include more than one research component in this area.  Since team composition will ultimately determine the success of this program, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at www.sainc.com/ProsthesisTeaming. 

PROGRAM PHASES
This effort will be conducted in two 24-month phases.  Proposers are requested to submit a proposal that addresses the technical effort in both phases.  The goal of this program, a neurally controlled artificial limb that provides full functionality as determined by the Jebson-Taylor Hand Function Test, is extremely aggressive.  Consequently, it is necessary that progress will be assessed regularly throughout the program via scheduled milestones and metrics associated with the performance of critical components.  At the end of the Phase 1 period, the team's performance will be evaluated in two areas: 1) progress on each of the critical research areas as determined by appropriate metrics detailed here and in the associated PIP, and 2) a detailed systems engineering plan for the integration of the critical components into the prosthetic device.

Successful Phase I teams will demonstrate significant progress towards—or enabling technologies for—the realization of the prosthetic metrics detailed here and in the associated PIP.  Critical areas include demonstration of the extent to which sensory (afferent) feedback can be provided to the nervous system and approaches to overcome any sensory limitations, plus interrogation methods that can quantitatively differentiate afferent and efferent signals from prosthesis sensors and peripheral nerves.  It is imperative that performers show that afferent signals can be cognitively perceived appropriately by the subject, suitability of the prosthesis design for use in transhumeral or shoulder disarticulation amputations, with a level of modularity that will enable adaptation to varying degrees of stump length.  Also important is the demonstration of progress/achievement in the mechanical, environmental, interface capabilities required by the program especially: (1) chronically implantable neural interfaces, (2) full biomimetic kinematics capable of a complete grasp set and free swing kinematics exhibited by the native limb during walking locomotion, (3) inertial properties that match the lost limb, (4) effective cosmetic matching to the amputee, (5) robustness in typical indoor and outdoor environments, (6) a design amenable to direct skeletal attachment and (7) technical approaches designed to be viable in vivo for greater than 1 year.

A successful integration plan will demonstrate that there is a defined application of efferent motor and afferent sensory capabilities for control of robotic arm and hand, demonstration that the strategy used to actuate the prosthesis includes proprioception and sensory feedback (i.e., the patient will be able to accomplish activity of daily living tasks in the dark), a clear strategy to integrate the prosthesis with patients. The patient must be able to wear the prosthesis for 18 hours/day without discomfort, or pathologies such as skin dehiscence, callous formation, etc after 3 months of daily use.  Finally, a detailed approach should be included for incorporating the functional parameters in the prosthesis within the program goals of weight, shape, and appearance.  Proposals that do not address the full integration of component technologies into an upper limb prosthesis or do not plan for the appropriate approval process and product commercialization are generally not of interest.  

Based on the results of Phase I, there may be a downselect.  Phase II, for those selected to continue, will culminate in delivery of the final product, an advanced prosthesis ready for human clinical trials including completed submission of an Investigational New Device (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN USE
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.  
For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a Federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a Federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

<CONTACT>Patricia A. Fort Contracting Officer 2083733910     Pat_Fort@blm.gov;
<DESC>Introduction The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Fish, Wildlife and Botany Group is seeking contractor(s) to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for a variety of tasks in support of the mission of the Group which provides technical and policy direction for the management of fish, wildlife, threatened and endangered species and botanical resources on public lands.  The number and frequency of these tasks is variable over time and will be dependent upon priorities, other workloads and available funding.   Tasks Editing and abstracting documents.  BLM periodically completes agency documents or reports that require editing to meet size limit requirements or a particular style.  The target for these publications can vary from the scientific community to lay audiences.   Examples include annual Fish, Wildlife and Botany Accomplishment Reports which summarize major accomplishments related to management of fish, wildlife, T&E species and botany programs to completing a technical report such at the current status of prairie dogs on BLM lands.  In most cases the author would be taking unedited summary reports from individuals or offices and preparing a summary document highlighting major accomplishments or information.  Formats will vary depending upon the audience. Technical Report Writing:  Occasionally BLM requires the updating or preparation of a technical report that synthesizes existing scientific literature about a particular subject.  Examples include summarizing existing literature about the management of habitats for a particular species of plant or animal.  In some cases we will request that a new report be prepared on a new subject while at other times, the writer would be expected to update an existing technical report. Fact Sheets:  BLM's national office attends numerous meetings on an annual basis that require preparation of various types of handouts including up to-date fact sheets that summarize such things as budget status, major issues, highlights of recent accomplishments, etc.  BLM will provide raw material and a format for the preparation of these fact sheets.  Generally each Fact Sheet will be 1-2 pages in length with some minimum amount of graphics. Strategic Plans:  The BLM Fish, Wildlife and Botany Program periodically updates or develops strategic plans for various program areas or areas within an existing program area such as Bird Conservation.  These documents are 20-30 pages in length contain multiple graphics and photos and generally use 2-3 column formats. Layout for Desktop Publishing: Includes preparation of documents in "near final form" in MS Word, generally 2-3 column formats with tables, charts and graphics that are suitable for web publication or posting on BLM internet sites.   Photo Scanning:   The BLM's Fish, Wildlife and Botany Program has a need to scan, edit (clean up), and catalog hundreds of existing photographs and copied onto CD's so they can ultimately be archived on BLM's national photographic library data base.  In addition to minor editing, we would expect each photo to be catalogued following the BLM format required in the searchable national data base. Document Scanning:  This task includes scanning a variety of types of documents such as BLM Manuals and Handbooks, older out of print BLM Technical Notes, Strategy plans, agreements, etc.  Size and number will vary from a few pages to documents approaching 100 pages in length.  BLM will want the flexibility to receive scanned documents in both Adobe PDF and MS Word formats; therefore quoters must have capability to produce editable documents.   Computer Equipment:  Individuals must have a personal computer, printer, and access to scanning equipment and the internet.  A brief description should be included that describes your equipment and skills in using both hardware and software associated with your equipment.  Potential quoters must be familiar with MS Word, MS Excel, MS Photo Editor or equivalent.  BLM requires that all documents provided to them are in Microsoft compatible formats. Travel:  Must be willing to travel to BLM hosted meetings if necessary.  Meetings would occur in the western U.S.  The need for travel would be rare but is still a possibility if we need assistance.  Travel expenses would be covered in the specific task associated with the meeting. References:  Provide at least two separate references that we can contact as part of our follow up to reviewing your response.  Please provide the name and a current phone number for each contact. Samples of Written Work:  Please provide at least two samples of recent written documents that demonstrate your writing abilities.  Samples need not be the entire document.  Please submit no more than 10 pages total.  Samples can include technical reports, grant proposals, briefing papers, or other popular literature, news articles, etc.  Please provide a brief description of how each documents was used. Other:  May also provide additional information or samples of work that illustrate their familiarity with computers, software or hardware.  Examples could include Power Point presentation; graphics generated using Excel, graphic artwork, etc.  A brief description of what the product is and how it was used should be provided. Evaluation Criteria :  The folllowing evaluation criteria will be used in evaluating your response: 1.  Technical writing and editing BLM publications for both technical and lay audiences. 2.  Ability to complete and summarize literature reviews of technical information on natural resource management issues primarily related to fish, wildlife or special status species management. 3.  Preparing draft Strategic Plans. 4.  Facilitating and/or preparing summary of agency meetings. 5.  Evaluating Challenge Grant Project Proposals (e.g. reviewing and ranking them based upon criteria provided by the BLM). 6.  Layout of draft technical publications or other agency produced publications such as strategic plans, technical references, etc. 7.  Familiarity with State and federal natural resource agencies, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies organizations; 8.  Ability to scan both text and graphics for archiving or posting on the internet.  Text documents must be available in either PDF or MS Word formats.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA Region 9, San Francisco) announces an opportunity in Construction Excellence for repair and alteration of the HVAC systems at the PJKK Courthouse and Federal Building in Honolulu, HI. This project proposes repairs and alterations to the mechanical HVAC systems, along with repairs to related finishes, in this Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. The building was built in 1977 and consists of a ten-story Federal office building and a five-story U.S. Courthouse on approximately 8 acres.  The Courthouse is rectangular in shape, while the Federal Building is divided into a ten-story wing and a seven-story wing which intersect in the southwest corner.  This project is intended to help remove moisture from the air entering the building, eliminate leaks in the mechanical system, improve the building’s air flow, and increase control of all mechanical system components. The cost of construction is estimated at between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  This is not a request for proposal.  Firms interested in proposing should submit a one-page letter of intent to propose for this project.    The letter of intent may be faxed to Greg McSweeney at (415) 522-3316, or e-mailed to greg.mcsweeney@gsa.gov.  Firms expressing intent will receive the Request for Proposal, including the technical factors as well as the plans and specifications in  March 2005.  The selection process will be based on the procedures in FAR Part 15.3. The RFP will include a request for both Price and Technical Proposals that include the specialized experience of the Prime Contractor, specialized experience of the Mechanical Subcontractor and the Past Performance of the firms.  The “greatest value” concept will be employed. This is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most value for the price, not necessarily to select the lowest price.
	The offerors will submit both technical and price proposals. The evaluation of the 
price and technical proposals will be distinctly separate to assure the impartiality of the technical review.  Upon completion of the technical review, an analysis combining both price and technical considerations will be made to determine the best value.  The technical factors are significantly more important than the price factors.  It is anticipated that award of the contract will be in May 2005.    Contact person for this solicitation is the Contracting Office Greg McSweeney, located at the General Services Administration Regional Office, 450 Golden Gate Ave, 3rd Floor West, San Francisco, CA 94102, Telephone (415) 522-3121.  The procurement is open to both large and small businesses under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Before the award of the contract the selected firm (if a large business) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established national subcontracting goals of 40% for Small Businesses, 13% for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 6% for Small Women-owned Businesses, 2.5% for HUB Zone Businesses, 9% for Section 8(a) Businesses and 3% for Service Disabled Veteran-owned Businesses.  In support of the agency’s efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above goals.  The use of subcontractor consultants will be reflected in a Small Business Subcontracting Plan to be submitted upon request by the Contracting Officer.  Firms must provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women owned, and Veteran owned businesses.  An agreeable subcontracting plan must be agreed to prior to award.

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS RFP MAY BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE RESEARCH CONTRACTS BRANCH (RCB) HOMEPAGE AT http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/   Once you are in the website: double click on "Current Requests for Proposals".  INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE RFP SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITAION AND AMENDMENTS, IF ANY.  The Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), Immunocompromised Host Section, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that the contractor provide veterinary and laboratory animal care, assessments, and transportation of rabbits.  The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel, facilities, material, and equipment to provide for the care, laboratory acclimation, assessment, and delivery of farm bred rabbits.  The contractor shall provide for the daily care of rabbits transferred from a breeding colony, ensure their acclimation to a laboratory environment, and deliver them in good health to the Clinical Center located on the Bethesda, Maryland campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  An estimated 36 healthy rabbits per month (432 per year) shall be required to be delivered with a flexibility of 25 to 45 rabbits per month.  Offerors submitting proposals must have (or provide evidence that they can establish prior to award) the ability to provide the requested service within 24 hours.  Mandatory criteria: The offeror must demonstrate the ability to respond to requests on a short notice at the facility at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland campus.  It is necessary for the offeror to be located within approximately one-half hour from the NIH, Bethesda campus in order to minimize the travel time for the rabbits.  Experience has indicated that when rabbits are transported for more than an extended period of time that stress-associated morbidity and mortality increase substantially.  Thus, the close proximity to the NIH campus will improve laboratory animal health and reduce costs due to attrition.  This procurement represents a recompetition of N01-RC-17000, whichis being performed by Biooqual, Inc.  It is anticipated that one fixed price type contract will be awarded for a base period of one year, with four one-year option periods.  The RFP N02-RC-57015-30 will be issued on or about March 31, 2005, and due approximately 30 days after the issue date.  No collect calls will be accepted.

The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  Previous BOA holders must reapply and meet all stated requirements of this announcement.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage firms that are serviced by a specified SBA District Office.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  NAICS Codes 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either Eligible or Ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protégé firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 1 April 2005; be assigned to a SBA Business Opportunity Specialist from one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); and have a bona-fide address within the same district as the Business Opportunity Specialist; (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) within the last three years.

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a pasture facility to maintain wild horses.  The facility must be located in one of the following states:  Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma or Iowa.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:  Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program. Some of the horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are currently being cared for by Noyes Enterprises in Cassody, Kansas. b.  The purpose of this contract is to continue the maintenance of these animals for the remainder of their lives. The possibility exists that more unadoptable animals will be removed from the range and transported to the facility.  This is not the preferred management method for these animals, however, on occasion it will be necessary to place animals at the facility, on an as needed basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act (Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following Criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This will require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the Cassody, Kansas facility during the course of the contract. All animals that are in to poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanly destroyed to avoid undo suffering. All mares that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. The horses currently being maintained at the Cassody facility are a non-reproductive herd consisting of primarily older horses in the age range of 6 to 30 years old. They consist of mares and foals. Some of these horses have been maintained at the Cassody facility for approximately 5 years. The objectives of this contract are: a. To maintain the unadopted excess wild horses currently located at the Cassody facility in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; b. To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manor that falls under the criterion of saleable animals. c. To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; d. To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; e. Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. The following are the required general services: The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks. a. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a maximum of 2,000 wild horses to graze in pastures.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, or when other circumstances warrant). b. Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis. c. Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. d. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. e. Gather and hold horses that fall under the criterion of saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment. f. Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw any needed blood samples prior to shipment. g.  Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations. h.  Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI. i. Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210.  This solicitation will be available on or about March 17, 2005.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>1) Overview

The United States Postal Service’s Package Services group intends to implement a turn-key solution for expedited packaging supplies fulfillment that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves the overall customer ordering experience with regard to supplies.  A vendor will be selected to warehouse packaging supplies inventory, interface with a USPS customer care center to accept orders and communicate order status, act as a liaison on behalf of the Postal Service with various manufacturers of packaging supplies for direct-vendor delivery, and ship orders from its own facilities.  The selected vendor will be further required to maintain order information, and produce summary reports to facilitate product assortment and operational decisions. 

‘Expedited packaging supplies’ refers to those items offered to customers at no additional charge for use with premier USPS services—Express Mail, Priority Mail, and global delivery services.  The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.  Currently, the Postal Service offers customers a total of 68 different packaging-related items.  On average, approximately 162,000 supplies orders, which contain 3.82 items per order, are fulfilled each month.  Of these, approximately 29,000 are orders for one of five different custom-imaged labels.  These items are offered to further enhance customer convenience, and are imaged with 7 to 20 lines of variable text.  The average label order contained 249 labels.

The expedited packaging supplies program is a significant source of customer value and affects customer perception toward the premier offerings of the Postal Service.  Customers place orders for supplies via multiple channels, and this important experience—from order placement through receipt of the supplies order—affects the customer’s perception toward the use of the services themselves.  The supplies fulfillment process, depending on the speed and accuracy with which it is administered, can serve to enhance, or detract from, customer retention.  The fulfillment center is an important part of this dynamic.

Though an important selling tool, the supplies program also carries considerable costs to administer.  For this reason, customer value must be balanced against the cost to the Postal Service of achieving it.  The solution planned seeks to achieve this balance, minimizing costs, while maintaining solid customer support.  To this end, Package Services seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who demonstrate extensive experience in the fulfillment industry, with world-class operations, comprehensive information systems, and a commitment to quality.  A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall reconfiguration, and afford opportunity for one or more strategic partnerships.   

2)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

3)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued consulting services of Dr. Jane Zapka, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, MA 01655.  The ARP administers The International Breast Cancer Screening Network (IBSN), a voluntary consortium of individuals charged with evaluating breast cancer screening within countries that have active population-based screening mammography programs.  The consortium was established in December 1988 with representatives from 11 countries. The consortium has since grown to encompass 25 countries.  The IBSN holds biennial meetings and in the interim, the specific activities of the IBSN are moved forward through working groups. Working groups have collected information to describe policy and guidelines used within programs, to summarize the extent of quality assurance activities related to technical quality, personnel performance, data collection and follow-up activities, and most recently to compare select measures of performance and outcomes such as late stage disease and mortality among participating countries.  At the 2002 meeting of the IBSN, participants discussed the need to evaluate women's communication and decision making needs related to mammography screening -- a convergence of need in nearly all countries driven in large part by the recent scientific and media debate on the benefit and risk of mammography screening.  Over the past two years the IBSN Decision Making and Risk Communications working group, in which Dr. Zapka was a participant, completed a study about communication tools and the group has produced two papers on the results of their work, and Dr. Zapka was the lead author on one of them.  At the meeting in 2004 it was decided that it was important to develop a “how-to” manual based on the state of the art in the literature and in practice that would provide guidance for communication tool development to countries with cancer screening programs. The manual is intended to be developed in draft form for review by the group at the next biennial meeting of the group planned for May 2006.  In order to complete this work Dr. Zapka will continue to work on the IBSN Decision Making and Risk Communications working group to develop the manual.  Dr. Zapka has a doctoral degree in health administration and over 25 years of research experience in primary care and prevention services, with a focus on program evaluation, quality improvement, managed care and other health services research areas.  She is an active member of the International Breast Screening Network (IBSN) and this work requires someone with extensive knowledge of the goals and operations of the IBSN who is familiar with the background of the development of the “how-to” manual.   All this makes her uniquely qualified to provide expert consultation to this project.  These services are the continuation of an ongoing collaborative project of the IBSN Decision Making Risk Communications working group and NCI on evaluating breast cancer screening which is being continued and elaborated upon.  Dr. Zapka is the only known source to the NCI researchers with this knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researchers to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on March 17, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Small Business set-aside contract will be for a one-year period not-to-exceed $1,000,000 for the base year and four one-year options, each not-to-exceed $1,000,000, for a total not-to-exceed contract amo unt of $5,000,000 for the life of the contract.  The unrestricted contract awards will be for a one-year period not-to-exceed $1,000,000 for the base year and two one-year options, each not-to-exceed $1,000,000, for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of  $3,000,000 for the life of the contract.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  All p ricing schedules (base year, and all option years) will be effective for one full year regardless of the early exercising of options.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year's 12-month performance p eriod and the G overnment has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised.  Task Orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount, or as otherwise stat ed in this announcement.  All small business firms responding MUST state in their response their intention to participate in the unrestricted contract as well as the small business set-aside contract.  If a small business is silent on this issue, the small  business will be considered only for the small business set-aside selection and will NOT be considered in the unrestricted selection.  No one contractor will receive more than one award.  All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 and/or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small dis advantaged businesses.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  The price of any single task order shall be at least $5,000.00, but shall not exceed $800,000.00.  The guaranteed minimum s hall be $10,000 for the base period only.  There shall be no guaranteed minimum for the option periods, if exercised.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services, which extend more than 150 miles outside the geographic boundaries of t he San Francisco District.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the emplo yees office location (not the location of the work).  All interested A-Es are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum  practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged businesses.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  The recommended goal for the work intended to be subcontracted is 50.9% for small business.  Out of the 50.9% to small business, 8.8% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.2% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 2.9 for HUBZ one small business (subset to small business) and .05% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business (subset to small business).  Any large business firm selected for this contract will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later  date.  If the selected firm submits a plan with less than the Corps recommended goals, it must submit, in writing, an acceptable rationale why the recommended goals cannot be met, which rationale indicates that at the time the selected firm submitted its  SF330 there was genuine belief that the goals would be virtually met and planning proceeded accordingly.  The Corps will negotiate the goals if it deems appropriate, and will vacate the selection if it deems the firm was disingenuous in representing itsel f as committed to high small business subcontracting goals at the outset.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330.  To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A) Defense Operations  Sector (DOS) Air Corps Plans Team requests assistance in identifying candidate  solutions for  Presidential Airlift (PA) for the Islamic Government of  Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD).  OMC-A is supporting the newly  established Islamic Government of Afghanistan (IGOA) to develop the MOD and  the Afghan National Army (ANA), which includes an Army Air Corps. The first  approved Air Corps mission is to obtain a Presidential Airlift capability to  transport the President within the country’s borders by Oct 2005.  The OMC-A  Air Corps Plans Team is interested in obtaining information from industry on  innovative, cost effective, enduring solutions that will form the basis of an  organic Afghan PA capability, and that have inherent flexibility or  scalability to support additional potential ANA Air Corps missions. See attachment for all details. This RFI should provide no basis for speculation that a Government contract  may result from any information submitted or that it will entitle the  submitter of the information any special consideration for any future business  with the Air Force.  The USG does not presently intend to award a contract,  but wants to obtain price, delivery, and other market information, or  capabilities for planning purposes.  The information obtained as the result of  this RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a  solicitation.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request  for proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States  government (USG).  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted  by the USG to form a binding contract.

<CONTACT>Mauricio Vazquez, Contracting Officer, Phone 732-427-0566 ext. 3014, Fax null, Email mauricio.vazquez@iraq.centcom.mil
<DESC>QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY VARIOUS INTERESTED CONTRACTORS

1.  I would like to inquire if a tanker ship docked in a harbor in Iraq with a on-board bottling facility capable of meeting all your locations needs would be adequate. We have the capability of having such a floating bottling facility put in place which will be filled by an ocean going tanker-ship directly from our source in Norway?
     ANSWER:  We are looking at all options, but a tanker docked 
              in a harbor will not do.  The intent of this 
              bottled water capability is to reduce convoys and 
              ultimately save Soldiers’ lives.  Currently, we 
              truck our bottled water from KU, Jordan, and 
              Turkey.  So a tanker docked in a harbor (only Iraq 
              harbor I am aware of is Um Qasar…south Iraq) will 
              not reduce the convoys on the road.  It’ll still 
              be long haul verses a local haul that will occur 
              at some places.   

2.  Are all eight sites getting its bottle water form one source or plant?  
     ANSWER:  No.  The water is bottled from different sources 
              outside of Iraq and transported in.  This is what 
              we want to avoid.

3.  Are we shipping the water to each site or do we deliver the water to each site?  
     ANSWER:  Each bottled water capability must be physically 
              located on the sites indicated in IZ.  The 
              government will be responsible to transport and 
              distribute the bottled water produced on the sites 
              identified to the respective units.  

4.  How often to you want the water tested for quality?  
     ANSWER:  It will be randomly tested by the Government and 
              whatever times are required via USDA and FDA 
              requirements.  I would assume you already have 
              some standard.

5.  What test do you want run and drinking water?  
      ANSWEWR:  Not sure what the question is…the test ran on 
                the water must meet the USDA and FDA 
                requirements as you mention in question 4.

6.  When can we come out to the site and inspect it? 
     ANSWER:  Yes, most definitely  If the vendor believes he 
              can meet the requirements that we are asking for 
              then the vendor can come when ever to inspect the 
              sites.  But we do want to know whether or not he 
              can meet the requirements laid out and the 
              timeline. 

7.  Who will own the water plant?  
     ANSWER:  All equipment will be owned by the contractor  The 
              intent is for the government to own the 
              equipment.  But if the contractor only considers 
              leasing the equipment, then the contractor must 
              operate the water bottling capability within the 
              limits of the SOW.  If leasing is what the 
              contractor is looking at then negotiations can 
              occur.

<DESC>Questions and answers pertaining to Solicitation FA4486-05-R-0005

1)  T-572, can the door be put on the outside of the facility?
Answer:  YES.     NOTE: If the door is to be installed on the inside exact, dimensions of existing door do not have to be met, would like to see submittals first. 
2)  T-606, Just to clarify, the minimum height of the only door being replaced must be 14' 
Confirmation:  YES
3)  B-572, there is no space to install the door on the inside of the building because there is a mezanine floor in the way.  Should the contractor do the necessary modifications in order to accomodate the new door.  
Answer: YES, if the door is going on the outside. At this point it looks like outside installation is the preferable method.
4)  Bldg T-216 has five roll-up doors.  Scope of work states to remove and replace four doors.  Please clarify and indicate which are to be removed.  
Answer:  Only four doors, entry door, first door on left as you enter the building, both tire shop doors.
5)  Bldg T-611, Two doors on the east side of the building have block glass windows located above the doors.  Are the they to be replaced with CMU block?
Answer: NEGATIVE. Just the one at T-606
6)  We don't have any indication of where we're going to get power for the doors and the 
location of the panels.
Answer:  Power requirements are not available in T-611; therefore, use standard
mechanical rolling doors instead.
7)  Do we have to install a safety switch on each door.
Answer:  All roll-up doors must have safety switches and a manual chain as well
8)  Which is the voltage and the Cycles.
Answer:  all electrical door motors will be 50Hz
9)  In the existing panels, are there spare circuit breakers.
Answer: T-715 existing electrical panel is located within 15ft of existing door and spare breakers are available.  T-216  3 existing doors are all electrical operated and can be tied into the existing electrical panels.  One (1) electrical door was replaced with a manual door, but was at one time electric. New conduit would have to be run and wire pulled to power this door and spare breaker is available.

<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action   for the purpose of extending the ordering and performance periods for the Reconnaissance, Intelligence Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services (RPS) contracts with Lockheed Martin Corp. (F19628-97-D-0008) and Raytheon Corp. (F196280-97-D-0009).  The contracts' ordering periods will be increased by three years  by changing the current ending date from 31 December 03 to 31 December 06.  The contracts' periods of performance will also be increased by three years  by changing the current ending date from 31 December 04 to 31 December 07.  This change will not increase the ceiling price of the two contracts.  The extension is a contract action required to provide for the acquisition of upgrades to existing subsystems, Ground Control Processor (GCP) and Deployable Ground Intercept Facility (DGIF), which were developed and fielded by the aforementioned contractors, as parts of the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS).  The anticipated upgrade candidate planned for functional integration into the two subsystems is the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP).  The ASIP sensor program is a development effort centered on providing a near-term SIGINT capability on-board the Air Force Special and Global Hawk platforms.  Its development period will proceed thru 2007. The scope of the subject RPS contract is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades.  The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as the only holders of RPS contracts under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". <br><br> Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Diane O'Neil, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-2388; Theresa Barmashi, Contract Negotiator, (781) 377-3539; or Captain Bren O'Connor, Program Manager, (781) 377-5562. <br><br> This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP). Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offerors. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.

<DESC>MOD: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  The following information is provided to assist the United States Navy in conducting a Market Research of Industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully perform T-34C/T-44A/T-6A Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) requirements for approximately 308 T-34C, 54 T-44A, and from 48 (FY06) to 120 (FY10) T-6A aircraft. 

The T-34C is a non-pressurized, fixed-wing, two-place (tandem) aircraft manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company.  The mission of the 287 T-34C aircraft assigned to the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) is to provide primary flight training to student naval aviators.  These T-34C aircraft are located at NAS Whiting Field, FL and NAS Corpus Christi, TX.  In addition, twenty-one T-34C aircraft are assigned to AIRLANT, AIRPAC, NAWC, NASA, and the Army and are used for range clearance/coordination, tactical strike observation, chase/pace/spotter, pilot proficiency, competitive exercise observer platforms and to perform Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) of various projects.  The T-44A is a twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place aircraft manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company.  The primary mission of the 54 T-44A aircraft assigned to CNATRA and located at NAS Corpus Christi, TX is to train student naval aviators to fly multi-engine turbo-prop aircraft.   The T-6A is a pressurized, ejection seat, On Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS) equipped, fixed-wing, stepped tandem seat aircraft manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company.  Forty-eight T-6A aircraft will be assigned at NAS Pensacola.   An additional seventy-two  aircraft will arrive at NAS Whiting Field between FY08 and FY10.  The T-34C aircraft inventory will decrease during the period of performance as additional T-6A aircraft are procured.  

This contract effort is a re-competition for T-34C and T-44A Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services and maintenance requirements currently provided under Contract N00019-00-D-0179.   The Navy’s T-6A CLS services and maintenance requirements will also be included in this re-competition. The length of contract award will be a base year award and 4 option periods.  This contract effort will address the procurement of contractor maintenance, modifications, and logistics support services necessary to provide organizational through depot level support for all Navy T-34C/T-44A/T-6A aircraft.  The support concept for these Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) aircraft is total commercial maintenance at the organizational, intermediate, and depot levels.  The aircraft shall be maintained in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) maintenance plan and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.  If awarded, the contract would include the following types of effort:  1) aircraft line maintenance, launch and recovery services, 2) aircraft scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, 3) component repair (T-34C/T-44A only), 4) material management, 5) Aircraft Condition Inspection (ACI) (T-34C/T-44A only), 6) aircraft depot repair, 7) engineering support services, 8) quality assurance, 9) satellite site support, 10) engine overhaul and repair (T-34C/T-44A only), 11) propeller overhaul (T-34C/T-44A only), 12) support equipment maintenance, 13) aviation life support systems maintenance, 14) aircraft modifications, and 15) landing gear overhaul (T-34C/T-44A only).  

The Navy anticipates structuring the Request for Proposal (RFP) to allow for one (1) award for T-34C/T-44A/T-6A requirements.  The period of performance will cover a one-year base period and four, one-year options. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a draft Section B of the proposed solicitation should be released to industry in March 2005.  Formal RFP release is planned for June 2005 with proposals due back in August 2005.  Award is planned for the October - December 2005 timeframe.  Interested parties should review these documents as they are released and provide any comments via email to this office. The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Any company that would like to be added to the source list for this requirement should express their interest in writing. Please include a company pamphlet, brochure, or short statement of your company’s ability/history with this type of service, the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company’s address.  Maximum of two (2) typed pages.  The Navy will consider and respond to all inputs received.  Industry response is encouraged to ensure all parties have maximum opportunity to participate in this acquisition.  The Navy plans to use the Internet and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information.  All interested parties should access the Naval Air Systems Command’s web site at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Please note all prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) data base http://www.ccr.gov in order to participate in this potential procurement.  If you have already responded to this Sources Sought Synopsis, no further response is necessary or required. Written responses must be submitted by 15 March 2005, to NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, 21983 Bundy Road, Unit #7, BLDG 441, ATTN:  Helen Dawson, T-34C/T-44A Program (AIR-2.3.1.3.3), Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127.

<SOLNBR>N62467-05-R-0095
<RESPDATE>040605
<ARCHDATE>04212005
<CONTACT>Adam Solivan, Contract Specialist, Phone 843-820-5677, Fax null, Email adam.solivan@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH THE SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED ONE OR MORE SEED PROJECTS AS TASK ORDER(S) UNDER THE CONTRACT.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offeror’s must also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Overview

The United States Postal Service’s Package Services group intends to implement a turn-key solution for expedited packaging supplies fulfillment that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves the overall customer ordering experience with regard to supplies.  A vendor will be selected to warehouse packaging supplies inventory, interface with a USPS customer care center to accept orders and communicate order status, act as a liaison on behalf of the Postal Service with various manufacturers of packaging supplies for direct-vendor delivery, and ship orders from its own facilities.  The selected vendor will be further required to maintain order information, and produce summary reports to facilitate product assortment and operational decisions. 

‘Expedited packaging supplies’ refers to those items offered to customers at no additional charge for use with premier USPS services—Express Mail, Priority Mail, and global delivery services.  The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.  Currently, the Postal Service offers customers a total of 68 different packaging-related items.  On average, approximately 162,000 supplies orders, which contain 3.82 items per order, are fulfilled each month.  Of these, approximately 29,000 are orders for one of five different custom-imaged labels.  These items are offered to further enhance customer convenience, and are imaged with 7 to 20 lines of variable text.  The average label order contained 249 labels.

The expedited packaging supplies program is a significant source of customer value and affects customer perception toward the premier offerings of the Postal Service.  Customers place orders for supplies via multiple channels, and this important experience—from order placement through receipt of the supplies order—affects the customer’s perception toward the use of the services themselves.  The supplies fulfillment process, depending on the speed and accuracy with which it is administered, can serve to enhance, or detract from, customer retention.  The fulfillment center is an important part of this dynamic.

Though an important selling tool, the supplies program also carries considerable costs to administer.  For this reason, customer value must be balanced against the cost to the Postal Service of achieving it.  The solution planned seeks to achieve this balance, minimizing costs, while maintaining solid customer support.  To this end, Package Services seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who demonstrate extensive experience in the fulfillment industry, with world-class operations, comprehensive information systems, and a commitment to quality.  A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall reconfiguration, and afford opportunity for one or more strategic partnerships.   

2)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

3)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

4)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year's 12-month performance p eriod and the Gov ernment has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised.  Task Orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount, or as otherwise stated  in this announcement.  All small business firms responding MUST state in their response their intention to participate in the unrestricted contract as well as the small business set-aside contract.  If a small business is silent on this issue, the small b usiness will be considered only for the small business set-aside selection and will NOT be considered in the unrestricted selection.  No one contractor will receive more than one award.  All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance wi th the provisions of FAR sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 and/or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small disad vantaged businesses.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  The price of any single task order shall be at least $5,000.00, but shall not exceed $800,000.00.  The guaranteed minimum sha ll be $10,000 for the base period only.  There shall be no guaranteed minimum for the option periods, if exercised.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services, which extend more than 150 miles outside the geographic boundaries of the  San Francisco District.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employe es office location (not the location of the work).  All interested A-Es are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum p racticable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged businesses.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  The recommended goal fo r the work intended to be subcontracted is 50.9% for small business.  Out of the 50.9% to small business, 8.8% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.2% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 2.9 for HUBZon e small business (subset to small business) and .05% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business (subset to small business).  Any large business firm selected for this contract will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later d ate.  If the selected firm submits a plan with less than the Corps recommended goals, it must submit, in writing, an acceptable rationale why the recommended goals cannot be met, which rationale indicates that at the time the selected firm submitted its S F330 there was genuine belief that the goals would be virtually met and planning proceeded accordingly.  The Corps will negotiate the goals if it deems appropriate, and will vacate the selection if it deems the firm was disingenuous in representing itself as committed to high small business subcontracting goals at the outset.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330.  To be eligible for contract award a firm or  joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

Digital Spatial Data:  Digital mapping, generation of Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) systems and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Land Information System (LIS), Automated Mapping/Facility Management (A M/FM) and other spatial databases; d.  Ground survey control support.  If datum conversions are required, conversions will be provided by district or contractor will submit proposed conversions to district for approval prior to use, as dictated by task ord er.  The software program Vertcon cannot be used for converting between datums without special, written approval from the district.  C.  Aerial Photography and Photogrammetry Mapping Surveys:  All aerial photography and surveys shall be conducted during lo w tide unless otherwise indicated in individual Task Order.  a.  Aerial Photography; b.  Photogrammetric Mapping; c.  Digital Spatial Data; d.  Ground survey control support; e.  Standard Line Mapping.  D. Boundary Surveys:  A Boundary Survey will indicate  the extent of any easements, burdening the locus parcel, such as an utility line easement crossing the subject property to a neighboring property or appurtenant to the locus parcel.  E.  CADD and GIS Data:  Rather than representing a surface as a collecti on of point elevations, CADD and GIS represent features as geometries: points, lines or polygons.  The geometries have attributes (properties) such as these.  Feature- i.e vegetation; polygon; road; and Attributes  vegetation type; width, name; and height , address.  GIS is preferable for attributed data or for vector data that is to be processed or analyzed geospatially.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources, industry comments, and product information for the acquisition of the development and deployment of a Re-systemized Metrology and Calibration (METCAL) Information System (RMIS) for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Metrology Automated System for Uniform Recall and Reporting (MEASURE) Program Office (MPO). Navy and Marine Corps METCAL Information Systems (METCAL IS). The METCAL IS supports the business processes for the Department of the Navy (DoN) metrology and calibration services enterprise. The user organizations that comprise the enterprise are NAVAIR, Marine Corps System Command (MARCOR), Naval Space and Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) including Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) and Strategic Systems Programs (SSP). The calibration business processes of these organizations are relatively common; the differences are driven by mission requirements. RMIS will replace legacy Navy and Marine Corps METCAL Information Systems (METCAL IS). It will fix the performance problems of the legacy systems, be web enabled, and support the enterprise more completely by including additional capabilities in the business areas of finance, management, and production job control. The data gathered by the RMIS will be used for DoN program budgets, calibration facility workload planning and analyses, configuration change documentation, reliability analyses, interval analysis, engineering studies, and to trace measurements from the end user to standards maintained by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). RMIS will recall, track, and report status of all Navy and Marine Corps metrology assets throughout their life cycle. It will capture the history of calibration and repair events on each asset as it completes its calibration cycles. This data will be used for asset life cycle metrology engineering. RMIS will report work in process, status, inventory, history, readiness, business, and financial information for laboratory and asset managers at all command echelons within the DoN. RMIS will provide calibration laboratory / facility managers the capability to manage their business activities such as production planning, scheduling, and control; resource loading and workforce skills management functions. There are interface requirements to time, attendance, and payroll (civilian and military) applications. The scope of operations is worldwide, current legacy Automated Information Systems (AIS) applications provide services for Navy and Marine Corps laboratories in the continental United States, shore facilities overseas, and deployed fleet units. DoN sponsors approximately 500 calibration laboratories ashore and afloat ranging from one technician on afloat units to well over 100 technicians at larger depot level maintenance facilities. The central objective of the system is to provide an enterprise capability for all DoN calibration facilities to carry out the business of calibrating and centrally managing Test and Monitoring Systems (TAMS), Test, Monitoring and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) and calibration standards using a single information knowledge management system. The goal is to provide a single integrated METCAL AIS that is common to all Navy organizations performing calibration and /or calibration management that will 1) Support to the Navy-wide set of calibration business rules, 2) allow data access to all users according to their needs, 3) Improve data quality, 4) Provide a single point bench-top or portable-unit data entry with simplified user interface, 4) Make available the necessary and specific calibration data at the technician's fingertips, 5) Provide near real-time performance and system-wide data synchronization, 6) Provide laboratory management functions, 7) Have the capability of capturing all calibration data whether manually or automatically generated, 8) Capability to develop inventory packages for units leaving geographic area, and  9) Control data and functionality at the units while deployed.  Detailed information about the RMIS is available upon request from the MEASURE Program Office.  The MPO is interested in technology that can provide the capabilities required.  The MPO and the METCAL AIS Standing Committee may hold an industry day to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents. Details will be made available at a later date to the respondents of this RFI, if an industry day is held. It is requested that 4 copies of that information be submitted via U.S. Mail or Overnight/Express mail service, NO LATER THAN 03 June 2005 to Joanne Southworth, Rt. 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5104. Electronic or Facsimile copies will NOT be accepted. Ms. Southworth can be reached at (732) 323-2756 or Email: joanne.southworth@navy.mil. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the Government.

<DESC>1.0  Description 1.1  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the potential development of Business Process Management Tools for Chemical Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Planning and Decision Support. 1.2  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes â€“ it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever, however, any information obtained through this RFI may be used, at the Governmentâ€™s discretion, for a future RFP or Broad  Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitiation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. 1.3 Interested parties are requested to provide a written response to this RFI.  Parties may include industry, government, and academic institutions. 2.0  Background 2.1  The Joint Operational Effects Federation (JOEF) is a program managed by the Joint Program Manager, Information Systems (JPM IS) within the Joint Program Executive Office (PEO) Chemical, Biological Defense (PEO-CBD).  The mission of JOEF is to support planning and decisionâ€“making for Chemical Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (CBRND).  For the purposes of this RFI, CBRND includes defenses against releases of toxic industrial materials (TIM).  JOEF will be used for strategic, operational, and tactical planning, course of action selection, and timely decision support in both deliberate and crisis planning situations.  It is to be compliant with Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system standards, and hosted on Common Operating Environment (COE) C4I networked-systems, such as the Global Command and Control System, Joint (GCCS-J), as well as non-networked workstations. 2.2  JOEF is required to help the Strategic and Operational Commanderâ€™s CBRND staff carry out complex planning and decision support tasks.  In many cases there are existing Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) that describe how these tasks should be carried out, what factors to consider, algorithms for making certain choices, etc.  Computer-based tools that guide users through these complex procedures and eliminate redundant operator inputs and decisions could enable JOEF users to perform their planning tasks better, faster, and more efficiently. While there are Joint TTPs that lay out the general procedures for accomplishing some tasks, we expect the Services and even individual commands to have their own standard operating procedures based on lessons-learned experience that require specifically tailored processes to achieve maximum effectiveness.  So, in addition to a standard set of Joint â€œAutomated TTPsâ€, we need to provide users the flexibility to define and follow their own specialized plans and TTPs and then have JOEF help them through their own processes. The following table contains a sample list of candidate TTPs that could be automated for the JOEF Business Process Management Tools. Table 1.  Candidate TTPs for Automation (Sample) Manual #    Title Relevant Section  Figure # of Form  Description FM 3-3      Chemical and Biological Contamination Avoidance Appendix C: Reproducible Forms      --    2 Chem/Bio attack forms; Forms NBC-1 through NBC-6 FM 3-7      NBC Field Handbook      Appendix D: Tactical Operations     D-3   Standard Range Card (DA Form 5517-R) Air Force Manual 32 4017      Civil Engineer Readiness Technicianâ€™s Manual For Nuclear, Biological, And Chemical Defense      Chapter 6.  NBC Defense Actions â€“ Deployment, Employment (Pre, Trans-Attack)           Procedures, flow charts, check lists, and explanatory information FM 3-14     Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Vulnerability Analysis    All         Procedures, flow charts, check lists, and explanatory information FM 3-11.34  Multiservice Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Defense of Theater Fixed Sites, Ports, and Airfields      Appendix C, Vulnerability Analysis and MitigationAppendix D,Fixed Site Defense Planning Tools       Procedures, flow charts, check lists, and explanatory information 3.0  Requirement 3.1  For respondents providing information regarding development of Business Process Management Tools for CBRND Planning and Decision Support, we are soliciting information regarding planning and decision support tools to assist users at fixed or mobile sites in: 1.    Storing and displaying Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and planning documents. 2.    Searching and displaying information from stored TTPs and planning documents in response to user-defined search criteria 3.    Identifying the appropriate plans and/or TTPs for user-defined CBRND tasks and situations in a computer file directory containing many plans and/or TTPs. 4.    Guiding users through the execution of chosen plans and/or TTPs to quickly and efficiently accomplish assigned tasks, respond to CBRN and TIM events, or manage event consequences.  To guide the user through the steps of a process, the tool should be able to: a.    display the steps to be taken, b.    display what steps have already been taken, c.    display which additional steps can logically be taken given the current state of process completion d.    provide user choices where pertinent, and display the adapted remaining steps that most efficiently meet objectives. e.    automatically fill in required data, when available, from defined sources (databases, web services, and other applications). 5.    Creating new or modifying existing plans and/or TTPs with new processes and procedures to meet the needs of individual Services and commands. 3.2  The JPM IS is interested in determining what products meeting the above criteria exist in the marketplace.  This market-knowledge information will be used to help determine a strategy for a possible future acquisition.  Upon review of submissions, JPM IS may request additional descriptive information in the form of a questionnaire regarding those systems with potential applicability to JOEF.  Upon review of submissions, briefings and demonstrations may also be requested.  However, respondents to this announcement are NOT obligated to provide any additional information, briefings, or demonstrations.  Invited briefings or demonstrations may be scheduled as early as two to three weeks after white paper due date at either respondent/developer designated sites, or in locations designated by the JOEF Program Office (i.e. Washington, DC or San Diego, CA).  Demonstrations will be expected, at a minimum, to provide government evaluators with an opportunity to examine the proposed system and observe its application to Business Process Management Tools for CBRND Planning And Decision Support. 3.3  This announcement invites information regarding existing software packages with the potential for use in JOEF for storing and displaying TTPs and planning documents, performing context-based searches to identify the appropriate TTPs and plans associated with user-specified tasks or operational events, and providing computer-based assistance in executing the plan or TTP.  We are particularly interested in tools that are well documented and are currently used independently of the developer by commercial, government, or military customers. 4.0  White Paper Submissions 4.1  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a White paper no later than 17 March 2005, 3:00 p.m. PST. 4.2  White papers submissions shall be Microsoft Office 2000 compatible or Adobe PDF format.  Parties responding to this announcement shall provide the systemâ€™s name, owner, contact information, developer name, a brief description of the proposed candidate system including identification of any proprietary components, and a statement explaining why it is applicable to JOEF.  There is no limit on the number of candidate systems a party can propose; however, there is a â€œone-page per system" limitation. 4.3  All interested parties shall submit their inputs to Heidi Radaford, Code 02-22P, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, Contract Office (4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127), via e-mail only at heidi.radaford@navy.mil.

<DESC>US Army's upcoming re-procurement of 9-11 Cu. Yd. Scrapers and 2,500 gallon Water Distributors. The intent is to combine the procurement of scrapers and water distributors under one contract. This questionnaire is to aid in determining the suitabilit y of your equipment (with minor modification if necessary). There are two configurations.  Type I - Non-Sectionalized (Air Transportable and Air-Drop-Able by  C-130 aircraft) Type II  Sectionalized (Airborne Transportable, Air-Drop-Able and Helicopter Transportable)  These new vehicles are intended to replace the Armys current fleet of over-age Scrapers and Water Distributors. 	In order to maximize interchangeability of parts, both Type I and II configurations of the Scraper and Water Distributor should be the same base commercial model and have the same prime mover.  The scraper should be capable of being moved with the Water D istributor's prime mover, and vise versa.  The Type II configuration is intended to be an air-drop-able machine with the additional capability of easily being divided into two sections for helicopter transport (maximum weight per section of 16,600 lbs.) as  well as easily reassembled once placed in theater. The scraper must be self-propelled and capable of completing construction and earthmoving tasks. These tasks include, but are not limited to moving, grading and excavating earth, blast rock, loose sand, aggregate, and soil involved with military earth movi ng operations in support of construction of roads, bridges, airfields and for airborne and airmobile operations.  The water distributor must be self-propelled and capable of spreading non-potable water on soil for compaction operations, soil stabilization and dust control.  It should be equipped with a self priming pump capable of drawing water from creeks, ponds, etc . without priming. The latest purchase description (ATPD-2310, dated 25 March 2003) is located with the market survey. Any supplemental information concerning the performance, human factors engineering/safety, reliability/maintainability etc., of your products or any other l iterature concerning your companies warranty program, production longevity, and reputation would be useful in this survey.   http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm

<SUBJECT>A -- Silymarin Product Development Program for use in NIH-Sponsored Clinical Trial for Liver Diseases
<DESC>•<B>DESCRIPTION</b>:  The  National  Center  for  Complementary  and
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)  and the National Institute  of
Diabetes  and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)  of  the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and of the Department of
Health  and  Human  Services (DHHS) seek collaboration  with
industry to participate in the Silymarin Product Development
Program  for use of silymarin, derived from the milk thistle
plant Silybum marianum, in NIH-sponsored clinical trials for
liver diseases.<P>

<B>•INTRODUCTION</b>:

The   National  Center  for  Complementary  and  Alternative
Medicine (NCCAM), in collaboration with other components  of
the  National Institutes of Health of the U.S Department  of
Health  and Human Services, including the National Institute
of Diabetes and  Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is planning
to form a Silymarin Product Development Program (PDP) and  a
Silymarin  Research  Network for Phase  II  clinical  trials
using silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant Silybum
marianum,  for  liver diseases.  The initial  stage  of  the
Silymarin PDP presently is planned to consist of  Phase I/II
dose-ranging  studies for silymarin in one or  more  of  the
following  indications: chronic hepatitis C or non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis.  In addition, Phase I drug-drug interaction
studies are planned. The total number of clinical trials  to
be  performed in the initial stage of the PDP depends on the
following factors: publication of a Request for Applications
(RFA)  for principal investigators to propose such  studies;
peer  review  of  the applications by the  NIH  peer  review
system;  and  further evaluation and changes  in  the  peer-
accepted  protocols  by  an NIH Silymarin  Research  Network
Steering  Committee. The second stage of the  Silymarin  PDP
would consist of a Phase III pivotal trial of silymarin  for
one chosen clinical indication.<P>

A  decision point will occur after the initial stage of  the
Silymarin  PDP.  If  the data from the Phase  I  /II  trials
suggest that proceeding to Phase III is appropriate,  NCCAM,
NIDDK  and  other NIH Institutes or Centers that may  become
involved,  with the input of the selected Collaborator,  are
expected to plan a Phase III pivotal trial.<P>

Therefore, NCCAM and NIDDK are seeking proposals in the form
of  capability  statements from companies to  enter  into  a
collaboration to provide silymarin to support the  Silymarin
Product  Development  Program  and  the  Silymarin  Research
Network. The selected Collaborator will be expected to enter
into  a  Clinical  Trial  Agreement  (CTA)  with  NCCAM.  To
facilitate  the  exchange of information regarding  the  PDP
among  the NIH components and the Collaborator, the selected
Collaborator  will  also  be  expected  to  enter  into   an
appropriate Confidential Disclosure Agreement preliminary to
finalizing a CTA.<P>

<B>•STUDY  GOALS</b>:   The  overall goal of the  Silymarin  Product Development  Program is to evaluate a silymarin  formulation for  treatment  or  prevention  or  progression  of  hepatic disorders. It is unclear at this time if any or all  of  the disorders,    chronic   hepatitis   C   and    non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis,  can  be effectively  aided  by  silymarin.
Therefore,  the  initial stage of the silymarin  PDP  is  to
perform  Phase  I/II  dose-ranging  trials,  and  associated
supportive Phase I studies, in whichever of these  disorders


can  be  reasonably studied. When the results of the initial
stage of the Silymarin PDP are evaluated, a decision will be
made by NCCAM, NIDDK and any other NIH Institutes or Centers
that  may  be  involved, with Collaborator's  input,  as  to
whether  a  Phase  III pivotal trial for any  indication  is
warranted.<P>

<B>•SUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION</b>:  The determination  as  to  which
disorders  should be investigated will be made  through  the
NIH process of publication of an RFA, reception of protocols
in   response  to  the  RFA,  peer-review  of  the  proposed
protocols,  and further refinement of the protocols  by  the
Silymarin Research Network Steering Committee. The  Steering
Committee  will consist of the PIs of the several successful
applications  for the Silymarin Research network  which  may
include  up  to  5  Clinical  Centers  and  a  single   Data
Coordinating  Center.  In addition, the  Steering  Committee
will include NIH personnel, and may include the Collaborator
as  a  non-voting  member. The protocols  contained  in  the
successful  applications for the Silymarin Research  Network
will  be  refined  and finalized by the  Steering  Committee
during  the first year of the awarded Network. The protocols
will  then  be  implemented during years  2  and  3  of  the
Network.<P>

The  Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) into which the  selected
Collaborator  is expected to enter is an agreement  designed
to  enable  a  collaboration between Government laboratories
and  industry. IT IS NOT A GRANT, AND IS NOT A CONTRACT  FOR
THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS OR SERVICES.  The NIH is prohibited
from  transferring funds to a CTA collaborator. Under a CTA,
NIH   can  contribute  facilities,  staff,  materials,   and
expertise   to   the  effort.  The  Collaborator   typically
contributes  materials and expertise to  the  collaboration.
This will be an in-kind collaborative arrangement.<P>

<B>•CAPABILITY  STATEMENTS</b>:  A Selection Committee will  utilize
the  information  provided  in the "Collaborator  Capability
Statements" received  in response to this  announcement  to
help  in its selection of Industry Collaborator. It  is  the
intention   of  the  NCCAM  and  NIDDK  that  all  qualified
Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to
the Selection Committee through their capability statements.
All  Capability Statements will be reviewed by a  scientific
review panel.<P>

The  review  panel will be considering  its  selection
based  upon data in the Capability Statement addressing  the
following  criteria  A-H.  If  no  data  is  available,  the
potential Collaborator should so indicate.<P>

A. CMC CRITERIA<P>

In  general, the details should be in conformity with  FDA's
expert  advice with respect to acceptability for  a  pivotal

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW SHAPE MEMORY POLYMERS (SMP) FOR INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL APPLICATIONS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license new shape memory polymers (SMP) having material properties that exceed those of current SMP’s.

·	LLNL’s new Shape Memory Polymers compositions have mechanical properties that bridge the gap between Shape Memory Alloys and the current crop of SMP’s.

SMP’s belong to a category of products known as smart or intelligent materials that have the ability to change size and shape in response to changes in temperature, moisture, pH, or electric and magnetic fields.  For SMP’s it is temperature.  Using a temperature-dependent process, these polymers can be formed into any shape, reformed into a stable secondary shape, and when stimulated regain the previous “memory” shape to achieve its function.  These materials have variable structure or composition depending on the application.

Although the market is dominated by shape memory alloys (SMA’s), LLNL has developed new SMP compositions having mechanical properties that bridge the gap between SMA’s and the current crop of SMP’s.  Specifically, these new polymers have higher recoverable stresses than existing commercial SMP’s, have superior clarity for optical applications, and still have larger recoverable strains than SMA’s to build devices with highly complex shapes.  These new SMP’s can also be made biodegradable. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's New Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP) technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 102-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's New Shaped Memory Polymer (SMP).

<SUBJECT>A -- Request For Information: Hybrid Reaction Jet Control - Fin Actuation System
<DESC>ADDITIONAL GENERAL INFORMATION

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes.  This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under FAR 31.205-18, "Bid and Proposal Costs."

GENERAL INTENT

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) has recently ground-tested the first flight-weight, reaction jet control (RJC) system for air-to-air missiles.  The RJC technologies demonstrated in this test will provide future missiles with unprecedented maneuverability without degrading beyond-visual-range performance. During this demonstration all performance requirements required for a production RJC system (size, weight, volume, response time and duty cycle) were demonstrated at the component level.  The primary focus of this request is to help identify system level technologies required to integrate a RJC system with the guidance, navigation and control system of an air-to-air missile. Potential technology areas include but are not limited to combined RJC - fin control actuation system, high angle-of-attack aerodynamics and GN&C algorithms for high-off-boresight missile maneuvering.  The goal is the development of these technologies to a level required for flight test activities.  Also sought are approaches for the incremental or spiral development of the required technologies.   The Government is interested in investigating technology areas that are perceived to offer the greatest payoff for achieving a system-level demonstration of highly maneuverable airframes in a stability and control test vehicle (SCTV).  The SCTV is not envisioned to have an active guidance section, but the vehicle will be commanded to achieve certain flight conditions.

This RFI provides interested contractors an opportunity to present to the government their ideas, an approach, and progress made in system level integration technologies.  It is the first step in preparing technology roadmaps for investment planning.  The Government will not respond to those submitting to this RFI except in the case a clarification of the information provided is required by the Government review team. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals, and will not result in a Government contract.  

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION

Responses to this request must be received by the Government no later than close of business 30 March 2005.  Responders shall provide one electronic copy (Microsoft Word or .pdf formats ) and one paper copy of their documentation (five pages or less). Information packages containing more than five pages will be returned, unread, to the sender.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 10 point type, or 12 pitch.  If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then those pages should be marked accordingly.

<SUBJECT>62 -- commercial and military lighting
<DESC>Request for Information
This is not a solicitation.


The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Lighting Team is seeking information in an attempt to restructure our lighting acquisition and logistic mission.  We currently provide logistic and acquisition support for commercial and weapon system lighting products that meet the needs of both federal agencies and military components worldwide.  

The Lighting Team’s annual sales at acquisition that sustain our worldwide customer base exceeded $163M in FY 04.   During the same timeframe we awarded 21,389 contracts.  We also released another 31,000 delivery orders for our lighting products under long-term coverage.  We currently segment our lighting by weapon system lighting (vehicular, aviation and shipboard lighting) and commercial (lamps, bulbs, ballast, flashlights, starters).  Sales of just our commercial lighting products has increased from $32 M in FY 98 to over $60 M in FY 04.   Weapon system lighting acquisition and sales have increased from $58M to $113M over the same time period.  This increase is a direct result of an increasing customer base beyond just military users to other federal activities: the incorporation of tailored logistic support projects and the addition of hundreds of new energy efficient lighting products.  Market advances in lighting technology and innovative logistic support methods at DSCP indicate that this upward sales trend should continue. 


The Commercial Lighting Federal Stock Classes (FSCs) as identified by DSCP include 6230 (Handheld and portable lighting),  6240 (lamps, bulbs) and 6250 (ballast and starters).  The weapon systems FSCs include 6210 (lighting fixtures) and 6220 (vehicular, shipboard and aircraft related lighting parts).  We are seeking information from industry on a potential Prime Vendor/Supplier with the capabilities to provide a variety of lighting products to our DLA designated depots and customer direct.  This Prime Vendor/Supplier (PVS) will need the capability to provide these products by brand name, industry/military standard and commercial description.    The PVS would be responsible for maintaining regional sustainment for our customer’s lighting needs and possibly global support for specific lighting products, or BOTH.

The following product segmentation ideas are only samples of how the Lighting acquisitions can be segmented and by no way should limit any ideas or suggestions.  

1.	Commercial FSC Method: Lighting products segmented into specific classes of lighting.  This segment is National Stock Number (NSN) driven and the PVS will be required to provide product based on NSN requirements and ship to either a DLA depot or customer direct.  PVS could support these NSNs using our two National Industries for the Blind (NIB) depots for storage and distribution.  

2.	Top Customer Method:  The PVS will be required to provide product direct to our top customers who will order by NSN, brand name or standard description.  This method may require multiple awards in order to provide direct customer support.

3.	Industry Segmentation:  Segment lighting products by industry (vehicular lights, aircraft lights, shipboard lights, facility lights, etc.).  These items could be grouped together for large market basket acquisitions. 

 




The information being sought can be either a detailed proposal or a complete outline that will address a new lighting acquisition strategy.  This proposal/outline must establish a supply chain concept that meets our current customer needs as efficiently as possible.  Responses must include the following:  name and address of the company, point of contact, email address and phone number, size of the business; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone and/or woman-owned, and corporate affiliation information.

The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of this request for information.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation For Bid or a Request For Proposal nor should it be considered as a commitment on the part of the Government.

        Information in the form of a written proposal or outline is requested by April 30, 2005.  At that time we will review all submissions and possibly arrange a meeting with those who have submitted proposals to further explore the submitted options.  Questions can be directed to our Lighting SCP Project POCs Tony Armentani (Anthony.Armentani@dla.mil) at 215-737-8047 or Sue Berneski (susan.berneski@dla.mil) at 215-737-4175.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications (Standard Form 171 or Optional Form 612) from U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or third-country nationals (TCNs) interested in providing the services as described in the solicitation that follows.

Submittals shall be in accordance with the attached information at the place and time specified above.


. POSITION DESCRIPTIONS: 


A.	Background:  

Ethiopia 

Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, with a 2003 population estimated at 70 million people from 83 ethnic groups and languages, living in an area almost twice the size of Texas.  There are nine regions and two special administrative areas: the cities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.  Eighty-five percent of the population lives in rural areas.  Almost 4% of the population lives in Addis Ababa, the capital, and another 11% in other urban regional capitals and trade hubs.  

In the early 1990’s the government of Ethiopia devolved power to ethnically based regions. Decentralization remains an important focus of the government and its donor partners.   Financial and other resource allocations to regions from the federal government are based on formulae that recognize need.  

Religion plays a major part in the lives of most Ethiopians and religious networks reach even the most remote parts of the country, although there is not a strong tradition of religious health care or education networks.  Approximately 45% of the population adheres to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; approximately 45% of the population is Muslim; and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestantism and other religious traditions constitute approximately 10% of the population.   There is a long tradition of religious tolerance and harmony.  

Basic living conditions in terms of health, sanitation and nutrition are extremely poor for the majority of the population.  Maternal mortality rates are 871 per 100,000 live births and under-five mortality rates are 188 per 1000.  Half of Ethiopia’s children are underweight for their age and over half are stunted.  Access to health care is limited to 61.3% for public facilities, with an increase to 70.2% when services provided by private facilities are included.  The primary school gross enrollment rate has increased to 65% (40% girls).  This increase in students has affected the quality of education.  The adult literacy rate is 32.8% (26.4% females; 39.3% males). GDP is under US$100 per capita in the past 10 years, making Ethiopia one of the poorest countries on the continent. 

The political and economic environment is fluid and moving forward, albeit at an uneven pace.   The GOE’s recent achievement of highly indebted poor country completion points has significantly reduced external debt, which bodes well for future economic growth.  Continued progress on food security policies and programs affords cautious optimism about improved impact on poverty reduction.  Progressive implementation of decentralization in different sectors yields a constant ebb and flow of center-periphery tensions that affects all sector programs.   National parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 2005, with local elections scheduled for 2006.

The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Ethiopia

Recognizing the emergency that exists in Ethiopia due to the prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS, the joint partners within the U.S. government—the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Defense, under the auspices of the Department of State—have formed an interagency working group for Ethiopia’s AIDS Emergency Plan (ETAEP).  The mission statement of this group is to:

Take responsibility for providing the leadership, management and oversight of the U.S. government programs which will address the treatment, care and support, and prevention of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia.  We are committed to achieving, in concert with Ethiopian and other partners, within and outside of the government, specific targets which will result in the achievement at a minimum of the five-year goal to provide treatment to 210,000 people; care and support services to 1.05 million people; and prevent 552,000 new infections of HIV/AIDS.  To this end we will operate as a team to develop and implement a unified strategy which utilizes our comparative strengths to make the best use of resources and maximize results for the people of Ethiopia.

Additional agencies that are involved but not represented in Addis Ababa are the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides millions of dollars of  P.L. 480 Title II food aid to Ethiopia each year, which is managed by USAID and partners to complement care programs for OVCs and PLWHA; and the U.S. Department of Labor, which has provided approximately US$1 million to the MOLSA for workplace programs, as part of an International Labor Organization program).
 
The U.S. Peace Corps/Crisis Corps sent an exploratory team to Ethiopia in mid-FY 2004, but was unable to participate in strategy or program formulation due to budgetary restrictions.  It is hoped that Peace Corps will be able to mobilize in future years.
 
The four lead agencies undertook a team building retreat in August 2004 to establish an organizational structure for coordination and decision making at which they established the following structure (ref. Organization Chart on next page):
 
The U.S. Ambassador is the overall leader of the ETAEP group and provides the ultimate decision-making.  All official communications concerning ETAEP are cleared through the Ambassador’s office.  The Ambassador also acts as the point of contact for communications with the highest levels of Ethiopian Government concerning ETAEP activities.
 
The ETEAP council is chaired by the deputy chief of mission (DCM) and comprised of section and agency heads, including the director of USAID, the director of CDC, the DOD security assistance office (SAO) director, and the USAID HIV/AIDS officer.   The council functions as the central point of contact for ETAEP activities.  In its role as advisor to the Ambassador, the council focuses on providing executive summaries on ETAEP activities and seeks the Ambassador’s guidance on issues which cannot be resolved at a lower level.  
 
Specific issues at the strategic level which come from OGAC will be responded to by the DCM (as council chair) with guidance from the other council members as appropriate.  
 
The ETAEP coordinator, who serves as the council secretary, handles communications to and from the council to the collaborative team. The council is also responsible for developing and delivery a coherent message, both for the broader public (in tandem with the Embassy’s Public Affairs Section (PAS)) and for communications with ETAEP partners (although day-to-day partner communications will be handled by the agencies with which the partner is working).
 
The executive council meets monthly at a minimum, and as needed to provide overall policy guidance and decision-making.   
 
The collaborative team is chaired by the ETAEP coordinator.  Collaborative team members include the ETAEP coordinator; a representative from the refugee coordinator’s office; a representative from SAO; a representative from PAS; one or more representatives from CDC; and one or more representatives from USAID.  (The collaborative team membership fluctuates depending on need.)  
  
The collaborative team manages communication with the working groups and serves as a distribution channel for general OGAC communications.   The collaborative team meets weekly and is responsible for operational collaboration for ETAEP design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. 
 
A political/economic officer is currently ETAEP coordinator, and serves as secretary of the council and the collaborative team.  An ETAEP support coordinator position has been established.  
 
Seven topic-specific working groups also have been formed to help implement ETAEP.  Working group chairs are distributed among the ETAEP agencies – USAID chairs prevention and care; CDC chairs treatment and SI; and State chairs management and public diplomacy.  Core membership includes representatives from all four agencies; cooperating agencies and partners are invited to meetings on an as-needed basis.  
 
Four of the working groups  – prevention, care, treatment, and SI – have been key to development of relevant sections of the Five Year Strategy and the 2005 COP.  They have ensured input from implementing partners as necessary to strategy development.  
 
The management working group is an internal group that is working to streamline management and administrative issues associated with the inter-agency ETAEP effort.  Key management and administrative staff from the four agencies participate according to specific agendas.   
 
The public diplomacy working group, chaired by the public affairs officer, focuses on integrated communication messages.  
 
A partnerships working group may be developed, subject to needs articulated by other groups.

The incumbent is designated by the Chief of Mission to serve as operational coordinator for the President’s Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities in Ethiopia, known as Ethiopia’s HIV/AIDS Emergency Plan (ETAEP).

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

'Person', 'domestic', and 'foreign' have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for commercial services, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation includes applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-26 (01/2005).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 451710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology of the Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute has undertaken the experimental evaluation of numerous immunotherapy strategies for neoplastic disease of solid tumors, including recombinant viral-based vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer.   The purpose of this acquisition is to establish and maintain a mouse transgenic breeding colony to be used as a pre-clinical animal model to investigate mechanistic questions in tumor progression and antitumor therapy. We have a unique mouse model termed "MTAG" that develops primary and metastatic mammary cancer (as a consequence of mammary gland specific-transgene expression) in which to study host-tumor interactions.  The nature of tumor development in these mice better mirrors what occurs in human neoplasia.  The overall goals of these studies may thus have important conceptual and practical implications for the immunotherapy of patients with neoplastic disease. The offeror will provide animal care and maintenance for approximately 200 mice (per month) for experimental procedures, and the necessary breeding colonies to produce, replenish and maintain the mouse colony.  Because the female transgenic mouse of interest will be hemizygous, it will also be necessary to screen the offspring via polymerase chain reaction to identify the appropriate transgene-positive mice. The experimental procedures will integrate both cellular and molecular biological techniques to study characteristics of the host-tumor interaction, as well as the design and analysis of immune-based therapeutic approaches to potentially intervene with malignant progression.  The immune studies require dedicated laboratory space to minimize any known contaminants, which may compromise the activity of the immune cells. Therefore, a dedicated mouse facility is required to house and breed these transgenic mice, to provide screening of the offspring and to identify offspring expressing the transgene.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to provide the Line Items below: Line Item 1.  Maintenance of Mouse Breeding Colonies. The Government's requirement is for a minimum of 25 pairs and a maximum of 30 pairs.  Priced by Breeding Pair Cage per Day.

The Contractor shall breed and maintain transgenic mouse colonies in accordance with AAALAC guidelines and DHHS Publication No. NIH 85-23 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  The contractor shall possess an approved Animal Welfare Assurance from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), Office of the Director, NIH, as required by Section 1-43-30 of the Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Contractor shall also ensure that all mice, including transgenic and non-transgenic progeny, are pathogen-free, including but not necessarily limited to:  PVM, REO3, GDVII, POLY, Parvo, MHV, LCM, SEND, ECTRO, and LDH.   If an outbreak is detected, the Contractor shall ensure that no cross-contamination occurs in order to avoid loss of the transgenic colony.  The Contractor shall:  a ) Establish breeding colonies for transgenic mice supplied by the Government. b) Monitor and report on the performance (productivity) of individual breeding pairs, as well as provide an inventory of the transgene-positive and transgene-negative progeny mice, on a monthly basis.  c) Develop and optimize assays to test progeny mice for the presence of the desired transgene, based on the collection of tissues and/or blood samples from wailing mice. d) Remove animals from inventory and assign them to study protocols, as identified by the Project Officer or investigator. e) Ensure about 200 progeny mice are available each month for experimental purposes, as described in Line Item 2. Line Item 2.  Animal Care and Maintenance.  The Government's requirement is for a minimum of 30 cages and a maximum of 50 cages. Priced by Animal Cages per Day (5 Animals per Cage).  Units is 14,600 (365 x 40 cages) x proposed unit price _________ = proposed extended price__________.  The Contractor shall: a) Maintain and expand the breeding colony, as specified in Task 1, in order to produce and deliver approximately 200 progeny per month, including transgenic and non-transgenic mice as requested by the Project Officer for experimental purposes.  b) Ensure that all progeny, including transgenic and non-transgenic progeny, are pathogen-free, as specified in Task 1.  If an outbreak is detected, the Contractor shall ensure that no cross-contamination occurs in uninfected mice in order to avoid loss of the transgenic colony. c) House all mice in microisolator cages, and all cages, feed and water autoclaved prior to use.  This procedure will also be important to minimize spread of any potential infection. The Contractor shall practice the industry standards set forth by AAALAC guidelines and DHHS Publication No. NIH 85-23 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in order to ensure pathogen-free health status.   d) Provide adequate lab space to perform technical manipulations and an adjacent area for NCI investigators to gown and enter the lab space.   e) Provide refrigerator and freezer (-20 degrees C and -70 degrees C) storage of materials and work products. Provide a  BSL I/II hood for use as needed.  LINE ITEM 3. Technical Support.  The Government's requirement is for a minimum of 400 hours and a maximum of 680 hours.   Priced by Technical Support Hour.  Units is 540 hours x proposed unit price_________ = proposed extended price __________. The Contractor shall: a)The Contractor shall inject temperature-sensitive or biologically delicate (labile) materials, as defined by the specified experimental protocol, within 30 minutes of arrival to the Contract facility. The Contractor shall a) Perform experimental procedures as outlined in experimental protocols that will be provided by LTIB investigators.  b) Perform inoculations of tumors, lymphocytes or other reagents and biological materials via diverse routes in mice, including footpad, tail scarification, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous, as requested by the LTIB researcher. Collect blood samples via retro-orbital bleeding, tail vein or cardiac puncture, as defined by the experimental protocol. c) Palpate and measure tumors as requested by LTIB researcher, and contact the Project Officer or investigator if any tumor approaches the ethical limit so that the mouse or mice in question can be arranged for appropriate delivery to the NIH. d) Harvest tissues, such as tumors, spleens, lymph nodes, and supply them either in medium or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  e) Routine viral testing every two months on sentinel animals.  Testing shall include Orphan OPV, MHV, etc., as outlined in Task 1 and directed by AAALAC practices, policies and protocols.  Positive reports shall be transmitted to the Project Officer within 72 hours after the testing has been completed.  LINE ITEM 4.  Delivery Service Priced By Delivery.   The Government's requirement is for a minimum of 40 deliveries and a maximum of 75 deliveries.   Units is 75 deliveries x proposed unit price ________= proposed extended price ________.  The contractor shall pick up and deliver mice, mouse products and reagents between the contractor and Building 10, NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (i)This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this no tice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii)W912L5-05-T-0002 the solicitation is issued as a request for quote.  (iii)The solicitation document and incorporate d provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15 (http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/changes/fac/fac2001-15.htm). (iv)The NAICS is 611420 (Computer Training), this is an unrestricted action, where SBA is concerned.  (v) Line It em 0001 Base year: 14 May 2005 to 30 September 2005 (Phase I). All course development instruction, staff travel, consumable materials, equipment, textbooks and administrative support to complete Phase I of 74B training and education.  Line Item 0002 Option  year 1: 01 October 2005 to 30 July 2006 (Phase II). All course development instruction, staff travel, consumable materials, equipment, textbooks and administrative support to complete Phase II of 74B training and education.  (vi)The Delaware Army National  Guard has a requirement to provide a course that exceeds the standards for the U.S. Army Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 74B, Information Systems Operator-Analyst Course.  The provider of the education/training may use a combination of instructor-le d classes, computer labs and/or computer-based training.  Topics must include computer fundamentals, operating systems, data communications/networking, UNIX system administration, Windows 2000, and TCP/IP.  The creativity of the vendor is called upon, to d eliver the material in the most logical flow-path.  For example, computer fundamentals can be delivered, before more technical information is presented, so all students are considered fundamentally sound.  Further, LANs/WANs, routers, switches and informat ion systems security must be covered.  A CAPSTONE event, which permits the students to demonstrate their proficiency, in a simulated tactical environment, must be included in the second AT period.  Every attempt at adhering to the proposed schedule of date s, should be made, but, based on student feedback, additional dated can be inserted.  The vendor must be open to adding and removing dates, locations and times. Interested parties can email or call CPT Scott A. Soucy, for a copy of the Program of Instructi on (POI) and proposed course dates, which will further assist in the development of the course.   Since the required topics mirror civilian information systems technology, course completion should result in the awarding of no less than 24 semester hours of  college credit, with the potential for the award of a Network Associate Certificate to each participant that completes the program.    Ideally, the vendor will propose a solution that includes a combination of their institutions classroom, computer lab f acilities and those classrooms located at the State Headquarters, Delaware National Guard, One First Regiment Road Wilmington, DE 19808-2191.  The intent is to award a firm fixed price contract with a base year (Phase I) and one option period (Phase II), b ased on the availability of funds.  (viii)The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. (ix)The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose  offer conforms to the solicitation and is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered under authority of FAR clause 52.212-2 Ev aluation Commercial Items. Evaluation will include past performance (developing/providing this type of training to industry and other government agencies), price, semester credit hours awarded, industry accepted certificate(s) awarded, the mix of on-site a nd off-site teaching location(s) and the ability to enter into an agreement (Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)) between Ft.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 		O/a May 1, 2005 through April 30, 2007, with possibility of renewal..
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 		Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

8. POSITION DESCRIPTIONS: 

A.	Background:  

Ethiopia 

Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, with a 2003 population estimated at 70 million people from 83 ethnic groups and languages, living in an area almost twice the size of Texas.  There are nine regions and two special administrative areas: the cities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.  Eighty-five percent of the population lives in rural areas.  Almost 4% of the population lives in Addis Ababa, the capital, and another 11% in other urban regional capitals and trade hubs.  

In the early 1990’s the government of Ethiopia devolved power to ethnically based regions. Decentralization remains an important focus of the government and its donor partners.   Financial and other resource allocations to regions from the federal government are based on formulae that recognize need.  

Religion plays a major part in the lives of most Ethiopians and religious networks reach even the most remote parts of the country, although there is not a strong tradition of religious health care or education networks.  Approximately 45% of the population adheres to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; approximately 45% of the population is Muslim; and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestantism and other religious traditions constitute approximately 10% of the population.   There is a long tradition of religious tolerance and harmony.  

Basic living conditions in terms of health, sanitation and nutrition are extremely poor for the majority of the population.  Maternal mortality rates are 871 per 100,000 live births and under-five mortality rates are 188 per 1000.  Half of Ethiopia’s children are underweight for their age and over half are stunted.  Access to health care is limited to 61.3% for public facilities, with an increase to 70.2% when services provided by private facilities are included.  The primary school gross enrollment rate has increased to 65% (40% girls).  This increase in students has affected the quality of education.  The adult literacy rate is 32.8% (26.4% females; 39.3% males). GDP is under US$100 per capita in the past 10 years, making Ethiopia one of the poorest countries on the continent. 

The political and economic environment is fluid and moving forward, albeit at an uneven pace.   The GOE’s recent achievement of highly indebted poor country completion points has significantly reduced external debt, which bodes well for future economic growth.  Continued progress on food security policies and programs affords cautious optimism about improved impact on poverty reduction.  Progressive implementation of decentralization in different sectors yields a constant ebb and flow of center-periphery tensions that affects all sector programs.   National parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 2005, with local elections scheduled for 2006.

The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Ethiopia

Recognizing the emergency that exists in Ethiopia due to the prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS, the joint partners within the U.S. government—the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Defense, under the auspices of the Department of State—have formed an interagency working group for Ethiopia’s AIDS Emergency Plan (ETAEP).  The mission statement of this group is to:

Take responsibility for providing the leadership, management and oversight of the U.S. government programs which will address the treatment, care and support, and prevention of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia.  We are committed to achieving, in concert with Ethiopian and other partners, within and outside of the government, specific targets which will result in the achievement at a minimum of the five-year goal to provide treatment to 210,000 people; care and support services to 1.05 million people; and prevent 552,000 new infections of HIV/AIDS.  To this end we will operate as a team to develop and implement a unified strategy which utilizes our comparative strengths to make the best use of resources and maximize results for the people of Ethiopia.

Additional agencies that are involved but not represented in Addis Ababa are the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides millions of dollars of  P.L. 480 Title II food aid to Ethiopia each year, which is managed by USAID and partners to complement care programs for OVCs and PLWHA; and the U.S. Department of Labor, which has provided approximately US$1 million to the MOLSA for workplace programs, as part of an International Labor Organization program).
 
The U.S. Peace Corps/Crisis Corps sent an exploratory team to Ethiopia in mid-FY 2004, but was unable to participate in strategy or program formulation due to budgetary restrictions.  It is hoped that Peace Corps will be able to mobilize in future years.
 
The four lead agencies undertook a team building retreat in August 2004 to establish an organizational structure for coordination and decision making at which they established the following structure (ref. Organization Chart on next page):
 
The U.S. Ambassador is the overall leader of the ETAEP group and provides the ultimate decision-making.  All official communications concerning ETAEP are cleared through the Ambassador’s office.  The Ambassador also acts as the point of contact for communications with the highest levels of Ethiopian Government concerning ETAEP activities.
 
The ETEAP council is chaired by the deputy chief of mission (DCM) and comprised of section and agency heads, including the director of USAID, the director of CDC, the DOD security assistance office (SAO) director, and the USAID HIV/AIDS officer.   The council functions as the central point of contact for ETAEP activities.  In its role as advisor to the Ambassador, the council focuses on providing executive summaries on ETAEP activities and seeks the Ambassador’s guidance on issues which cannot be resolved at a lower level.  
 
Specific issues at the strategic level which come from OGAC will be responded to by the DCM (as council chair) with guidance from the other council members as appropriate.  
 
The ETAEP coordinator, who serves as the council secretary, handles communications to and from the council to the collaborative team. The council is also responsible for developing and delivery a coherent message, both for the broader public (in tandem with the Embassy’s Public Affairs Section (PAS)) and for communications with ETAEP partners (although day-to-day partner communications will be handled by the agencies with which the partner is working).
 
The executive council meets monthly at a minimum, and as needed to provide overall policy guidance and decision-making.   
 
The collaborative team is chaired by the ETAEP coordinator.  Collaborative team members include the ETAEP coordinator; a representative from the refugee coordinator’s office; a representative from SAO; a representative from PAS; one or more representatives from CDC; and one or more representatives from USAID.  (The collaborative team membership fluctuates depending on need.)  
  
The collaborative team manages communication with the working groups and serves as a distribution channel for general OGAC communications.   The collaborative team meets weekly and is responsible for operational collaboration for ETAEP design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. 
 
A political/economic officer is currently ETAEP coordinator, and serves as secretary of the council and the collaborative team.  An ETAEP support coordinator position has been established.  
 
Seven topic-specific working groups also have been formed to help implement ETAEP.  Working group chairs are distributed among the ETAEP agencies – USAID chairs prevention and care; CDC chairs treatment and SI; and State chairs management and public diplomacy.  Core membership includes representatives from all four agencies; cooperating agencies and partners are invited to meetings on an as-needed basis.  
 
Four of the working groups  – prevention, care, treatment, and SI – have been key to development of relevant sections of the Five Year Strategy and the 2005 COP.  They have ensured input from implementing partners as necessary to strategy development.  
 
The management working group is an internal group that is working to streamline management and administrative issues associated with the inter-agency ETAEP effort.  Key management and administrative staff from the four agencies participate according to specific agendas.   
 
The public diplomacy working group, chaired by the public affairs officer, focuses on integrated communication messages.  
 
A partnerships working group may be developed, subject to needs articulated by other groups.  
 

B. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION: 

The incumbent is designated by the Chief of Mission to serve as operational coordinator for the President’s Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities in Ethiopia, known as Ethiopia’s HIV/AIDS Emergency Plan (ETAEP).

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to post Contractors questions received for this solicitation and the Governments response.

Question 1: Why would a Masters/MBA or PhD with 20+ years of DOD and formalized Data Analysis expertise without a CDFM, not also qualify?

Answer:   CDFM Certification for the instructor is required.  One of the objectives of the training is to prepare the budget analysts for the CDFM exam.  CDFM certification is assurance the instructor has maintained and enhanced their professional proficiency in Defense financial management.  An instructor with CDFM certification will have the level of expertise to prepare the analysts for the CDFM exam.
 
Question 2.  Why does this a small-business set aside also require CEUs....not many small businesses are qualified to give CEUs.  We are a MAJOR provider of customized training for DOD and civilian federal agencies, to include US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, Pentagon, DLA, DISA, US Army Leadership Academy, etc. We do provide Certificates of Completion, though.  Will that qualify?

Answer:  The contractor will provide a Certification of Completion.  The Government, not the Contractor, will determine the CEUs, Continuing Education Units.
