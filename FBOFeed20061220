<DESC>17.	The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau,  (BBG/IBB) has a requirement for experienced contractors to provide support services for its Office of Security in the areas of radio communications and installation of security systems.  This is a full and open competitive procurement to establish multiple Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts. Due to the nature of this procurement the BBG recognizes that it may be difficult to locate any one firm that may have the required expertise in both technical areas therefore the likelihood of a awarding multiple contracts is possible for the worldwide support of programs assigned to the BBG?s Office of Security.  The BBG/IBB intends to award multiple IDIQ to multiple contractors to secure highly skilled and highly experienced contractors to meet this need. It is anticipated that multiple task orders for these supports services will be awarded on an as required basis during the Base-Year and each of the four (4) Option Years if exercised at the discretion of the BBG subject to the availability of funds. The awarded contracts will include a general scope of work of the BBG radio communications and security systems requirement.  However, each individual Task Order that is awarded will include a more detailed scope of work specific to the identified location where the requirement exist and will be competed among the contractors that are selected for a contract award as a result of this solicitation. The actual work to be performed, the time of such performance and the location of the work shall be determined by the Contracting Officer, who will issue formally executed Task Orders to the Contractor or Contractors that have received a contract award under this solicitation. The only work authorized under the resultant contract(s) is that which is performed after receipt of such Task Orders.  The issuance of individual Task Orders under the resultant contract(s) will be accomplished in the following manner:  (1) BBG will request each Contractor that has received an award to provide both a cost and a technical proposal for the work described in a request for proposal for the individual Task Order within one (1) to three (3) days after receipt of the request.  The request will include the basic site-specific requirements, and a request to provide a firm-fixed price and technical proposal.  (2) The contractor shall submit it?s firm-fixed-price proposal and technical proposal for the individual task order, to the BBG Office of Contracts; (3) The BBG will separately but concurrently evaluate the proposals, and (4) The BBG Office of Contracts will issue a finalized Task Order to the Contractor that has been determined to offer the Best Value to the Government based on the technical merit, price and other factors stated in the contract and any additional factors included in the request for proposal for the specified task order; (5) After receipt of the finalized Task Order the selected Contractor will proceed with the work specified in the Task Order.  Contractors NOT receiving an award under this Task Order remain eligible to compete for any subsequent BBG security installation requirement during the life of the contract.  It is anticipated that the Request For Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about January 31, 2007.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the above numbered RFP must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer at the above address or via email to kharper@ibb.gov or facsimile at 202-260-0855.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the Agency.  This notice is not a RFP, IFB or RFQ.

Specifically, the original specification included a requirement for dewatering, however, the requirement was not well defined because the FAA was awaiting the results of an environmental report regarding the dewatering.  The report has now been completed, so a well defined specification can now be included in the Contract. The dollar value of this modification has the potential to exceed $100,000.00. This effort is unavailable for competition.

<DESC>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   The GSA is seeking a contractor to perform as CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) for the Edith Green Wendell Wyatt Federal Building Modernization Project at 1220 SW Third Avenue, Portland, OR.  This project is a building upgrade and will include ADA restrooms, seismic, electrical, HVAC distribution, complete building re-cladding, secure entry, blast and seismic resistance, lower level exit, 1st Impressions, tenant space, finishes, HVAC replacement, and security system equipment.  The goal is to achieve Silver LEED Certification.  Work involves renovation of about 500,000 gsf of space.  The building will remain occupied throughout the project, with work meticulously phased around 25 tenant agencies that will need to be moved to swing space and back to their final space in the building.  

PROJECT MAGNITUDE:  The Estimated Cost of Construction is between $80,000,000.00 and $85,000,000.00.

PROJECT DURATION:  We anticipate a Design Phase start in Spring of 2007, a Construction Phase start of March 2008, and a targeted project completion of August 2012.

EARLY EXCHANGES:  Being conducted with interested parties that responded to previously posted Sources Sought Notice.  Summary of Early Exchanges will be posted with data current as of January 5, 2007.  To access documents issued during Early Exchanges, search FBO for Reference Number "GS10P07-EGWW".

COMPETITION:  Unrestricted.

CONTRACTING METHOD:  Best Value Source Selection, Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Contract Type with Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Delivery Method with potential Award Fee.  The scope of CMc services is to include Design Phase Services (constructability reviews, value engineering, project schedule and construction cost development, etc.) and Construction Phase Services (construction contract and subcontract administration, CPM scheduling, monitoring of construction costs, etc.).  For this contract, technical factors will be given greater weight than price (Design Phase Services and the GMP Proposal) in the selection of a successful offeror.
 
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:   Proposals will be evaluated in two Phases.  In Phase 1, offerors will be evaluated on technical factors including qualifications, past performance, and key personnel.  Phase 2 offerors will be evaluated on submission of their GMP Proposal consisting of a conceptual estimate and pricing for Design Phase Services, and any other requirements stated in detail in the RFP. 

CONTRACT AWARD: A guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Design Phase services.  The price for Construction Phase services will be negotiated at a later date, resulting in a fixed price contract. 

SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: Draft being posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) December 20, 2006.  Official RFP expected January 5, 2007.

PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE:  A pre-proposal conference is expected to occur on or about January 18, 2007, but will be confirmed via posting in FBO at a later date.  At that time, please notify the POC via e-mail of the name and contact information of each person planning to attend.

CLOSING DATE:  Phase 1 Technical submittals are tentatively projected for receipt no later than 2:00 PM PST on February 6, 2007, but refer to finalized RFP posting for exact date and time.

<DESC>The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking to establish a new contract with an organization highly-experienced in providing technical support services for both methodologic and substantive research projects in the nutritional epidemiology of cancer.  The objective of this proposed contract is to provide scientific services in support of this research program.  The two areas of emphasis in which the NEB scientists are proposing this Support Services Contract (SSC) will support are Methodologic Research in Nutritional Assessment; and Prospective Studies.  Under these two main areas of emphasis, the SSC will serve the following purposes: (1) Support of ongoing epidemiologic studies; (2) Support of a new large-scale feasibility study; (3) rapid implementation of support for pilot substudies necessary in the planning of new Branch research initiatives; (4) development of new dietary assessment tools; (5) Creation of new nutritional composition data bases; (6) Support of biomarker development for improving and evaluating self-report dietary assessment instruments; (7) Rapid and cost-effective identification of and subcontracting with experts in nutritional biomarker analysis; and (8) Facilitation of international agreements and contractual arrangements.  The scientific design and oversight of the research projects are the responsibility of the NEB.  Support services provided by the contract include the following activities: developing liaisons with local and international organizations and individuals whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of the studies; design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures, and other documents); hiring, training, and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); identifying study subjects; supervising and managing field operations; collecting required data; entering and tracking data for biologic specimens; data processing activities (e.g., coding, keying, and editing); and maintaining quality control and standardization for producing appropriate and valid data.  

It is anticipated that an incrementally-funded, cost-reimbursement, term type (level of effort) contract will be awarded for a five-year period of performance.  The estimated level of effort for this contract is 35,000 hours.  The anticipated date of release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is 15 days from the posting of this announcement.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days following release of the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the National Cancer Institute.  Award of this project is anticipated by May 30, 2007.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates interceptor aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders.  CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of upgrading the avionics and mission systems, initially on its 10 Citation II Lot III jets and potentially the remaining 16 Citation II jets.  The intent of the upgrade is to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as lower life cycle support costs.  To reduce program costs and enhance equipment availability and support, the avionics and sensor systems should incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" non-developmental item equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Those systems must be cost effective to operate and fully supportable (parts, technical assistance, etc.) for 20 years beyond the date of acquisition.  They should also be currently in production, operationally viable (demonstrable) and capable of being easily retrofitted with updated configurations. 



2.0	REQUEST

CBP is seeking information on prime contractors who can install and integrate commercially available avionics and sensor systems, including electronic flight instrument displays that are night vision goggle compatible and reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) compliant.  The sensor suite will include multi-mode radar and electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  System performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements and life cycle support will be important considerations for this modernization effort.  The Maximum combined weight for the complete integrated Radar and EO/IR system shall not exceed 370 pounds.  Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their avionics and sensor systems as an integrated end product.  



MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (GENERAL):



2.1	Radar System

AN/APG-66 radar, which are currently installed in the modified noses of CBP Citation Interceptor jets, are integrated with EO/IR sensors and capable of slewing EO/IR tracked targets.  Replacement radar should have comparable system performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements as that radar.  At a minimum, the radar should provide 120-degree azimuth and elevation coverage with an automatic capability to detect and track air and surface targets.  Radar capabilities should include the following:

	Air-to-air radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size aircraft;
	Air-to-ground radar detection, tracking and sorting of moving vehicles;
	Air-to-sea radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size vessels;
	Air-to-ground high-resolution radar imaging;
       Radar Slave to EO/IR Functionality;
	10 target (minimum) Track While Scan mode; and
	2 target (minimum) Situation Awareness Mode (SAM)

The radar system should include a Built-in-Test (BIT) mode to accomplish failure detection and failure isolation to a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without the assistance of radar support equipment at the organization level.  In addition, the BIT mode shall provide the aircrew, via the onboard radar display, and ground maintenance personnel, via a ground accessible display, the capability to determine radar operational readiness.    



2.2	Electro-optical/Infrared Sensor

The EO/IR sensor shall be housed in a 360-degree continuous rotation turret that is capable of performing long-range visual search, surveillance, and tracking from an airborne platform.  It should be capable of performing those functions in the visible light spectrum as well as the mid-wave infrared spectrum.  The EO/IR sensor shall be interfaced with the radar, capable of slaving to tracked radar targets, and providing automatic focus and video tracking in all electro-optical and infrared modes with operator selectable optical focal lengths.  Additional functionality shall include an eye-safe laser range finder for determining the range to a target of interest and a high-power laser pointer for illuminating a target of interest with night vision goggle compatible light.  The EO/IR sensor payload should include:

	A color TV camera;
	A color TV Spotter Scope; 
	An infrared thermal imager with a minimum of three distinct fields of view;
	An infrared laser range finder that is bore sighted with the sensors;
	A laser illuminator (infrared or near infrared desired); and
	EO/IR Slave to Radar Functionality


2.3	Mission Systems Operator Sensor Station

The Mission Systems Operator station should provide mission operators with the ability to control and simultaneously display and record radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor videos.  System architecture should include displays at the operator station and the cockpit.  Displays shall have the capability to display mapping, navigation and target information.  To allow maximum flexibility, displays should be capable of simultaneous cockpit and sensor station presentations of various airborne and maritime formats. 



2.4	FAA Certification

A Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the FAA is required for all installations, modifications and structural changes affecting the FAA certification of the Citation.  The radar shall radiate in a Federal Government allocated frequency band under the administration of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration



                                 





 3.0	RESPONSES

This request for information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government to issue a Request for Proposal or award a contract.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE MODIFICATION IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO ALL INTERESTED RESPONDENTS.  THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED STUAS/TIER II SOURCES SOUGHT NOTIFICATION AND MODIFICATIONS REMAIN UN EFFECT.  ***THESE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ONLY.***

1Q: Para 2h references "plug & play modularity;" does that refer to just the payload or for all LRUs? 
1A: The term Plug and Play refers to the payload. Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) will be replaced as they typically are (i.e., changed out with like items).

2Q: What is "NAVAIR TCDL Interoperability Profile, Version 11?"  
2A: The NAVAIR TCDL Interoperability Profile, Version II, will be replaced by the Joint Interoperability Profile in early 2007.  The draft of this document is being made available to RFI responders.

3Q: Is there a specific system in mind with respect to "Day visible/night IR Anti-collision light?" (i.e., attached to the aircraft)
3A: No.

4Q: What are the acoustic levels (quantified if possible) associated with "Undetectable by human hearing at operational altitude of 1000 to 3000 ft AGL?"  
4A: Acoustic levels will be addressed in the Request for Proposal (RFP).

5Q: What fidelity of "estimated costs" is necessary?  That is, do you want system ROM as a total or by aircraft or by component? 
5A: The Government is interested in all available estimates but estimated cost by component is ideal. 
 
6Q: Can we assume minimum production of 40 UAS (120 air vehicles) spread over FY08-FY12 with IOC in FY10?
6A:  No additional information (other than that provided in the RFI) is available at this time.

7Q: What are the current and/or future comms devices (e.g., Singcar) to relay to/from?  
7A:  Currently, Single Channel Ground-to-Air Radio (SINCGAR) and Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS). Future devices are expected to include Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), voice, data and video, but not Satellite Communications (SATCOM).

8Q: Is there an MOS for current UAV operators? 
8A:  The USMC has identified a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) for an existing UAV platform but a specific MOS has not yet been identified for the STUAS/Tier II UAS.

9Q: In the portion dealing with specific information the Navy would like to have addressed (number (3)) "Availability of Communications Relay" does the Navy consider this a separate communications relay payload or is the Navy seeking "combinations relay" as an integral part of the basic air vehicles capabilities?
9A:  Communications relay can be a separate payload or an integral part of the basic air vehicle capability for Increment 0.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES TO THIS RFI ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.

Modification to Contract W912HN-05-C-0062.  The Contractor shall furnish all tools, labor, equipment, materials and incidentals in connection with the phased hazardous materials abatement and demolition of four WWII-era buildings as identified on the drawi ngs and specifications.  Work includes complete demolition and removal of buildings and foundations and select demolition of supporting pavement, site improvements, underground water and sewer utility lines, electrical and gas utilities servicing the exist ing building, and incidental related work, complete.  Hazardous materials to be abated include (but are not limited to) asbestos, fluorescent lights and ballasts, lead, thermostats, smoke detectors, CO2 detectors, fire extinguishers, and compressed refrige rant gases. This contract action is for construction for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or to submit  proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after the date of publication of the initial synopsis will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the Notice of Intent will normally be considered solely f or the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No contract award will be made on the basis of any response to this notice because the Synopsis of Intent shall not be considered a solicitation document. The proposed work is completely within the project limits of an existing, active $25M construction contract previously awarded and will be required to be laid out (including regulatorily-required work plans), approved, completed, inspected, and turned over  in less than 50 days so that the existing Contractor is not delayed in completing required, phased, follow-on work which is already a part of its contract.   The estimated range of cost for this work is between $250,000 and $500,000.

<DESC>The United States General Services Administration (GSA), Northern California Area Team (NCAT), 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102-3661 intends to issue a sole source task order modification for task order GST0906BH0258 issued to Trofholz Technologies (TTI), 2207 Plaza Drive, Suite 100, Rocklin, California, 95765. Authority: FSS, Schedule 70, pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies. This task order modification shall be issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 43 and the ordering guidance found at FAR 8.405-2, Ordering Procedures for Services Requiring a Statement of Work and under the specific authority of 8.405-6(b)(4), Sole Sources Justification and Approval, due to an urgent and compelling need that exists and following the normal ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. In July 2006, TTI was awarded GSA task order GST0906BH0258 - a competitively solicited, evaluated and awarded a Task Order based on the terms, conditions and ordering procedures of Federal Supply Schedule, GS-35F-0447N. This task order was awarded with a three (3) month base period of performance to support the California National Guard (CNG), located in Sacramento, California and GSA was informed that the CNG would procure any future requirements for this service through another contracting agency. The CNG was unable to award a follow-on contract for this requirement by the original end date of the contractor?s period of performance and the task order was modified in November 2006 to extend the period of performance through December 30, 2006. This extenuation included a two (2) month optional period of performance, which would allow performance through February 28, 2007 if required due to re-procurement issues. This notice is submitted as public notice that GSA intends to extend the period of performance of task order GST0906BH0258 through February 28, 2007 at a total cost of $31,148.80. Awarding this short term contract modification will provide the CNG a solution to meet their immediate program needs and allow the other contracting agency the additional needed re-procurement time to complete their procurement. TTI as the current contract holder is the only known and qualified source, which can provide the required services to the Government in accordance with the current need. See Numbered Note 22. This notice is not a request for proposals and a solicitation document for this service does not exist. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the work required by this effort in writing to andrea.brown@gsa.gov no later than 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on December 30, 2006. All responses received by December 30, 2006 will be considered in the Government's determination to continue this solicitation and subsequent award on a sole source basis or seek additional competition. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The anticipated date of award is December 31, 2006.

<DESC>This is a market survey.  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($6 million) which have the capability to continue and expand the impact of the Evidence-based Practice Centers Program - a flagship program in AHRQ focusing on research with systematic review methodology and critical appraisal of scientific literature. The EPCs will provide a variety of services and products, including the development of evidence reports, comparative effectiveness reviews, and technology assessments. These are systematic reviews based on rigorous, comprehensive syntheses and analyses of relevant scientific literature, emphasizing explicitly detailed documentation of methods rationale and assumptions. Multiple task order driven contracts are anticipated. Task orders may address a variety of assignments and may include brief as well as comprehensive systematic review or methodologic projects, depending on the current needs of the program. The assignments will likely have tight and/or overlapping deadlines by which specific products will be required, and duration of individual Task Orders may vary. EPCs also will be expected to have the methodological competence and management flexibility to satisfy a range of solo and multiple tasks that need to be performed concurrently. Topics of task orders are expected to cover all health care clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic areas of focus. Clinical areas may focus on traditional therapeutics as well as complementary, alternative, nutritional, and other emerging areas such as genomics. Topics may also include a focus on implementation, delivery and systems of care, effectiveness and efficiency of health care and the group or organizational unit of analysis. EPCs will a.) conduct rigorous systematic reviews of relevant scientific literature. Systematic reviews will implement methods for general evidence reports, effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, comparative reviews, systematic review updates and other substantive reports of evidence to be developed during the course of the contract; b.) Synthesize results of systematic reviews and report the findings with high transparency; i.e., explicitly detailed methods, rationales, and assumptions in a format(s) appropriate to the topic and intended audience; c.) Advance the methodology of systematic review in organized projects which include detailed and descriptive reports; d.) Collaborate with partners, including other EPCs and AHRQ programs, to promote relevant, consistent, transparent and valuable implementation of the systematic review process, dissemination of findings from systematic reviews and methodology projects, and the EPC Program as a whole. In addition, an EPC may be assigned related tasks such as a.) Perform special analyses, such as meta-analyses, cost effectiveness analyses, decision analyses, individual patient-level data analysis; e) Collaborate with public and private partners in specific educational or training projects; for example, developing evidence-based curricula, providing training opportunities in systematic reviews, or in conducting educational sessions on interpretation and understanding of research studies; f.) Collaborate with other programs within AHRQ and the Federal government, where a systematic review may be supportive of that program mission; g.) Provide technical assistance to organizations that seek to use EPC reports as a basis for decision-making; for example, developing consensus statements, producing tools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of patient care, etc.; and/or h.) Contribute to efforts to develop relevant topics for systematic review; for example, scan published and grey literature; interact with partners regarding practices needing a summary of the evidence-base, etc. The EPCs are to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals in fields such as medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, epidemiology, statistics and data analysis, health services research, behavioral research, public health, social sciences, library science, and science writing and editing. Key personnel who are constant across EPC projects should include an EPC Director, EPC Associate Director and/or Project Manager, and Investigators, who will apply their scientific and content expertise in conducting systematic review methodology and managing the progress of systematic reviews. In addition, it is expected that there will be ready access to expert individuals who can serve in Librarian, Statistician/Data analyst, and Editor roles. Interested small businesses capable of performing the above with the requisite qualifications and expertise, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirements as described above no later than January 4, 2007.  No solicitation document is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov or paper copies (original and two copies) to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements received after January 4, 2007, will not be reviewed.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a small business set-aside or a full and open competitive procurement.

Who we are:AmeriCorps*VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America)
AmeriCorps VISTA was created in 1964 for the purpose of strengthening and supplementing efforts to eliminate poverty in the U.S.  VISTA provides full-time volunteers (members), as a resource, to nonprofit community organizations and public agencies to create and expand programs that ultimately bring low-income individuals and communities out of poverty.  The VISTA member is a resource whose role is to generate the commitment of private sector resources, encourage volunteer service at the local level and to build the capacity of local agencies and organizations to build sustainable anti-poverty programs. VISTA members spend one year in full-time service on a project that addresses the needs of low-income communities.  VISTA is administered by The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation), a Federal Government agency. Annually, approximately 6,000 individuals serve as VISTA members, and over 160,000 have served since 1964.  The VISTA program, headquartered in Washington DC, is managed locally through Corporation State Offices.  The State Offices accept applications from local organizations and agencies who are interested in using the VISTA resource to develop or expand their anti-poverty program.  Corporation program staff members sign Memoranda of Agreement with organizations that demonstrate a solid plan for using the VISTA resource to build organizational capacity and develop a program that is sustainable.  The typical length of a VISTA project is 3 to 5 years. 

Project Sponsoring Organizations (Sponsors)
Sponsors are the community based organizations and public agencies that apply to the Corporation for VISTA members to serve at their project.  Sponsors direct the project, supervise the VISTA member, and provide the necessary administrative support to complete the goals and objectives of the project.  

Potential Services Sought:The Domestic Volunteer Service Act (DVSA) outlines the objectives of VISTA as:1.to generate the commitment of private sector resources;2.to encourage volunteer service at the local level, and 3.to strengthen local agencies and organizations.  All of the above objectives are in support of strengthening and supplementing efforts to eliminate and alleviate poverty and poverty-related problems in the US. Currently, VISTA is able to evaluate and measure the first two objectives. 

Our Sources sought notice relates to the third objective, and how we can envoke capacity building.  We are looking for a company who can establish a method of measuring and evaluating this objective. VISTA  is interested in exploring evaluating and measuring capacity building.  VISTA is committed to initiating an external evaluation to assess the programs performance in building the capacity of local organizations to carry out sustainable anti-poverty programs.  Furthermore, the 2006 Performance Rating Assessment Tool (PART) called for VISTA to look at how it currently measures and evaluates the programs objectives.Proposed Processes Needed for Capacity Building Study:
1.Coordinate with the Corporation and AmeriCorps*VISTA; 2.Develop Evaluation Plan; 3.Design and Pretest Data Collection Instruments for Study Participants; 4.Obtain OMB Clearances; 5.Locate and Track Study Participants; 6.Conduct data collection for Study Participants;7.Analyze Data and Report Results; 8.Create Data Files for Further research;9.Create An Evaluation and Measurement Tool for further usage.  

Study Goals:The primary goal of this project is to design a measurement tool to assess VISTAs performance in supporting and strengthening local organizations and agencies in their fight against poverty. We want this project to answer the question:Is VISTA supporting and strengthening local organizations and agencies in alleviating poverty? If yes, how?. We are also seeking to determine capacity indicators that we can link to overall performance as a continuous measurement.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA LIVING WITH A STAR SPACE ENVIRONMENT TESTBEDS REQUIREMENTS WORKSHOP
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Office of Space Science is sponsoring a workshop to seek requirements for investigation providers and partners from all industry, government agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and universities for its next data mining opportunity in the Space Environment Testbeds (SET) project in the Living With A Star (LWS) Program.  The SET investigations of interest will use existing in-space flight data to develop or improve design and/or operations models, guidelines, and databases applicable to accommodation or mitigation of solar-varying space environment effects.  Requirements for investigation should (1) better characterize the environment in the presence of a spacecraft or aircraft and/or (2) perform better predictions of hardwares performance in the space environment.  Five focus technology categories have the highest priority: (1) the environment in the presence of the spacecraft; (2) effects on microelectronics technologies; (3) effects on detector and/or sensor technologies; (4) degradation and shielding properties of materials; and (5) spacecraft charging/discharging. This workshop will take place on March 29 and 30, 2007 at the Marriott Greenbelt, Greenbelt, MD.	Registration, accommodation information, and agenda can be found under the LWS SET website, http://lws-set.gsfc.nasa.gov	 .  Individuals and/or corporations planning to attend are requested to pre-register by March 21, 2007, by completing the electronic registration form provided under the LWS SET website. Workshop products are intended to refine the technical requirements for LWS SET investigations.  The refined requirements will be used as advice when NASA evaluates proposals submitted to the SET program element described in Appendix B.6 of the NASA Research Announcement NNH07ZDA001N, Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 2007, that is planned for release about February 16, 2007.  Specific information describing requirements used in the last LWS SET NRA is posted on the LWS SET web site.  In this workshop, we will also discuss opportunities for cost-sharing of SET investigations. Workshop attendees are requested to provide the following information at the workshop:  a.	A description of the preliminary requirements for an investigation; b.	A description of how their suggested investigations can address the preliminary requirements; c.	An estimate of the cost and schedule for providing the investigation products; and, d.	An identification of approaches for cost-sharing the investigation. A form requesting this information will be located at the LWS SET web site. Questions concerning the workshop should be directed to Chikia S. Barnes at the LWS SET Office, (301) 286-3916 or via e-mail: Chikia.S.Barnes@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>B -- Marshfield MMR2 Study
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to Marshfield Clinic, 1000 N. Oak Ave., Marshfield, WI 54449-5703.   The Measles-Mumps-Rubela (MMR2) project is a twelve-year study which seeks to determine the long-term persistence of immunity in children after vaccination with a second dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR2).  In 1993, after a competitive bidding process, CDC entered into a contract with Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, a research group affiliated with a large health maintenance organization service central Wisconsin.  Under the terms of the contract, Marshfield enrolled 300 kindergarten-aged children from among the patients of the HMO, administered MMR2 vaccine, and began drawing sera from them periodically (1 month, 6 months, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, and 12 years post-vaccination) so that long-term immunity could be tested.  Marshfield is currently obtaining the 10th year post-vaccination serum draw.  The extension of the contract would complete the study by funding Marshfield to acquire the final serum draw from the study subjects 12 years post-vaccination.  No other contractor would be able to locate the study subjects and obtain serum from them under the circumstances of the study.    A contract shall be issued to Marshfield Clinic.  Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that Marshfield Clinic is the only organization that can provide the study subjects and obtain serum from them under the circumstances of the study to meet all of the program requirements including cost and time constraints.   Note 22 applies herein.  The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1):  FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Contract to SAIC under Future Force Warrior Advanced Technology Demonstration Program
<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Englewood, CO, to perform systems engineering, software development, software integration, and support for the c ompletion of the final year of the Future Force Warrior (FFW) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program.  Under the proposed contract, SAIC will work under FFW Technology Program Office (TPO) guidance to refine the existing FFW Information Management  and Networking (IMN) application developed during Increment 1 of the ATD Program. The rationale for other than full and open competition is that given the mid-program status and time-critical nature of the FFW ATD Program, SAIC has been determined to be t he only contractor currently capable of working with the FFW TPO to design and integrate the soldier-centric IMN system in the specified timeframe of six months with technical support continuing an additional six months. SAIC developed the original IMN app lication for the FFW ATD, have successfully designed soldier-centric systems for the FFW program since the earliest phases of the program and are FFWs subject matter expert in IMN.  The time required to bring any other design team up to speed and provide the necessary detailed knowledge required to perform the required work would cause an approximate eight month delay and would cause the FFW ATD Program to incur considerable monetary costs.  Once the design solutions developed under this effort mature, it is anticipated that system components will be procured under full and open competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all comments received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the pur pose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please refer to numbered note 25.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  Any inquiries about this announcement should be directed to Mr. David Mark via e-mail at david.w.mark@natick.army.mil or by facsimile, 508-233-5286.

This solution concept call is part of a planning activity and is intended to support the AF CY07 Space & C4ISR Capability Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) process, the AF C2ISR Flight Plan, and development of the FY10 AF POM. Potential solution concept submitters will be provided access to the FY10 C2 Needs and administrative instructions for concept submission.  This solution concept call is open to DoD contractors and US government agencies.  Requests for this information access should be made by e-mail to ken.kronlund.ctr@hanscom.af.mil (tel. 781-377-5544) and william.gottlieb@hanscom.af.mil (tel. 781-377-8752).

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Resource Management, Office of the Executive Director, Information Technology Unit (RM/EV/IT).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Office WriterEE Software and 12-month Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.RM/EV/IT has identified the Office WriterEE Software is a sub-component of a greater system called MSP/BSP.  The MSP/BSP is a system that among other things provide the ability for the State Department to comply with mandatory annual Congressional reporting requirements.  The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253©(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source is available and no other business software can provide adequate support for DoSs MSP/MBP system.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the software identified by brand name herein has been determined to be the only software that meets the Departments requirements as a key sub-component of the Departments MSP/MBP system.  The reports to Congress have very particular formatting requirements.  These formatting requirements can be accomplished through time intensive manual methods, which Microsoft does not support but the Office Writer application is specifically designed and supported to automate these functions.  Another function performed by the application is complex merges of data from different sources in unique (variable) ways.The developers that provide the MSP/MBP system have made Office Writer a requirement for their product.  A further consideration is that the delivery dates for the congressional report are firm.  The impact for not meeting these deadlines would be significant and severe.<BR><BR>

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Sole Source Justification
For Think and Do Software for the DPGS RTCI System

Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.  As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:

(1).  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific      identification of the document as a ?Justification for other than full and open competition.?

Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN).

(2).  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Purchase of 15 Licenses from Automation Direct for usage of Think and Do Software version 5.5 at the DGPS V3 sites incorporating the Remote Transmitter Control Interface Change (RTCI).

(3).  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs (including the estimated value).

The RTCI Software version 1.0.0 was developed internally using the Think and Do Software, version 5.5.  The software is designed to provide remote user (NAVCEN Operators) interface with the MSK-5SS Transmitters located at the 19 DGPS V3 Sites throughout the country.  It took a year-and-a-half of several man-hours to develop and test this software. In addition to this development and testing, the software was installed on development equipment and three DGPS sites at Greensboro, N.C.; Macon, Ga.; and Billings, Mt.  To use alternate software, at this phase of the project, would incur significant additional man-hour costs to the project.  New software would require redevelopment, testing, and re-installation of the change into the field.  These additional efforts would double the cost to the project, with no significant savings or improvements in the systems performance realized.

Four Licenses have already been purchased.  The cost to purchase the remaining 15 Licenses required for all of the remaining DGPS V3 Sites is $28,425.00

(4)  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other that full and open competition.

6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
(a) Authority.
2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in? 
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or 
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) 

 (5).  A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

It took a several people a year-and-a-half to develop, test, and field the existing software.  All of this effort would be wasted by using alternate software.  The existing RTCI Software, version 1.0.0, was developed using the Think and Do, version 5.5 Software.  This software is peculiar to Automation Direct and using similar software would not work with the RTCI Software developed for the government.  Additional development, testing, and replacement of existing Software in the field would have to be accomplished.  This effort would double the cost of the project and would delay it by another year.

(6).  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and , if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

Market research has not provided any vendors that produce this software other than Automation Direct.  Other Software tested did not produce the satisfactory results. 

(7).  A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

Preliminary Licenses for the Think and Do Software, version 5.5, was purchased in May 2002.  The costs for these Licenses are the same now as they were during the time of the initial purchase.

(8).  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

No, results from internet searches have not provided any other vendors or distributors that produce or resale this software.  It is proprietary to Automation Direct.  

(9).  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:

(i).  Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  

Not applicable.

(ii).  When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.

This would double the cost of the project and delay the field deployment by 1 year. 

(iii).  When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.

Same as above.

(10).  A listing of the sources , if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None.

(11).  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Will reevaluate the software at the end of it?s life cycle.

Guidelines are in the form of federal specifications, customer's requirements and Navy specifications and requirements.  Incumbent must evaluate and follow these guidelines using judgment to make adjustments as necessitated by variance in materials or production methods.  Independent judgment is often exercised under the general supervision of supervisor.

Must be able to participate in unarmed self-defense training.  Must maintain CPR certification.  

6.  WORKING CONDITIONS

The work is in a sign shop setting located in an industrial shop area.  The work area is properly heated, lighted, and ventilated and the employee must observe normal safety, personal and institutional security precautions while working.  Work and training areas and classrooms used by incumbent are behind the brig security wall.  Close contact with prisoners is required on a daily basis and direct supervision of prisoners is also required.  Due to potential aspects of security, must become trained and prepared for unarmed self-defense.  Could be subject to being held hostage.  Frequent visits to industrial, construction, warehouse and/or testing sites may require the use of protective glasses, headgear, hearing devices, and protective clothing.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: 

The BEP Product Development Center developed an upgraded replacement for the transmissive inspection system (TIS). This system inspects the watermark and security thread on the office currency inspection system (OCIS). The current TIS component group is comprised of Cognex brand hardware and software utilizing Cognex?s 1992 technology. Through market research PDC researched and tested commercially available state of the art machine vision components and determined that the Cognex 5400 series is the only commercially available system that will meet the BEP?s minimum requirements based on market system that will meet the BEP?s minimum requirements based on market research. Specifically, the Cognex 5400 series is the only brand that offers geometric pattern matching capability requirement for accurate inspection of banknotes. Cognex?s system uses geographic information instead of pixel grid based correlation which is used by other manufacturers and does not provide the accuracy required for banknote inspection. The Cognex 5400 series tolerates wide changes in object angle, size and appearance and offers ten times greater accuracy over other pattern matching techniques. Due to the inherent inconsistencies and deviations associated with the manufacture of watermark shapes, the positioning provided by the ?PATMAX?? feature of the Cognex 5400series will minimize the amount of ?false alarm? spoilage due to improper identification of imbedded security features. The PATMAX? feature is proprietary to Cognex and can only be obtained from Cognex or through one of the Cognex?s authorized partners. 

In addition, the Cognex 5400 series also provides the following benefits: 

A) Cognex offeres the best in class Search and Pattern tool with the patented PATMAX algorithm. This machine vision sotware tool is extremely robust and tolerant of variations that occur with watermark formation with regard to density and registration variations.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IS AMENDED TO DELETE THE SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  THE CLOSING DATE IS REVISED TO 4:00 P.M. DECEMBER 22, 2006.  



THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS  NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is EA1330-07-RQ-0074.  The U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Mission Support Division, Norfolk, Virginia has a requirement to purchase the following equipment:  (1)  25,854 ft. of  Electromechanical Cable in accordance with the following specifications:  

NOAA Electromechanical Cable Requirements


Introduction:

The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations Center, Atlantic and Pacific, uses electromechanical cable to lower various scientific instruments over the side of their oceangoing research vessels.  The cables support the instruments and provide the means for electrical signals to pass between the instruments and the vessel.  It is typically called "CTD wire".

The following specifications describe in general terms the significant characteristics the cable design must have.  No priority is implied by the order given.

General:

An electromechanical cable is required to lower various scientific instruments over the side of an oceangoing research vessel.  The cable shall be capable of safely lowering an instrument to 6,000?m water depth in the dynamic environment caused by ship and wave motion, and lowering/raising speeds of 70 m/min.  Multiple conductors are required for the real time transmission of electrical data and control signals and for redundancy.  The cable shall be capable of being stored under tension for long periods of time on single drum winches to multiple layers.  Resistance to crushing is desirable.  It is expected that payloads will frequently produce loading of the cable (both static + dynamic) approaching 50% of rated breaking strength (RBS).

The cable will be used with LEBUS grooved drum shell.  The cable must be compatible with existing LEBUS grooved shells for a Markey DESH-5, 38" width drum.  As listed below:

Winch 
(Manufacturer)	Model No.	Drum Width	Pitch	Number of 
Grooves
Markey	DESH-5	38?	0.329004	115.5
		38?	0.3	116.5
		38?	0.323404	117.5
		38?	0.3	118.5
		24?		
		24?		
	DESH-3	24?		73.5
		24?		74
	COM-7			
	DUSH-3			

After manufacture of the cable, a piece, approximately 30 meters in length will be sent by the manufacturer to Markey for determination of what Lebus will be necessary for the cable to be used on the Markey winches above.  The report from Markey detailing the recommended Lebus for the Markey winches showing the airgap for various pitch Lebuses and the loading/stretch data used to determine the airgap will be provided to the purchaser before the cable is shipped.  This report shall no more than $500 to the price of the cable.

Characteristics:

1)	Maximum strength attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of strength to weight.  The ability of a cable to "survive" under extreme conditions is a function of its Rated or Ultimate Breaking Strain.

2)	Highest elastic limit attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of elastic limit to weight.  This characteristic controls the mix of payload size, wire out, wire speed and environmental conditions at which the cable can operate with safety.  This applies to both strength and electrical components of the cable.

3)	High rotational stability -- identified as a minimal amount of axial rotation under loads cyclically varying from 0% to 45% of RBS.  Low rotation is considered necessary to avoid looping/hockling the cable on bottom contact or "Zero" tension conditions and to prevent excessive spinning of lowered instruments.  (A 'trade off' with item 15)

4)	High degree of armor stress balance -- identified as the absence or near absence of variations to the relative loading on inner and outer armors that produce strength degradation when one end of the cable is free to rotate.

5)	Minimum service life of 5 years -- the useful life in "normal" service assuming reasonable care and proper handling.

6)	Cable shall be capable of operating at:

>30% RBS for 90% of expected life.
>40% RBS for 70% of expected life.

7)	The cable shall be able to withstand occasional loading to 50% RBS without significant reduction in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

8)	The armor shall be galvanized.

9)	The cable shall have a finished O.D. of 8.1788 mm (0.322").

10)	The cable shall be in  two  unbroken lengths of 7,800 m (without splices).

11)	The cable shall be capable of operation with single drum winch systems where the cable is stored under tension.

12)	The cable shall be able to operate continuously (useful life) over sheaves not less than (NLT) 40 times the cable diameter without degradation in strength.

13)	The cable must be capable of withstanding repeated flexures over sheaves at the nominal working loads given in item 6 without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

14)	The cable shall be capable of withstanding cyclical loading in tension as results from ship motion without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

15)	The cable shall exhibit the best possible resistance to abrasion, both internal and external, consistent with the need for high rotational stability.  (A 'trade off' with Item 3)

16)	The cable shall exhibit the best possible resistance to corrosion, particularly crevice corrosion and hydrogen imbrittlement.

17)	The cable shall not unlay when cut, i.e. it must be well preformed.

18)	The cable shall be lubricated for abrasion and corrosion protection.  The lubricant should not extrude in use and be of non-petroleum base.

19)	The cable shall have multiple electrical conductors capable of efficient transmission of low power signals at frequencies < 20 kHz.  Cable design should be optimized to permit simultaneous transmission of 5 kHz and 10 kHz signals in a single conductor to armor circuit. 

Performance Specifications:

1)	Finished Diameter: - The finished diameter shall be 8.1788 mm (0.322") at a loading of 15% of RBS.  The diameter shall be uniform over the length of the cable with tolerances of (?0.0508 mm (0.002") and +0.076 mm (0.003")).

2)	Working Diameter: - The change in cable diameter due to a change in cable loading shall not exceed 2% of the finish diameter.  At a loading of 50% RBS the cable diameter shall not be less than 8.03 mm (0.316)".  

3)	Rotation: - The finished cable should not rotate about its axis more than 65 degrees per meter at 40% of RBS.  It is recognized that this requirement may not be met given the specified outer armor wire size and minimum sheave diameter.

4)	Rated Breaking Strength: - > 4500 Kg (10000 lbs) with one end free to rotate.

5)	Flexure Tolerance: - Withstand > 50,000 flexure cycles over sheaves 40 times wire O.D. at 35-40% of RBS without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  

6)	Tension Cycling: - Withstand > 50,000 cycles in tension from 10% to 40% of RBS at an 8 sec. period without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS. 

7)	Sheave Size: - The cable shall be capable of operation with sheaves of tread diameter 38 cm (15").

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  January 2007-December 2007 extendable as required.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Lima, Peru
JOB DESCRIPTION:  See below 

1. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

A.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

BACKGROUND:	This position is located in the U.S. Embassy/Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), Narcotics Control Office, Lima, Peru. The NAS Narcotics Control Office is the liaison between NAS and the Government of Peru?s coca eradication program.  Coca eradication is handled by CORAH (Control y Reduccion de Coca Alto Huallaga), which falls under the Minister of Interior but is fully funded by NAS in the amount of just over $11 million US.  The NCO, with the help of NAS Accounting, oversees the use of that money, final approval control resting with the NCO.  NCO also advises CORAH on strategy and tactics in the field, coordinates eradication support provided by the NAS Aviation and Police programs, and oversees and supports all CORAH logistics, financial management and administration activities.  The NCO is made up of the Narcotics Control Officer, the Eradication Operations Advisor and an Executive Administrator.  

PURPOSE:	The purpose of this professional services contract position is to provide an Eradication Operations Advisor (EOA) to the NAS/NCO coca eradication support program. The incumbent serves as the field advisor to the NAS Narcotics Control Officer (NCO) on all programmed and voluntary eradication activities.  The advisor coordinates programmed eradication operations with CORAH, the Government of Peru/Ministry of the Interior eradication organization.  As required, the advisor coordinates the measuring and monitoring of coca (CADA), the licit crop activities of ICT, CORAH construction projects, NAS administrative matters, and logistical support.  The position requires problem solving, communication, and human relations abilities.  A key responsibility of the EOA is to maintain currency on all NCO activities and stand in for the NCO as needed. 

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:	The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the Narcotics Control Officer; however, the individual exercises wide latitude for independent action, initiating projects and executing approved new programs under general supervision.  The incumbent may coordinate directly with the NAS front office and other US Embassy and GOP agencies for purposes of this program.  Completed work is reviewed for security achieved and effectiveness. 	

2. STATEMENT OF WORK

In the absence of the NCO, the EOA assumes functions of the NCO.  Since this is the case the Deputy must apprise himself of all programs, plans, and operations that may involve the NCO. The major areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to, the following:

A. OVERALL RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA is intricately involved in eradication policy development, approval and implementation.  The advisor provides the NCO information on all matters related to eradication operations by providing field information, documentation and talking points.  Along with the NCO, the EOA represents NAS and USG in policy discussions with host government and other counter-narcotic (CN) agencies related to eradication, interdiction, monitoring and alternative development.

Along with the Narcotics Control Officer, the EOA coordinates the host government approval process of annual eradication work plans with high level GOP officials.

B. STRATEGY AND PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA provides input to the development of US Embassy yearly eradication strategy and goals.  Along with the NCO, the EOA develops goals, objectives and budgets for each project (CORAH, CADA) in accordance with the Mission Program Plan.  In close coordination with CORAH field officers, the EOA develops long-term, short-term and contingency plans of operations for the eradication.

The EOA meets as necessary with NAS program officers and other Mission personnel to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of eradication operations and illicit crop measurement.  In addition, the EOA provides advice and input directly to CORAH, CADA and ICT in the preparation of their annual work plan.  
C. IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA assists CORAH in development of specific eradication plans linked directly to the US Embassy MPPs. The advisor advises on operational strategies based on personal knowledge of specific geographic zones, socio-political influences, and threat conditions.  The EOA conducts field-level liaison and coordination concerning eradication operations with officials of the host government (police, police aviation, officers and enlisted personnel) and other USG agencies.  Also, the EOA oversees implementation of eradication plans, advises counterparts on efficient operational methodology, evaluates effectiveness of those operations from the field, and adapts plans and redirects use of resources as required by changing situations.

The advisor assists counterparts during selection, installation and maintenance of forward base locations, providing a forward NAS presence during eradication operations to monitor and advise Narcotics Control Officer of advances and/or potential problem areas.  In addition, the EOA and CORAH Field Director develop organizational and procedural manuals to document and implement standardized procedures during eradication operations.

D. SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA must consider all security risks while planning eradication operations and constantly assesses security during active eradication operations, notifying CORAH, the NCO, and cooperating USG and GOP agencies about threat levels.

The EOA is responsible for overseeing the implementation of all operational, communications and personnel security programs.

E. LOGISTICS RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA conducts needs assessments for field operations, defining commodity procurement and replacement requirements.  The advisor, as well as the NCO, approves purchases to support eradication operations based on needs and budget allocations. Another responsibility is to monitor the procurement process to ensure purchased items are received in a timely manner and that the goods meet specification requirements. 

F. TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES

The advisor conducts training needs assessments to improve the efficiency of eradication operations, including the conducting of training to develop leadership skills for supervisory personnel and various subject matter training as required. Also, the EOA monitors others as they train using organizational and procedural manuals; performance evaluation is also a responsibility.

G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION RESPONSIBILITIES

While in the field, the advisor must monitor all CORAH/CADA field issues and activities to ensure compliance with all established policies, conducting ongoing evaluations of progress towards objectives and goals.  The field advisor provides early notification to the Narcotics Control Officer to potential problems areas, and conducts on-site inspections to ensure sound professional management principles and practices are applied to prevent waste, fraud or abuse in the use of USG resources.
