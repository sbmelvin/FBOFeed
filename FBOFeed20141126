<DESC>Description in English - On behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), an independent agency of the United States Government, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (FS) is seeking a contractor in Panama or Costa Rica to provide grant evaluator/data-verification services for Panama/Costa Rica. The IAF approves approximately six to eight grants per year per country. Grants are awarded for a one, two, or three-year period and typically include the following mandatory visits: an Evaluator orientation visit, a verification visit every six months or one year, and a final visit after the project has closed. Most grants are for a three-year period; therefore, over the life of a three-year grant the Contractor shall visit the grantee approximately six times. It is estimated that each visit to a grantee takes approximately 5 days, including preparing for the visit (contacting grantee, reading grant documentation, copying reports), travel time, interviews with the grantee and its beneficiaries, and drafting visit reports. This requirement includes the following tasks: contractor shall train grantees in the use of the IAF data collection instrument; train grantees on data collection strategies; assist grantees in the selection of indicators that present problems in collecting the required data; document and verify grant results with grantees, beneficiaries, and grantees' partners; draft reports documenting data verification visit findings; and write project history reports for terminating grants. In addition, when requested by the IAF, contractor shall accompany the IAF staff and Contractors on field trips; provide grant results verification services in other countries; and participate in training and/or conferences. The Contractor shall have fluency in Spanish and possess a working knowledge of Spanish (speaking and writing skills). The Contractor shall have a full time physical presence in Panama or Costa Rica during the 5 year contract, and be willing to travel to remote areas of the country to conduct fieldwork at the grantees' physical location or where grant activities are taking place.
<p>This contract will be a one-year period with four option periods. The Government will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification.</strong></span> Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 626-15-105 - "Replace Roofs" at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System VA Medical Center, Nashville, TN.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF330.  Interested firms should submit their current SF330 to steven.bentley@va.gov. The SF330s are due on December 18, 2014 at 2:00 PM Central Standard Time.  
The Tennessee Valley Healthcare System VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports, and cost estimates, to include construction period services for the "Replace Roofs" design at the TVHS VAMC, 1310 24th Avenue South, Nashville, TN 37212. Work includes architectural, lighting protection, flashing, pipe stands and safety railings, masonry cleaning, way finding and sealant.
The submitted SF330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. A board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, certifications, overall and relevant experience and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. Provide brief resumes of proposed team members who will specifically serve on this project team (such as Project Managers, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Cost Estimator and other key team members). Each resume shall include a minimum of three (3) specific completed projects that best illustrated the team members experience relevant to this project's scope. The resume shall also include years of experience in position and roles each member is listed under. The lead designer in each discipline must be registered.

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
A board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and their technical capabilities (such as design quality management procedures, hospital project design, energy efficiency design procedures, facility electrical design, structural reinforcement and seismic loading) of the Prime firm and any subcontractors. Provide a detailed narrative of up to five (5) maximum relevant projects completed within the last 5 years that best illustrate overall team experience relevant to this project's scope. List relevant projects, to include, experience in architectural, project control, medical facility design work and estimating effectiveness. The board will evaluate, where appropriate, the effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors and prior working relationships).




(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
The board may consider more favorably a firm's experience in projects similar or greater in scope, size and magnitude and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity to accomplish the work within the required time. The board will consider the full potential value of any current A/E contracts that a firm has been awarded when evaluating capacity. For the Prime and each proposed consultant to be assigned to the team, list the larger current projects being designed in the firm's office. Indicate the firm's present workload and the availability of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period. Describe experience in successfully delivering projects per performance schedule, providing timely construction support and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates.

(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.
Information obtained in the Government's Past Performance Information Systems may be accessed and utilized in the evaluation process. Discuss the firm's ability to work with Government entities and design standards or similar relevant experience with other entities. If available, provide a copy of all recent (within the last 3 years) A/E performance evaluations issued for Government contracts. For Non-Federal contracts, provide facility owner documentation of the firm's performance issued on that contract. If no documentation exists, please state so. For Government and Non-Government contracts, provide accessible points of contact: name, title, address, telephone number, email and/or fax number and provide copies of awards and letters of appreciation/commendation, as desired.

(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
Examples of knowledge of the locality include knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.

(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
The SF330 shall contain a signed and dated statement affirming that there are no records of significant claims because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541310.  The SF330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF330 in the "Find a Form" block and click on search.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Service and Maintenance for Ekspla Tunable Laser System

<RESPDATE>121014
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick K Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC><p><br /><br />***NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE***<br /><br />The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Altos Photonics of Bozeman, Montana for the purchase of a service and maintenance plan for NIST's existing Ekspla tunable laser system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).</p>
<p>NIST has a requirement for a five year service and maintenance plan for its Ekspla PL2210B-TR-P100-PG711-DFG tunable laser system which supports research in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies through collaboration.</p>
<p>The NIST CNST's Ekspla PL2210B-TR-P100-PG711 tunable laser is a unique system; only three similar systems have been produced world-wide. However, the laser installed in NIST's CNST is unique as it is the only system in the world with its specific configuration and performance. It is the only laser of its kind installed worldwide which presents the following set of characteristics: broad tunable range (1.55 - 16 &micro;m), picoseconds pulse length, high energy per pulse (up to 500 &micro;J), small line width (&lt; 1 cm-1), and high repetition rate (1 kHz) that are very difficult to obtain simultaneously.</p>
<p>A factory-trained engineer with experience in Ekspla systems is required for service and maintenance of this unique, specialized instrument. Ekspla system information and parts are proprietary and are provided by Ekspla exclusively to Altos Photonics for USA customers of Ekspla instruments. <br /><br />Altos Photonics is the only contractor that can provide service and maintenance for the Ekspla PL2210B-TR-P100-PG711-DFG tunable laser system. Therefore, Altos Photonics is uniquely qualified to provide the required service and maintenance.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule. This requirement is expected to be awarded in December, 2014.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on December 10, 2014. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>November 25th 2014<br />Requisition #: 15-002809<br />Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The National Institute of Health Office of Purchasing and Contracts intends to negotiate and award a blanket purchase contract to Stago Parsippany, NY 07054 to provide various reagents, kits and other commodity items for the Stago Sta-R Evolution instrument for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302-1.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339112, and the size standard is 500 Employees</p>
<p>This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC).</p>
<p>The DLM Hematology Service provides laboratory support for patient care and research protocols and performs research and training in disciplines of Clinical Pathology. In doing so it provides state-of-the-art laboratory testing in support of Clinical Center patient care and serves as a center of excellence in research and training in laboratory medicine, particularly in areas which utilize the unique strengths of the National Institutes of Health. <br />The Diagnostica Stago Inc. will provide kits and reagents used to analyze all Coagulation and Thrombosis related testing samples for Clinical Center patients. The two Coagulation analyzers-STA-R- Evolution will perform the Prothrombin Time Assay, activated Prothrombin Time Assay, Fibrinogen Assay, Thrombin Time Assay, D-Dimer Assay, Mixing Studies Assays, Kaolin Clotting Time Assay, Factor Assays, Antithrombin III Assay, Alpha 2 Antiplasmin Assay, Protein C Assay, Protein S Assay, Lupus Anticoagulant Assays, Anti Xa Assays, Plasminogen Assay, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor -1 Assay, Reptilase Assay, von Willebrand Antigen and Activity Assays and monitor therapeutic for Direct Thrombin inhibitor.<br />The proposed vendor, Diagnostic Stago Inc., is the sole manufacturer, distributor, and service provider for the STA-R Evolution (and its products) and is the only system of this type that has the capability to perform all of these testings to fit our patient population and protocols at the Clinical Center. <br />Since only one supplier, Diagnostica Stago Inc. will fit the instrumentation validations and requirements, any other supply or service could cause the cancellation of the protocol/delays in completion of the protocol.</p>

A proper invoice is an "Original" which must include the items listed in subdivisions 1 through 12, below, in addition to the requirements of FAR 32.9. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish, and 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils) with a statement of the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. (See exceptions under II., below.) Untimely notification will be taken into account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p>1. Vendor/Contractor: Name, Address, Point of Contact for the invoice (Name, title, telephone number, e-mail and mailing address of point of contact). <br />2. Remit-to address (Name and complete mailing address to send payment). <br />3. Remittance name must match exactly with name on original order/contract.

Unique invoice #s for all invoices per vendor regardless of site. <br />6. NBS document number formats must be included for awards created in the NBS: Contract Number; Purchase Order Number; Task or Delivery Order Number and Source Award Number (e.g., Indefinite Delivery Contract number; General Services Administration number); or, BPA Call Number and BPA Parent Award Number. <br />7. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) or DUNS + 4 as registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). <br />8. Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). In those exceptional cases where a contractor does not have a DUNS number or TIN, a Vendor Identification Number (VIN) must be referenced on the invoice. The VIN is the number that appears after the contractor's name on the face page of the award document. <br />9. Identify that payment is to be made using a three-way match. <br />10. Description of supplies/services that match the description on the award, by line billed.* <br />11. Freight or delivery charge must be billed as shown on the award.

Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price, Extended Price of supplies delivered or services performed, as applicable, and that match the line items specified in the award.*</p>
<p>* NOTE: If your invoice must differ from the line items on the award, please contact the Contracting Officer before submitting the invoice. A modification to the order or contract may be needed before the invoice can be submitted and paid.</p>
<p>B. Shipping costs will be reimbursed only if authorized by the Contract/Purchase Order. If authorized, shipping costs must be itemized. Where shipping costs exceed $100, the invoice must be supported by a bill of lading or a paid carrier's receipt.</p>
<p><br />C. Mail an original copy of the itemized invoice to:</p>

<p>For inquiries regarding payment call: (301) 496-6088</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the prompt payment of invoices, it is recommended that the vendor submit a photocopy of the invoice to the "Consignee" designated for the acquisition in blocks 6A - 6E of the face page of the Order/Award document.</p>
<p>II. Invoice Payment</p>
<p>A. Except as indicated in paragraph B., below, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:</p>
<p>1. The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice. <br />2. The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p>B. The due date for making invoice payments for meat and meat food products, perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, and edible fats or oils, shall be in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act, as amended.</p>
<p>III. Interest Penalties</p>
<p>A. An interest penalty shall be paid automatically, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed below are met, if applicable.</p>
<p>1. A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office. <br />2. A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with an term or condition. <br />3.

<p>B. Determination of interest and penalties due will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, the Contract Disputes Act, and regulations issued by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>IV. PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS, 52.232-99 (DEVIATION) (August 2013)</p>
<p>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012, and the extension to that policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-13-15, Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2013.</p>
<p>a. Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor. <br />b. Include the substance of this article, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns. <br />c. The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.</p>

<DESC><br />The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure, on an other than full and open competition basis under the authority of FAR 6.302, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency need. This contract is for research and development for the AV-8B Joint Systems Support Activity (JSSA).
<p>The Navy intends to enter into negotiations for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (FFP) contract. The contract period of performance is for two years.</p>
<p>Until recently the AV-8B has been constrained by internal volume from implementing Link-16 i.e., there was no place in the aircraft to place a Link-16 MIDS terminal. The hardware technology for Link-16 has now produced several small form factor Link-16 terminal product lines that canbe accommodated inside the AV-8B aircraft. A technical demonstration is necessary to confirm at least one of the available small form factor Link-16 products can achieve functionality using existing aircraft electrical power, antennas and computer processing. Modifications to the Interference Blanker Unit and the Identification Friend or Foe avionics will also be required. These are the tasks that necessitate a sole source contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the aircraft. The results of the technical demonstration will be the basis for an Engineering Change Proposal to implement Link-16 in the AV-8B fleet. The estimated total value of the contract is $11.4M.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without causing programmatic hardship or duplication of cost to the Government. Requests for the solicitation shall be submitted to the contracting office and reference solicitation number N68936-15-R-0049. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses and requests shall be submitted by email to joel.ashworth@navy.mil or christopher.burchett@navy.mil or to Commander, Code 254120D (C. Burchett), NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd, MS 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108. Award is anticipated in third quarter FY 2015.</p>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) on behalf of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) intends to execute a modification to extend the period of performance under contract EP-W-09-024 with Battelle Memorial Institute using the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.
The modification will allow for continued support of ongoing OPPT regulatory and non-regulatory efforts so that there is no lapse in service while the follow-on contract is competed. Uninterrupted support is required for high priority projects including support for work plan chemicals; the Lead Public & Commercial Buildings rulemaking of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Title IV; support for the Renovation, Repair and Painting rule of TSCA Title IV; and support for the laboratory analyses and identifications for samples collected in the 2013-2014 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) in the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) program.
The EPA intends to extend the contract for six months. This extension is necessary due government delays in awarding the competitive follow-on contract. The period of this extension is from December 22, 2014 through June 22, 2015.
NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. It has been determined that Battelle Memorial Institute is the only source that meets the Government?s requirements. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as stated herein, may submit its capability by 4:00 PM on Thursday, December 11, 2014, which may be considered by the Government. A determination not to conduct a competitive acquisition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Christine Edwards at edwards.christine@epa.gov.

Overview:

The purpose of this unclassified request for information (RFI) is to enable the National Veterans Wheelchair Games (NVWG) representatives to obtain information from vendors who can provide labor, supervision, and other resources required to provide Wheelchair Bus Service to transport over 600 Veterans with physical disabilities and over 400 non-wheelchair users for a total period of eight (8) days, from June 20 through June 27, 2015 in Dallas, TX.  The vendor will need to provide adequate equipment and personnel to provide the accessible transportation services.  The buses need to be retrofitted full size, kneeling, low floor buses with self-storing wheelchair ramps to accommodate wheelchairs to safely transport large numbers of individuals in wheelchairs to various areas within the Dallas, Texas community.  In addition, this work will involve equipment and retrofit review, pre-event retrofitting of one bus for VA staff/volunteer training, site visit involvement for route review to venues, staff training of employees providing Veteran transportation and on-site Project Manager during event hours. Vendor must be able to operate about twenty-two buses during specific peak times during the NVWG that the schedule requires.

Background: The National Veterans Wheelchair Games represent the largest annual wheelchair sports event in the world.  Participation in the NVWG is open to Veterans with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities that require the use of a wheelchair for competitive sports. The NVWG has 18 official events which include air rifle, air pistol, archery, basketball, boccia, bowling, field, handcycling, motor rally, nine ball, power soccer, quad rugby, slalom, softball, swimming, table tennis, track and trap shooting requiring transportation for over 600 Veterans in wheelchairs and 400 non-wheelchair users (able bodied caregivers / participants).

The NVWG transportation requires the following technical requirements in order to support the unique needs of our customers and program requirements. 
1.	Twenty two low floor, kneeling buses that are able to accommodate 6 to 8 passengers in wheelchairs, plus an additional 12-15 able bodied passengers;
2.	Buses with incorporated automatic, self-storing wheelchair ramps.  Lift systems cannot handle the workload demands and loading requirements of the program;
3.	Buses must be able to be loaded / unloaded within 15 minutes to ensure no schedule delays.

The NVWG will use this information to gain a better understanding of industry's ability to support the event transportation needs.  This information will be fundamental to shaping the Department's future facilitation efforts.  

If you are interested in participating in this market research, you must respond by e-mail (details below) no later than December 4, 2014, 2:30 pm central time to include attachment 1.

<DESC>Description <P> This notice issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC), Edwards, CA is a Request for Information (RFI) for Microgravity Flight Services or MFS.  The intent of this notice is to obtain information on commercial capabilities to provide brief periods of near zero, partial gravity, and hyper-gravity conditions, collectively referred to here as microgravity, and associated capabilities for payload integration, safety, and airworthiness for various Government research, technology development, and training missions. Attached to this notice is a Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) that contains the technical and operational requirements for the NASA Microgravity Mission. NASA has successfully achieved this mission and fully met the attached requirements by use of a slightly modified C-9 (military variant of the DC-9 commercial transport) aircraft flown, operated, and maintained by NASA flight and ground crews. <P> Microgravity flights provide a unique "reduced gravity" or "zero-g" environment as well as hyper gravity (1.1 through 1.8 times normal earth gravity) and simulated Lunar, Martian, and asteroid gravity levels for research in areas such as fluid physics, combustion, material sciences, and life sciences, engineering development (for the International Space Station and other space hardware programs); for education; and for astronaut flight crew training. <P> The typical operation involves one or more self-contained experiments that are installed on the platform and activated in flight during the microgravity periods by a human operator. Data is recorded, and experiments are often photographed. Upon completion of the flight, the experiment is removed to be refurbished and prepared for future flights. The experiments are usually observed and/or tended during flights by a human experimenter.  Reduced gravity parabolic trajectories and increased gravity constant-g maneuvers are normally within the design envelope of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certificated jet transport aircraft; however, the repeated parabolic trajectories may constitute additional duty cycles that manufacturers did not consider in the design of their aircraft and engines. <P> In the recent past, aircraft and flight services were contracted by NASA to provide these services and were operated in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 00-1.1A, Public Aircraft Operations. Under this AC, NASA was responsible for determining the airworthiness and flight safety of the Contractors microgravity aircraft operations and maintenance. As a Public Use aircraft operation, NASA reviewed and approved any deviations to Federal Aviation Regulation Part 21, 23, 25, 27, 33, 35, 43, 61, 63, 65, 67, 91, and 121 as needed to accomplish NASA research missions in accordance with the intent of the AC 00-1.1A and applicable NASA policies. Consequently, contractors for NASA Microgravity Aircraft services were required to maintain a program that allows sufficient NASA insight to approve FAA regulatory deviations for the NASA mission while the contractor aircraft was operated as Public Use. Upon the completion of a NASA mission the aircraft was returned to its original civil status and returned to service under FAA airworthiness regulations. It was the responsibility of the contractor to ensure compliance with all FAA regulations when returning an aircraft to civil use. <P> NASA is assessing the feasibility of obtaining microgravity flight services on a purely commercial basis. In such an operation, the provider will operate as a civil aircraft and bears full responsibility for airworthiness, flight safety, and mission assurance, and these services do not require Public Aircraft Operation (PAO  ref. AC 001.1A) with commensurate NASA airworthiness approvals. Recognizing the ability of industry to provide microgravity flight services to the public at large, responders are required to provide information on the practicality of providing this service to NASA in accordance with the attached NASA PWS utilizing certificated aircraft with an FAA approved maintenance and operations plan that does not depend upon NASA airworthiness authority under a Public Aircraft Operations concept. <P> Under a non-PAO concept, NASA will provide limited airworthiness oversight for payload design and payload integration for NASA payloads only.	In accordance with its policy NPR 7900.3C (<A HREF="http://go.usa.gov/sWt9">http://go.usa.gov/sWt9 </A>	), NASA will also perform an initial airworthiness review including a physical inspection of the proposed aircraft and detailed review of its maintenance records. <P> Responders are required to provide information regarding their aircraft and engine manufacturers engineering evaluations that demonstrate the suitability of their aircraft and engines for the microgravity mission. The manufacturers engineering evaluations shall include recommendations for aircraft and engine modifications, operations, life limitations, structural monitoring, and maintenance. <P> Responders are required to provide information regarding their aircraft operations and maintenance per Title 14 CFR Part 121 or 135 , and any additional FAA requirements to meet the microgravity mission. <P> Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet the requirements must submit a capability statement. All maintenance and operational actions required to support the microgravity flight service mission must be addressed in the capability statement. <P> In addition to the previously listed requirements, the Capability Statement shall include the following: <P> 1. Does your organization have the capability to provide the services as described in the attached PWS? If so, please describe your capabilities and performance history for the following.  Include other pertinent capabilities. Describe your capabilities to meet the requirements of the attached PWS. Describe the platform environment you can provide for experiments, including the number of independent experiment packages you are capable of accommodating per flight, the maximum volume and mass of experiments, the types and sources of power, environmental conditions and ability to vary environments, and ability to accommodate human flight participants Describe any restrictions on payload contents (e.g. mass. volume, battery types, gasses, temperatures, etc.) Describe your typical flight profiles for microgravity conditions, including a zero-g parabola (altitude/airspeed profile, as well as partial g-level profile) and hyper-gravity maneuvers up to 1.8 gravities <P> 2. Provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for annual contract costs using the attached Respondent Cost Metric and Proposed Performance Metric spreadsheets.  Please show any formulas used to calculate costs. <P> 3. How would you manage a microgravity program including maintenance and operation of the aircraft; customer support; and payload integration? Describe the aircraft make and model you would propose using to provide these services Describe your engineering capability for integrating custom payload types Describe your airworthiness and flight safety processes, and how you intend to operate within FAA approval guidelines as an FAA-certificated aircraft. Describe your base of operations to support microgravity flight operations. Describe the location of your airfield and microgravity flight operations, and your access to aircraft ground support equipment and fuel. Describe your capabilities for payload integration, including how you assess the airworthiness of payloads and how you isolate payloads from aircraft systems Describe your ground facilities for experimenter preflight preparation and postflight maintenance of their experiments Describe your capabilities to provide special systems, such as lighting, intercom, precision gravity monitoring, etc. <P> 4. What, if any, are the barriers to utilizing your aircraft to provide microgravity flight services as a certificated aircraft? Include how you would eliminate or mitigate potential barriers to utilizing your aircraft as Other than a Public Aircraft. <P> 5. How do you plan to certify airworthiness and approve any necessary modifications to the aircraft type certificate? <P> 6. What, if anything, would you require from NASA in order to provide microgravity flight services and other proposed services while operating your aircraft as a certificated aircraft? <P> 7. Provide specific comments on the technical and operational requirements and the ease or difficulty you would have in meeting them. <P> 8. What other recommendations or concepts of operation do you have on how to provide Microgravity Flight Services to support the NASA mission? <P> 9. NASA is interested in innovative approaches to achieving this mission, including use of smaller aircraft types (biz jet class rather than transport class), multiple aircraft types, or other innovative approaches including a multiple-award contract for achieving the full range of requirements from more than one vendor. Please provide any constructive suggestions toward this end. Explain the advantages of your suggested approach and potential barriers to executing the controlled gravity mission that you believe would be resolved by your approach. <P> 10.  As the requirement becomes more defined, we will consider other NAICS Codes.  Please provide any imput that may be beneficial to consider when selecting the NAICS code for Microgravity Flight Services. <P> Responses must include the following: <P> 1. Name and address of firm and the name of the author of the suggestions. <P> 2. Size of business; average annual revenue for the past three years and number of employees. <P> 3. Whether the firm is a large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, Women Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions. <P> 4. Number of years in business. <P> 5. Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners and potential teaming partners. <P> INDUSTRY DAY <P> An Industry Day will be held from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm on December 9, 2014 at the AERO Institute in Palmdale, CA.  During the morning of Industry Day, the requirements listed in the PWS and the ROM will be discussed in detail.

<DESC>Immigration and Customs Enforcement<br />Request for Information<br />Armed Transportation Services<br />San Antonio Area
<p><br />U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking information regarding vendors capable of providing transportation services to provide, operate, and manage the armed transportation and escort of detainees in ICE custody. Services will be primarily, but not limited to, locations within the San Antonio Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR) and in some cases to locations in bordering states. Contractor will be evaluated on ability to respond timely to pick-up and drop off times required by ICE. The contractor will abide by all rules and regulations governing Detention/Transportation Officer Performance.</p>
<p>All responses to this synopsis should be sent via email to Roberta O. Onuma, the Contract Specialist, at Roberta.O.Onuma@ice.dhs.gov, and Richard Edge, the Contracting Officer's Representative, at Richard.J.Edge@ice.dhs.gov by December 11, 2014.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice and submissions are for market research purposes only.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a capabilities statement in PDF format [15 pages or less] by the response date.</p>
<p>All business sizes are welcome to respond; however, ICE is specifically trying to determine small business interest.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>
<p>DO duties include, but are not limited to, armed transportation services, escorting detainees to and from transport vehicles, monitoring detainees in custody, conducting limited pat-downs and personal property accountability.</p>
<p>The contractor will furnish these services including all vehicles, management staff, supervision, manpower, relief officers, uniforms, equipment, fuel and supplies (including firearms, body restraints, non-lethal devices, body armor, cellular telephones and radios) to provide transportation services. The contractor will be required to establish and maintain a web-based secure computer system accessible by multiple Government users simultaneously with the ability to acknowledge receipt of Government Transportation Service Requests (G-391s), display all scheduled routes and track real time status of ongoing missions.</p>
<p>Contract staff needs to be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days per week, to ensure the transportation requirements are performed at the appropriate frequency. Two person teams of armed DOs are required for each transport mission. During all transportation services, at least one officer must be the same sex as the detainee. If a same-sex officer is not available, the transportation mission must be approved by the COR/CO as per ICE Policy guidelines.</p>
<p>The San Antonio Field Office averages about 2,400 routes a month, traveling an average of 500,000 miles per month. It would be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the detainees are transported in the most safe and economical manner. The Contractor will provide the appropriate transport vehicle (bus, van, and/or sedan).</p>
<p>Anticipated Routes/Destinations:<br />&bull; Various County Jails<br />&bull; Processing Centers<br />&bull; Local Hospitals <br />&bull; Court Houses<br />&bull; Juvenile Centers<br />&bull; Points of Apprehension<br />&bull; Ports of Entry<br />&bull; US Border Patrol Stations<br />&bull; Airports</p>
<p>Required Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>Business Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor is responsible to obtain all business permits and licenses prior to performance of a contract.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall (depending on the state's requirements) be licensed as a quality security company in accordance with the requirements of the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; Throughout the term of a contract, the Contractor would be required to maintain currency of ALL permits/business licenses and make them available for government inspection. The Contractor will be required to comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.<br />- Firearms Requirements<br />- Body Armor Requirements</p>
<p>Licensing of Employees<br />&bull; Before the commencement of services under a contract, the Contractor would be required to ensure each employee has the appropriate registration, commissions, permits and licenses as required by the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; The Contractor would be required to verify all licenses and certifications. If applicable, Contractor staff shall posses a current license/registration for the state(s) in which they are performing.</p>
<p>Standards and Policies</p>
<p>ICE requires that Contractors comply with all required Standards and Policies. These include but are not limited to:<br />&bull; American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Detention Facilities (most current edition) and the most recent copy of the supplement issued every two years.<br />&bull; The DHS / ICE 2011 Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) - A copy is attainable through the following website: http://www.ice.gov/detention-standards/2011. <br />&bull; Post Orders<br />&bull; General Directives<br />&bull; U.S. Department of Transportation Regulations<br />&bull; All rules and regulations governing public buildings and grounds.</p>
<p>Personnel Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Background Investigations and Suitability Screenings would be conducted on all Contract Employees by the Office of Professional Responsibility and Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU).<br />&bull; Contractors would agree that each employee working on a contract will successfully pass the DHS Employment Eligibility Verification (E-Verify) program operated by USCIS to establish work authorization and U.S. Citizenship.<br />&bull; Employees must reside in the United States.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a system to inject gaseous precursors into an FEI Helios NanoLab 650 dual beam system for material etching and electron/ion-beam induced deposition to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The system will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the tools that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>A Gas Injection System (GIS) controls the introduction of precursor gas into a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or Focused Ion Beam (FIB) in such a way that the gas is directed over a sample surface and highly localized. The precursor gas may contain chemistry for etching of material or for deposition of solid material from a gaseous source using an electron or ion beam. A standard GIS only contains a single gas. The design of SEM/FIB dual beam instruments has a limited number of ports available with the optimal geometry for GIS mounting; meaning a limited number of gases may be used in the instrument. A multiple gas injection system that mounts in a single port increases the deposition capabilities of the instrument. In order to increase NIST's capability to serve users and provide improved process performance and productivity for nanofabrication, NIST has a need for a multiple gas injection system. The system shall meet the specifications described below.</p>
<p>1. General<br />The multiple gas injection system will be permanently mounted onto an FEI Helios 650 dual beam instrument and is intended to be used by researchers to control the temperature, flow, and positioning of precursor vapor to enable gas assisted etching and deposition of various materials onto a sample surface via beam assisted deposition.</p>
<p>2. System configuration<br />a. The system shall be mounted to an FEI Helios 650 (hereafter referred to as the host instrument) and include the following components:<br />(1) Hardware for precursor containment, temperature control, and precise injection control;<br />(2) An alternative vacuum path that allows purging of precursor pressures without effecting chamber vacuum and normal operation;<br />(3) A library of beam assisted deposition and etching recipes and associated control hardware and software. <br />b. The system must have capability for at least six (6) precursor sources to maximize system flexibility<br />c. The system must have a single needle delivery system to facilitate gas mixing and ease of use.<br />d. The system must provide motorized needle positioning with memory for saved positions.<br />e. The system must provide a safety feature to automatically close gas delivery valves to prevent chemical exposure to users when venting the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>3. Instrument compatibility<br />a. The system must not interfere with the normal configuration or operation of the host instrument.<br />b. The system must not invalidate the current warranty of the host instrument<br />c. The system must be equipped with collision detection to minimize damage to the needle and sample surface when inserting the gas delivery needle.<br />d. The system control software shall integrate with the user interface of the host instrument to minimize current user re-training</p>
<p>4. System capability<br />a. The system should be able to perform gaseous precursor delivery of the following types: <br />i. Carbon;<br />ii. Platinum;<br />iii. Tungsten;<br />iv. Silicon oxides;<br />v. Water vapor;<br />vi. XeF2 <br />b. The system must be able to deliver the precursor gasses into the vacuum chamber as specified in a process recipe. <br />c. The system shall be able to control substrate exposure to precursor gas by closing delivery valves at the end of a recipe.<br />d. The system shall be able to control and deliver mixtures of compatible precursor gasses according to the recipe set by the instrument user.<br />e. The system shall be able to automatically heat the precursor gasses to the optimal temperature.<br />f. The system shall be able to automatically cool one (1) or more precursor gasses when not in use to provide compatibility with precursors requiring refrigeration<br />g. The system shall be able to purge precursor gases between operations to prevent cross contamination between different chemicals.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.<br /><br />
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE<br />The Index Section of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is responsible for the indexing of biomedical and life sciences journals for MEDLINE, which is the primary component provided by the NLM National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) as part of PubMed. NCBI was established at NLM in 1988 and serves as a national resource for molecular biology information by creating public databases (such as PubMed), conducting research in computational biology, developing software tools for analyzing genome data, and disseminating biomedical information (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/ncbi.html). Information pertaining to MEDLINE is available at the NLM Web site: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html. Journals are selected for MEDLINE indexing by recommendations made by the NLM Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (LSTRC), an advisory group of experts that has been established to review journal titles and assess their quality.<br /><br />Indexing policies and procedures used at NLM are detailed in the NLM Indexing Manual, which is supplemented by MeSH annotations and other indexing aids. The major effort required for indexing is the intellectual analysis of journal articles for subject matter and the application of appropriate subject terms drawn from the NLM controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Access to MeSH is available via the NLM MeSH Browser at: www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html. See also the NLM fact sheet on MeSH at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/mesh.html.<br /><br />The MEDLINE indexing work on this contract will be performed using the Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS, see Attachment F). DCMS was developed at NLM specifically for MEDLINE indexing and during the course of this contract, it is possible that this system may be modified or replaced with a more efficient production system. Access to DCMS is restricted to authorized users. For further information on DCMS see the NLM fact sheet http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/online_indexing_system.html<br /><br />In addition to indexing article citations with MeSH terms, indexers may also make links to other NCBI databases, such as Gene, via a process called Gene Indexing, which entails the creation of an annotated link between a record in the PubMed Gene database and a MEDLINE citation. As MEDLINE indexers perform subject analysis and indexing of a journal article they must recognize that an article requires Gene Indexing when the main point is basic genetic, chemical, or functional information about a gene or protein. The indexer must identify the appropriate record in the Gene database and create a link between the Gene record and the MEDLINE citation. The indexer then creates a short statement or sentence fragment, often extracted directly from the abstract or article text, that describes the new information about the gene or protein that is reported in the article. DCMS is programmed to interact with Gene so that Gene Indexing may be performed efficiently and accurately.<br /><br />The quantity of articles for MEDLINE indexing increases continuously and reaches new records every year. Because of this growth and the corresponding need to scale indexing capacity, NLM pursues many methods to improve indexing efficiency and streamline workflows. One example is the development of automated indexing software, referred to as the Medical Text Indexer (MTI), which has been an integral part of DCMS since 2002. MTI can be called upon at any time to assist the indexer by suggesting MeSH terms based upon data from the article title, abstract, and PubMed related citations. In 2011, the MTI algorithm was refined to create the MTI First Line (MTIFL) indexing tool, which provides a "first line" of automated indexing. MTIFL is then curated by a human indexer in a process called MTIFL Completion. In 2014, MTIFL Completion was evaluated in a pilot study in the Contract Indexer environment, and it is now being integrated into production DCMS indexing. MTIFL Completion allows NLM to provide access to the ever-expanding biomedical literature.<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to obtain indexing for approximately 679,000 biomedical journal articles for MEDLINE, 75,000 MTIFL Completion articles, and creating approximately 82,000 Gene Links per year. Indexing is also sought for up to 7,800 chemical queries per year by chemical indexers, and for up to 2,100 records per year for the HSRProj database. These quantities are for the base year of a contract that is expected to have multiple annual options with the rate of growth being approximately 4% for journal articles, and a proportional number of gene links. The duration of this contract will consist of a one-year base period, followed by four option years for a total of five years. NLM expects each of these tasks: MEDLINE indexing, MTIFL Completion, Gene Links, chemicals, and HSRProj to be priced separately.<br /><br />A list of possible subject areas included for MEDLINE appears as Attachment A. Most of the journal articles are in English; the remainder are in various foreign languages, which accounted for approximately 43,000 of the articles indexed in 2013. Most of the journals currently indexed for MEDLINE are published exclusively on the Internet, with no print counterpart; therefore, only a small proportion of print journals will be used for MEDLINE indexing. There are no differences in the indexing requirements for print and online journals and indexers may be assigned either type of article depending upon their subject expertise and NLM needs.<br /><br />The Contractor must furnish services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this contract, as needed to perform the work set in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />NLM pursues continuous improvements in indexing efficiency, functionality, and application. Improvement efforts are expected to continue during the time period of this contract with possible changes in MeSH, indexing software, indexing procedures, indexing policies, or indexing philosophy.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disable, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. This Sources Sought notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:<br /><br />(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above.

<DESC>The Network Contracting Office (NCO) 4 is issuing this request for information/sources sought notice in order to identify businesses that have the resources, capabilities, and expertise to provide teleradiology services for VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System's (hereinafter referred to as VAPHS) Imaging Service.

The Contractor shall furnish all personnel to provide services necessary to Teleradiology Services to eligible beneficiaries of the VAPHS.  The contractor shall provide professional offsite radiology services for after-hours interpretation of imaging studies performed at the VAPHS.  Specifically, the contractor will provide final interpretations for imaging studies performed 5PM-8AM 7 days per week, 365 per year.  There needs to be an interpretation of each imaging study available within 60 minutes after the completion of the study for each case.  This will be in the form of a final interpretation within 60 minutes, followed by a final interpretation within 4 hours.  Each final interpretation needs to be in the form of electronic signed report in the VA hospitals information system.  There may be infrequent occasions where the final interpretations of imaging studies are requested for periods between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 pm (daylight).  These circumstances would occur only during delay in image readings.  This would be considered a rare and exceptional circumstance but the services would need to be available.  
Contractors must have able to support Nuance PowerScribe 360, Philips IntelliSpace PACS 4.4 and Windows 7 or demonstrate capability to obtain this ability within 30 days of a contract award.

NCO4 is seeking responses to the following types of information from businesses that consider themselves to have the resources, capabilities and expertise essential to providing the teleradiology services: 

1.  Company name, business type, socio-economic status (e.g., Veteran-Owned, Woman-Owned, Disadvantaged Small Business, 8(a), etc.), person of contact (including telephone number & email address).
2.  Previous experience in providing teleradiology services for government or non-government healthcare entities (i.e., VA Medical Centers, hospitals).
3.  Common approach(es) to teleradiology operations .
4.  Common obstacles and risks associated with providing teleradiology services. 
5.  Common performance standards and assessment methods. 
6. Capability to support Nuance PowerScribe 360, Philips IntelliSpace PACS 4.4, Windows 7 or capability to obtain in 30 days of a contract award.
7.  Other information relevant to teleradiology services that's not addressed in 1- 6 that would be beneficial to Pittsburgh VA Medical Center's endeavor in developing its requirement.

Responses to the information requested above may be submitted (1) via email to Kristina.Weir@va.gov.  

The results of this market research will assist in the development of (1) the requirement, and (2) the acquisition strategy (e.g., small business set-aside, full and open competition, etc.).

Responses must be submitted by 11:00 AM (EST) December 8, 2014.

This request for information/sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes ONLY.  NCO4 assumes no responsibility for any costs incurred associated with the preparation of responses submitted as a result of this notice.

<p>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for December is December 1, 2014 to December 07, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks, and Chester counties in Pennsylvania; Camden, Burlington, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey; and New Castle County in Delaware.  <br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for December is December 1, 2014 to December 7, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties, also to include the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>Real Time Location System (RTLS) Hand Hygiene 
Request for information (RFI)
November 26, 2015

This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  The purpose of this RFI is to search for qualified contractors capable of meeting the requirements to provide a Real Time Location Services (RTLS)-based Hand Hygiene (HH) solution. 

This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid, Request for Task Execution Plan, Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI nor does it restrict the Government in its acquisition approach.  Contractors will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs incurred in responding to this RFI.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy.  Respondents are responsible for marking proprietary, restricted, or competition sensitive information contained in their response.

1.	BACKGROUND

RTLS is an umbrella term that includes multiple technologies for locating and tracking items.  It includes Wi-Fi based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, including low frequency and infrared.  Within VA, RTLS refers to a collection of applications, including Asset Tracking, automated Temperature Monitoring, Cardiac Catheterization Lab supply monitoring, Sterile Processing Workflow, and surgical instrument tracking.  Each of these applications is integrated with Intelligent InSites software solution and when there is a need for active RTLS tracking capabilities, CenTrak hardware is used.  CenTrak hardware includes asset tags and staff tags, as well as a supplementary wireless sensing infrastructure used to increase the system's accuracy of location identification: low-frequency exciters and infrared beacons/monitors.  In addition, VA is evaluating options to expand RTLS to include automated tracking of HH compliance, prevention of Patient Elopement and Wandering, and applications for Emergency Room and Operating Room Workflow.  The potential uses and benefits of this technology throughout VA are significant, and include improvement of quality of patient care, improved patient satisfaction, reduction of health care asset management costs, improvement of capacity/resource planning, improvement of employee and patient safety, as well as improvement of general asset management and inventory.

The Government anticipates the scope of work for the HH program to include the design, installation, configuration, and test of an RTLS-based HH solution.  The solution may be designed to meet the needs of a specific VA Facility (To Be Determined) based upon their current HH business.  The solution may include project management to oversee the implementation of the RTLS-based HH solution and the delivery of associated training services for the selected VA Facility.  The solution may include hardware and software components that fulfill the VA-approved design.  This effort may require services to conduct site surveys, update facility drawings, and system configuration documentation for the HH solutions.  Additionally, transition services may be required.

The potential contract period of performance is undetermined at this time.  An award is forecasted during the third or fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.  

2.	HAND WASHING USE CASE

VA Database Interfaces Required
"	None
	Technology Considerations
"	Software
o	Solution must integrate with Intelligent Insites
"	Hardware
o	Active tagging
"	Solution must utilize existing CenTrak wireless sensing infrastructure 
"	Solution must utilize CenTrak staff or asset tags 
	System Functionality
"	Capture all possible hand washing opportunities along with all washing events
o	Need to capture this level of data discretely even if there are multiple hand washing dispensers and beds within close proximity
"	Validation based on activity at station, not proximity
Use case goal is to validate staff hand sanitizing rates.  VA deploys hand washing stations at all sinks and also at stationary locations throughout the facility via a sanitizing dispensing station or a sink.  It is expected that hand washing rates can be monitored as a staff member approaches a sanitizing station and activates a dispensing container.  The system would have the capability to monitor the sanitizing compliance, i.e., hand hygiene sensing device detects the dispensing of the sanitizing product and would communicate via staff tag to record the event.  System would monitor the hand sanitizing after restroom use, after scheduled breaks, and entering or exiting occupied patient care area.  Functionality for a system that has the capability of alerting or reminding staff to wash their hands is also desired.
High level requirements - 
2.1.	The system should detect if the employee sanitized their hands and for how long.
2.2.	The system should detect and report if the employee had not sanitized their hands sufficiently.  
2.3.	The system shall allow users the capability to run reports that show contact between patients and staff by means of room/bed-level proximity.  This shall allow for better management and prevention of the spread of contagious diseases.
2.4.	The system shall allow users the capability to run reports that show caregiver hand-hygiene compliance.

3.	SAMPLE MEDICAL CENTER

"	Healthcare workers to be monitored for HH compliance = 885
"	Units to be covered = ICU, PCU, Community Living Center
"	Quantity of hand hygiene dispensers that should be monitored = 389
"	Quantity of patient rooms that should be monitored = 145
"	Quantity of beds that should be monitored = 261
"	Number of in person training sessions required = 16
"	Period of performance = 12 months
"	Place of performance = Los Angeles, CA 

4.	RESPONSES REQUESTED

The Government seeks capability statements that provide feedback on "Appendix A - Requirements Specification Document (RSD)" to enable the Government to consider and or implement industry best practices and procedures and to address any questions or concerns that industry may have regarding the requirement.  Capability statements should include a brief analysis of each of the requirements within the RSD in comparison to the functional and technical capabilities of the proposed solution.  The response should identify which RSD requirements are met with existing capabilities and which requirements would require custom development in order to achieve the performance requirement.  The response should also confirm the ability to use existing CenTrak hardware and infrastructure and identify the estimated level of effort required (if any) to fully integrate with the VA RTLS.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of research support in the area of applied statistical analysis, experimental design and reliability modeling for the Department of Defense Test and Evaluation Enterprise. Specifically, the research support requires investigating extensions to split plot experimental designs and complex designs power analysis and size determinations, examining designs for problems with non-normal responses and designs for software systems, and investigating incorporating statistics of extremes into the analysis of experiments. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Business size standard is for NAICS 541712 is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Arizona State University. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 5 December 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The DOD is incorporating Designs of Experiments (DOE) into its test enterprise, where testing is a critical aspect of any DOD systems acquisition. However, the adoption of these methods is relatively new and many of the DOD test organizations are just beginning to appreciate the benefits. Dr. Douglas Montgomery, a faculty member at Arizona State University, is a leading statistician in the United States, and his Designs of Experiments (DOE) textbook is widely recognized publication, which is relied upon for DOD discussions pertaining to DOE. Dr. Montgomery is the only source that will satisfy agency requirements in the case of a continuation of a multi-year line of research.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Kelli.Vaughn@us.af.mil no later than 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 5 December 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>

DESCRIPTION<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, Battlespace Surveillance Innovation Branch (RVBY), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking information to support its research and development (R&amp;D) mission to advance radiation hardened, space-worthy lasers for use in atomic systems. <br />The AFRL Strategic Atomic Navigation Devices and Systems (SANDS) program, seeks to advance robust precision radiation hardened lasers through partnerships with industry. The SANDS portfolio is comprised of solid state inertial navigation instrumentation (i.e., accelerometers, gyroscopes and inertial measurement units) development, inertial navigation test and evaluation, radio frequency position, navigation and timing algorithm development and demonstration, and cold atom-based precision timing and inertial navigation systems research and development.</p>
<p>3. OVERVIEW OF INTEREST</p>
<p>A development effort is being considered to develop and demonstrate robust precision radiation hardened laser sources for use in atomic systems such as atomic frequency standards for space-based and strategic systems.</p>
<p>Technical responses are expected to demonstrate a detailed understanding of continuous wave (CW), narrow line-width lasers intended for alkali and alkali-earth atomic systems, particularly Rubidium (Rb), Cesium (Cs), Strontium (Sr), and Calcium (Ca). The laser system desired shall output on the order of 500 mW of CW power, be initially space radiation hardened with a feasible path to hostile radiation hardening, and designed in such a way to survive launch and operate on-board a space payload in Middle-Earth Orbit (MEO) with a feasible path to strategic system applications. It is anticipated that the initial task for this development will be a trade study of potential laser system architectures at any or all of the following frequency standards listed below:<br /><br />Element Wavelength(s) [nm]<br />Rubidium 778, 1556<br />Cesium 852<br />Strontium 461, 689, 922, 1378<br />Calcium 423, 657, 846, 1314</p>
<p>The trade study will identify system architectures which can fundamentally meet or exceed performance requirements under radiation and space launch environments. Subsequent tasks include the design, construction and testing of a prototype laser system. The system will be tested for both survivability and performance under a variety of natural and man-made radiation events including prompt dose, extended exposure of proton, gamma ray and x-ray radiation. Relative launch environments levels (e.g., vibration, shock, g-loading, and thermal vacuum) will be provided by AFRL separately upon request. While the prototype units are not expected to be flight-qualified, demonstration of launch suitability is a primary objective.<br />Interested parties will need the capability to perform across the entire technical area. Respondents may provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to meet all items in the technical area.</p>
<p>4. REQUESTED RESPONSE, FORMAT, &amp; SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Interested businesses are requested to submit a SOC no later than 22 December 2014 at 1200 p.m. (NOON); Mountain Standard Time (MST). For each Technical Area of interest, please provide sufficient written information to indicate capacity and any other specific and pertinent information that will enhance this effort. Each submission must address items 1-8 listed below. <br /><br />1. Company Name and Mailing Address<br />2. CAGE Code and DUNS Number<br />3. Respondent's technical and administrative POC, title, telephone number, and e-mail address.<br />4. Business Size Status (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Small business, Large Business, Historically Black College/University).

<DESC>IAW FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Global Command and Control System - Army (GCCS-A) is an enterprise command and control system that is developed using the Oracle distribution of the JAVA Runtime Environment (JRE) with portions hosted using the JAVA 2 Enterprise Environment (J2EE). The JRE, which includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is used to run software written in Java by executing the Java bytecode created from compiling Java programs. GCCS-A uses the J2EE to deploy enterprise web applications supporting Joint-to-Army and Army-to-Joint Interoperability. GCCS-A uses the JRE on all virtual servers, referred to as 'zones', hosting the various GCCS-A Server applications including: GCCS Family of Systems Alerting Infrastructure (GFAI) and associated web, Charting, Geolocation plotting service, Common Messaging Processor, Multi-Tactical Digital Information Links (TDIL) Capability, Theater Ballistic Missile Warning and Recording, Integrated Command, Control, Communications,Computers, & Intelligence (C4I) System Framework, External Transaction Manager Service, as well as for the client visualization applications for those services. In addition to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)-produced GCCS Server applications, GCCS-A uses the Oracle database software with Java dependencies for long term storage of tracked object locations, and for mediation between Army-internal communications, such as Data Dissemination System (DDS), and the GCCS Server applications. Java is the primarily development language within the GCCS-A enterprise and is thus an integral part of the software.

<DESC>ACC-RSA Contracting Center intends to issue on a sole-source basis a firm fixed priced purchase order to purchase A National Instruments (NI) PXI System. National Instruments hardware allows for project infrastructure (simulation/stimulation) communication over Operational signals necessary to operate system software.  Additional National Instruments products and licensed software is already utilized within the infrastructure and custom software code base. Therefore, utilizing this additional NI equipment would allow for complete custom code reuse and require no re-architecting of the infrastructure. A re-write of the custom code and re-architecting of the existing infrastructure would incur significant schedule and cost impacts. <br>  <br> Please reply no later than 1200 EST, 1 December 2014 to Kathy A.

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to award a renewal option under an existing lease using other than full and open competition, at 343 Thornall Street in Edison, NJ. The option will be for 19,676 rentable square feet of fully serviced space, net electric, for a term of up to five years, with the right to terminate.</p>
<p>There is a continuing need for space while the OCC accommodates its staffing needs. It has been determined that a five year lease extension will result in less cost to the Federal Government when the economics of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government's intention to award this lease option under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Amy Fuller at Amy.Fuller@occ.treas.gov or to her attention at The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Real Estate Services, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20219.

<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0007804
<CONTACT>Melissa K. Pine

<a href="mailto:Melissa.Pine@hq.doe.gov">melissa.pine@hq.doe.gov</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION.
The United States Department of Energy?s (DOE), Office of Headquarters Procurement Services, Office of the Under Secretary for Management and Performance intends to award a sole source modification. This modification is to existing contract DE-HS0000018, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) ? 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), to Paragon Technical Services Inc. (3455 Mill Run Drive, Suite 400, Hilliard, OH 43026-4400). The current contract is scheduled to expire on December 25, 2014. The proposed modification will be for a 180 day extension. This includes a three (3) month base and an additional three (3) one (1) month option periods. This modification will extend the existing contract to provide a continuation of services, until a new contract is awarded in response to DE-SOL-000576. The anticipated award date of the follow-on contract is no later than June 25, 2015. 
Due to being the incumbent contractor, Paragon Technical Services, Inc. is the only responsible source for the modification to extend the current contract.  Implementing this modification will prevent potential barriers, to accomplishing the agency?s mission, which would occur in the event of an interruption to the work currently being performed. Paragon Technical Services, Inc. provides fully trained and qualified personnel (armed and unarmed) to guard and protect the personnel, premises, facilities, and property  utilized by DOE HQ. The incumbent contractor understands the potential threats contained in the classified DOE Design threat Statement and knows how to apply these principles when developing site specific safeguards and security programs. Paragon also has strategies in place to counter the use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological); and the aspects of Presidential Decision Directives 39 and 62 dealing with terrorism and counter terrorism. The in cumbent has implemented complex security operations that are highly effective based on historical actions. Attempting to award a short-term contract to cover these requirements, pending award of the follow-on contract, is not reasonable. This entails a transition during a six month period, from the incumbent, to the short term contractor, and then to the follow-on contractor.  Not having a transition period and having a short term contractor creates significant potential for poor decision-making and could jeopardize national security. Under this proposed contract modification, the scope of work will not be modified. The mission of the protective force contract is the physical protection of critical security interests to include Classified and Sensitive Information, Property, Unclassified Facilities and personnel.  The applicable NAICS code is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard of $20.5M.  Continuous protective services are required 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. This is a notice of intent to award a modification under the current contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by December 11, 2014 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Responses must be submitted to Melissa Pine, Contract Specialist via email at Melissa.Pine@hq.doe.gov.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not harm security interests of the Department of Energy. DOE will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. This Notice in no way obligates the Government to award any modifications to the existing contract.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price.

A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.  <br>  <br> Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.    <br> Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.   <br>  <br>  <br> FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items <br> FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items  <br> FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items  <br> FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards <br> FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment <br> FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside <br> FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation <br> FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003) <br> FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012) <br> FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities <br> FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity <br> FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans <br> FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities <br> FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans <br> FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons <br> FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know <br> FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products <br> FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving <br> FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds <br> FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013) <br> FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award <br> FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim <br> FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit <br> DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials <br> DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country <br> DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)   <br> DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items  <br> DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items. <br> DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports <br> All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.   <br> 52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013) <br> (a) Definitions.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  

 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and technical acceptability.  The quoter will provide two (2) submissions:  Non-Price and Price.  The quoters Non-Price Submission will be considered more important that the quoters Price Submission.
  The Non-Price Submission will be composed of four (4) parts: Performance Approach, Corporate Experience, Past Performance, and Socio-Economic Plan.  Performance Approach will be considered the most important non-price factor.  Corporate Experience and Past Performance will be considered of equal importance to each other, and each will be considered less important than Performance Approach.  All other non-price factors will be considered significantly more important than the quoters Socio-Economic Plan.  The relative importance of the factors is as follows:


1.	Non-price:
    a.	Performance Approach;
    b.	Corporate Experience;
    c.	Past Performance; 
    d.	Socio-Economic Plan; and
2.	Price.


The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the Performance Work Statement (PWS) in the solicitation performed for Federal, State, or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
 Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past five years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the services were performed and the number (phone and/or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.  NOTE: QUOTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE CURRENCY AND ACCURACY OF THE CUSTOMER POINT OF CONTACT INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THEIR PAST PERFORMANCE SUBMISSION.  The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them.
 The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.
  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. 


System for Award Management (SAM). Quoters must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed online at https://www.sam.gov/. 

 
All quotes shall include price(s); FOB point; a point of contact, name, and phone number; GSA contract number, if applicable; CAGE Code and DUNS number; business size; and payment terms.
 Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

(End of provision)</p>
<p>Definitions. As used in this provision: "Foreign person" means any person other than a United States person as defined below. "United States person" means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. (b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not: (1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or, (2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. (End of provision)</p>
<p>(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act: (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country; (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person; (3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person; (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel; (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and, (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.</p>
<p>(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden "compliance with the boycott", and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above: (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements: (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or, (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment; (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation; (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country; (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel; (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and, (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The contractor shall submit a report outlining the condition of the upper portion of the stem.  Two anchor bolts attach the existing stem guides to the concrete wall.  The existing anchor bolts shall be cut flush to the wall.  Four anchor bolts are required to be installed for each new stem guide.  The new anchor bolts are required to be installed at a minimum of 4 inches away from the anchor bolts to be left in place.  This will require the position of the stem guides to be shifted.

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010025 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-77. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Production Approval Holder (PAH), a capable repair vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond.

If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The Component PAH is CEDSA-MADRID, Cage Code 7926B. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost. This is AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.<br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or<br />(2) o Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for providing recommendations to structure near-term implementation of smart grid technologies to expand its SCADA system as well as medium-term recommendations to allow for third-party generation inputs and electric vehicle charging networks.</p>
<p><br />BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>Ye&#351;il&#305;rmak Elektrik Da&#287;&#305;t&#305;m A.&#350;. (YEDA&#350;) is one of the 21 private electric distribution companies in Turkey, which serves 1,767,000 customers in the north service territory. Under the terms of the 30 year license with the Turkish Electrical Distribution Company (TEDA&#350;), which owns the electrical grid, YEDA&#350; earns revenue according to a tariff required to make capital investments in upgrades to the distribution grid.  Since 2010, YEDA&#350; has invested %50 million in the grid, and as a result of these investments has reduced the electrical loss amount from 10.35% to 8.28% in four years. YEDA&#350; is now targeting to reduce the losses to no more than 4% in its grid.</p>
<p>YEDA&#350; plans to implement second stage smart grid technologies to expand the capabilities of its existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.  The feasibility study will provide recommendations to structure near-term implementation of smart grid technologies to expand its SCADA system as well as medium-term recommendations to allow for third-party generation inputs and electric vehicle charging networks.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>This Feasibility Study will help to assess the technical, economic and financial feasibility for implementing second generation smart grid that will promote the efficiency of electricity distribution by expanding the capabilities of YEDA&#350; existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, which will also accommodate anticipated additional generation inputs.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $555,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<DESC>FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING DRAFT SOLICITATION. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.
<p>1. This pre-solicitation notice is being posted for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback concerning the attached DRAFT Solicitation. Response to the request for questions is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a Final Solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The request is for final planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is to provide a full range of responsive environmental remediation actions necessary to protect human health &amp; the environment. It includes rapid response and removal of environmental media contaminations and site restoration activities located on Base Realignment and Closure Bases (BRAC) in EPA regions 5-8 (Central). The BRAC Environmental Construction and Services Requirements Contract (BECSRC) is being contemplated to include a 5 year ordering period with 24 additional months for performance completion of services.</p>
<p>3. The purpose of soliciting and awarding this Requirements Contract is to have a tool in place for "pop-up" interim Environmental Remediation requirements. "Pop-ups" are unplanned, out-of-cycle requirements that occur periodically, but erratically on installations included in the BRAC Program Management Division portfolio. The BRAC Program Management Division, responsible for remediation and transfer of Air Force property affected by BRAC legislation, manages the disposal of Air Force property in accordance with BRAC law and the BRAC Master Plan to achieve early environmental resolution and early property disposal to return value to the Air Force and local communities. Requirements contracts are set up with one contractor to provide service (FAR 16.503). Generally speaking, an IDIQ obligates the Government to a minimum quantity/dollar amount at the time award, while a Requirements Contract guarantees the contractor no such minimum. <br />4. The contracting officer will conduct this source selection using a phased evaluation process which is sometimes referred to as a "down-select." To make the process more efficient, the contracting officer is limiting the amount of information that offerors must submit initially. The contracting officer shall notify offerors promptly in writing when their proposals are excluded from the competitive range or otherwise eliminated from the competition after which Evaluation Notices (ENs) will be sent to offerors within the competitive range as needed. Those offerors considered by the Contracting Officer to be within the competitive range will be asked to submit the Volume III (Pricing) and Volume IV (Sample Task Order) in Phase II of this source selection.<br />5. All questions/comments pertaining to the DRAFT RFP shall be provided to the Government for consideration in the provided matrix Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has a field for Section/Attachment Number, Applicable Region, Page # / Paragraph Reference and Question/Comment. Please ensure that both sheets and fields are completed in their entirety. <br />The Government is specifically requesting industry input on the adequacy and feasibility of the BESRC Pricing Matrix which includes tabs for Deliverables, Unit Pricing, and Labor Rates.</p>
<p>6. Request for Questions: The Government anticipates a final solicitation to be released Nov 07th 2014; however, this is subject to change depending on the amount of questions we receive. This notification is provided to allow early review of DRAFT solicitation documentation for this requirement. Questions concerning the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and attachments are due by 2:00 PM CT on October 31, 2014 to: rita.leal@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Jonathan Swall (Jonathan.Swall.1@us.af.mil) and Contract Specialist, Ms. Rita Leal at rita.leal@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS:<br />The Key Milestone Dates for BECSRC have been updated as of 26 Nov 2014 (Schedule information is subject to change without notice). Please see schedule below:</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Subject to the provisions contained herein, the Government intends to award a single contract resulting from the Solicitation, to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose Proposal conforms to the Solicitation's requirements (to included all stated terms, conditions, and all other information required by the Solicitation), and provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to satisfy the requirements of this Solicitation and the PWS. <br>  <br>    a. Evaluation criteria consist of two (2) evaluation factors. The Proposals will be evaluated under the following evaluation factors:  <br>  <br> 	Factor 1: Technical Capability  <br> 	 <br> 	Factor 2: Price <br>  <br>    b. Evaluation Factors. The Government's technical evaluation team will evaluate proposals to determine either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable (price excluded).   In order to be considered technically acceptable, the proposal for Factor 1 must be determined acceptable and must demonstrate an understanding of the requirements for all task areas described in the PWS. The proposal must demonstrate a practical/functional technical approach that meets the needs of the Solicitation. Failure to meet the criteria will render the proposal to be technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award. <br>  <br>       1) Factor 1: Technical Capability - To be deemed technically acceptable, the Offeror's Mission Capability must demonstrate: <br>  <br> a) An understanding of all tasks specified in this solicitation and describes how the requirement will be satisfied through clear methodologies, techniques, and detailed technical approach to meet the required objectives in the performance of technical requirements identified in PWS.  In evaluating, the assessment will concentrate on the offeror's plans for accomplishing the PWS requirements, to include proposed processes, schedule, and approaches.  Each proposal shall be evaluated on its ability to demonstrate a clear understanding of the contractual requirements and a corresponding plan to fulfill those performance requirements in the most effective and efficient manner possible for each functional task area.   <br>   <br> b) Organizational Structure.  The organizational line and block chart shall demonstrate a feasible structure to successfully manage the PWS requirements. An effective organizational structure that demonstrates whether the Offeror has all the necessary personnel qualifications, processes and plans in effect to ensure contract performance in accordance with the requirements of the PWS.  Personnel qualifications and minimum requirements for job standards must adequately support the requirements of the PWS.   The proposal must clearly demonstrate that all requirements of the PWS are met through identifying what parts of the organization are responsible for managing and accomplishing what work and clearly and rationally identify how the Offeror will successfully manage multiple tasks.  <br>  <br>       2) Factor 2: Price. The Offeror's price submission of all CLINs and Options will be evaluated considering the response to the solicitation.  The techniques and procedures described under FAR Part 15.404 will be the primary means of assessing price reasonableness. <br>  <br>    2. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  As part of price evaluation, the government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the Offeror's final option period price to the Offeror's total price.  Thus, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the Base Period, 1st Option Period, 2nd Option Period, 3rd Option Period, 4th Option Period, and 1/2 of the 4th Option Period. Offerors are not required to enter a price for the six-month period.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>  <br>    3. A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br> As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding six (6) months of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price.  Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period. <br>  <br> (x) Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.     <br>  Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.

Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.    <br>    <br>    <br>  FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items  <br>  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items   <br>  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items   <br>  FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards  <br>  FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment  <br>  FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside  <br>  FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation  <br>  FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)  <br>  FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)  <br>  FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities  <br>  FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity  <br>  FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans  <br>  FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities  <br>  FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans  <br>  FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons  <br>  FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know  <br>  FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products  <br>  FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving  <br>  FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds  <br>  FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)  <br>  FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award  <br>  FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim  <br>  FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit  <br>  DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials  <br>  DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country  <br>  DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)    <br>  DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items   <br>  DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.  <br>  DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports  <br>  All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.    <br>  52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)  <br>  (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.   <br>   Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.    <br>      <br>   Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.      <br>   Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.     <br>      <br>      <br>   FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items   <br>   FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items    <br>   FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items    <br>   FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards   <br>   FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment   <br>   FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside   <br>   FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation   <br>   FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)   <br>   FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)   <br>   FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities   <br>   FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity   <br>   FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans   <br>   FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities   <br>   FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans   <br>   FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons   <br>   FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know   <br>   FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products   <br>   FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving   <br>   FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds   <br>   FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)   <br>   FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award   <br>   FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim   <br>   FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit   <br>   DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials   <br>   DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country   <br>   DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)     <br>   DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items    <br>   DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.   <br>   DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports   <br>   All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.     <br>   52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)   <br>   (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.    <br>    Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.     <br>        <br>    Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.       <br>    Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.      <br>        <br>        <br>    FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items    <br>    FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items     <br>    FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items     <br>    FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards    <br>    FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment    <br>    FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside    <br>    FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation    <br>    FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)    <br>    FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)    <br>    FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities    <br>    FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity    <br>    FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans    <br>    FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities    <br>    FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans    <br>    FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons    <br>    FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know    <br>    FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products    <br>    FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving    <br>    FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds    <br>    FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)    <br>    FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award    <br>    FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim    <br>    FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit    <br>    DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials    <br>    DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country    <br>    DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)      <br>    DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items     <br>    DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.    <br>    DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports    <br>    All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.      <br>    52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)    <br>    (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.     <br>     Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.      <br>          <br>     Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.        <br>     Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.       <br>          <br>          <br>     FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items     <br>     FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items      <br>     FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items      <br>     FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards     <br>     FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment     <br>     FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside     <br>     FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation     <br>     FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)     <br>     FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)     <br>     FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities     <br>     FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity     <br>     FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans     <br>     FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities     <br>     FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans     <br>     FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons     <br>     FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know     <br>     FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products     <br>     FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving     <br>     FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds     <br>     FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)     <br>     FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award     <br>     FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim     <br>     FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit     <br>     DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials     <br>     DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country     <br>     DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)       <br>     DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items      <br>     DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.     <br>     DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports     <br>     All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.       <br>     52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)     <br>     (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.      <br>      Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.       <br>            <br>      Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.         <br>      Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.        <br>            <br>            <br>      FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items      <br>      FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items       <br>      FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items       <br>      FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards      <br>      FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment      <br>      FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside      <br>      FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation      <br>      FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)      <br>      FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)      <br>      FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities      <br>      FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity      <br>      FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans      <br>      FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities      <br>      FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans      <br>      FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons      <br>      FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know      <br>      FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products      <br>      FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving      <br>      FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds      <br>      FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)      <br>      FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award      <br>      FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim      <br>      FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit      <br>      DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials      <br>      DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country      <br>      DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)        <br>      DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items       <br>      DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.      <br>      DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports      <br>      All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.        <br>      52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)      <br>      (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.       <br>       Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.

The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.          <br>       Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.         <br>              <br>              <br>       FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items       <br>       FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items        <br>       FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items        <br>       FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards       <br>       FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment       <br>       FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside       <br>       FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation       <br>       FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)       <br>       FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)       <br>       FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities       <br>       FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity       <br>       FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans       <br>       FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities       <br>       FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans       <br>       FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons       <br>       FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know       <br>       FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products       <br>       FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving       <br>       FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds       <br>       FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)       <br>       FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award       <br>       FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim       <br>       FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit       <br>       DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials       <br>       DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country       <br>       DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)         <br>       DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items        <br>       DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.       <br>       DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports       <br>       All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.         <br>       52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)       <br>       (a) Definitions.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical capability, past performance and price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.        <br>        Technical capability will be determined by review of the information submitted by the offeror in Volume I    which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered items meet the technical requirements in the Statement of Work to provide a modular, certified SCIF facility.  A discussion or explanation of the offeror 's technical approach, capabilities and experience in providing modular SCIF facilities, specific experience in meeting ICD 705 standards and discussion of establishing and meeting delivery schedules should be addressed.  In the event there are proposal weaknesses or omissions, if significant, the Government, in its sole and broad discretion, may  deem strengths in other areas sufficient to achieve an overall acceptable rating.         <br>                <br>        Past performance will be evaluated considering relevancy and how well the contractor performed.  The government will evaluate past performance information provided by the offeror and may obtain past performance information from any other sources available to include but not limited to, CPARS, Contracting Officers, provided references or other data bases. Relevancy will be based on comparing previous project information (Exhibit A) to the Statement of Work requirements. For example, do previous projects demonstrate providing modular facilities of comparable size and scope for government customers?  To be determined Relevant, previous projects should demonstrate successful projects of similar scope, size, complexity, and cost magnitude, the offeror should have a documented history of relevant and successful performance.           <br>        Price will be evaluated by determining price reasonableness. Price evaluation will be inclusive of option.  The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to  quote mark Reasonableness quote mark  and  quote mark Realism quote mark   Affordability may also be considered.  A price reasonableness analysis is primarily concerned with determining whether or not an offered price is too high. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.   Proposals unrealistically low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and/or market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.          <br>                <br>                <br>        FAR 52.212-3 ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items        <br>        FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items         <br>        FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items         <br>        FAR 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards        <br>        FAR 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment        <br>        FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside        <br>        FAR 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation        <br>        FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)        <br>        FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (MAR 2012)        <br>        FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities        <br>        FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity        <br>        FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans        <br>        FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities        <br>        FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans        <br>        FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking Persons        <br>        FAR 52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention and Right to Know        <br>        FAR 52.223-15, Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products        <br>        FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving        <br>        FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds        <br>        FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (July 2013)        <br>        FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award        <br>        FAR 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim        <br>        FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit        <br>        DFARS 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials        <br>        DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country        <br>        DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Uniquie Identification and Valuation (DEC 2013)          <br>        DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items         <br>        DFARS 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to implement Statutes or Executive Orders applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items.        <br>        DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports        <br>        All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database @ www.sam.gov to be considered for award.          <br>        52.204-7 System for Award Management (Jul 2013)        <br>        (a) Definitions.

D.  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP):

Commercial Services Contract:  STERILIZER MAINTENANCE

1. PURPOSE: This QASP is a Government developed document used to ensure that the Government receives quality services, and pays only for services actually provided. The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish.

2. SCOPE: The role of Government Quality Assurance is to ensure contract standards are achieved. The QASP provides guidelines and methods for the Government's oversight of the Contractor's quality control efforts to assure timely, effective services are provided IAW the contract order. The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.

3. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

Contracting Officer (CO) - A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer and terminate contracts on behalf of the Government. The CO is the only person who can legally commit the Government and only the CO, as the Government's agent, can modify the contract/order. The CO is the final authority for determining the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. CO decisions arising under or relating to the contact are final.

Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - an individual designated in writing by the CO to perform specific technical and administrative functions within the scope and limitations of their written appointment (e.g., surveillance of Contractor's performance, accept services). The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or authorize any changes to the order/contract or in any way obligate additional funds by the Government; such authority' rests solely with the CO.

Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) - an individual designated by the requiring, activity to assist the COR and provide technical oversight of the Contractor's performance. The QAE's primary duty is to monitor the Contractor's performance by physically checking to see that tasks are completed. Reports are submitted, and desired outcomes are achieved. When a surveillance observation results in an unacceptable evaluation, the QAE will report the unacceptable performance to the COR. The QAE is not authorized to direct work, offer advice on how the work should be performed, change the contract, or in any way obligate payment of funds by the Government.

4. METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE:   Simplified methods of surveillance will be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance. The primary methods of surveillance are periodic assessments of service and customer feedback.

Periodic Assessment of Services - for services that occur over a number of months, the COR will evaluate Contractor performance on a quarterly basis and upon completion of services. Generally, the Government will rely on the Contractor's Quality Control system to ensure that services conform to contract quality requirements before they are tendered to the Government for acceptance.

Customer Feedback - Customer feedback is typically obtained via telephone or email. Telephonic customer complaints must be followed up in writing/email. To be considered valid, the customer complaint must clearly articulate the nature of the complaint, time, date, etc. The COR will investigate the complaint; if determined valid, the COR will advise the CO and the Contractor of the deficiency. Copies of valid complaints and the resolution must be retained in the official contract file.

5. SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURES:

The COR/QAE will evaluate the Contractor's performance quarterly against Performance Standards established in the contract/order. Evaluations will be to the extent practical to assure the contractor provides quality services IAW the requirements of the contract. Evaluations could be evaluation, /validation of contractor supplied performance data, as well as analysis of Customer feedback, for performance trends and to ensure valid customer concerns are resolved timely.
If at any time the COR/QAE receives indicators (e.g.. valid customer complaints or notes Performance Standards are not being met) that the Contractor's performance is less than acceptable, the COR/QAE will investigate to determine if this is a onetime issue that has been promptly corrected, or if the discrepancy is systemic in nature. If the issue is determined to be an isolated occurrence, the COR will continue with Quarterly Evaluations. If the issue is recurring and systemic in nature, the COR/QAE will perform more frequent evaluations.
The COR/QAE will notify the Contractor each time an unacceptable observation has been recorded and ask the Contractor to correct the problem. The COR will record the contract requirement, the specific deficiency to the requirement, the date and time it was discovered, and have the Contractor initial the entry. The Contractor will be given two working days after notification to correct the deficiency in accordance with requirements of the contract. Deficiencies that cannot be corrected within two working days will be reported to the Contracting Officer.

The COR/QAE will re-examine services that are found deficient. Failure to complete corrective actions will be reported immediately to the CO for further action.
Upon satisfactory completion of the work, the COR/QAE will accept the services provided and authorize payment, by approving the Contractor's invoice in Wide Area Workflow.

6. SURVEILLANCE STANDARD:
The Performance Standard set forth in the SOW and Line items is the standard the Contractor must meet for services to be deemed acceptable. Generally, under commercial services contracts, the Government is relying on the Contractor's assurances that the services conform to contract requirements. Consistent with FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, (a) Inspection and Acceptance, the Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those services that conform to the requirements of the contract/order. The Government may require re-performance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. The Government reserves the right to refuse acceptance of nonconforming services. In no case shall the Government's right to inspect services under the inspection provisions of the contract be prejudiced.

7. QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE FILE. The COR/QAE file should contain: 

	a. Copy of the COR appointment letter from the CO, any changes to that letter, and any 		    termination letters
	b. Training Certifications for COR 
	c. Copy of the contract and all contract modifications 
	d. Copy of the applicable Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) 
	e. Copy of the contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP)
	f. All correspondence initiated by authorized representatives (Contractor or Government) 	  	    concerning performance of the contract 
	g. Names, position titles and contact information of all key personnel assigned to this 	contract both Government and Contractor 
	h. Surveillance schedules 
	i. Surveillance Checklists 
	j. Records of all inspections performed and the results 
	k. Customer Feedback 
	l. Memoranda for record of minutes of any meeting, telephone conversations and 		 	    discussions with the contractor or others pertaining to the contract or contract  	 	  	    performance; 
	m. Documentation pertaining to acceptance of services, reports or data

8. RECORDS: All records will be retained for the life of this contract. The COR/QAE will forward these records to the CO upon completion of the contract/order.

9. CHANGES: The QASP is a living document and, as such, may be changed as needed. However, the CO must approve changes. The COR will submit recommended changes to the CO for approval.

<a href="mailto:pamela.frazier2@va.gov">Pamela.Frazier2@va.gov</a>
<DESC>Questions and Answers as of 11/26/2014:


1.	Who is the current EAP provider?  It was a large business locally.
2.	What is the current contracted cost for EAP services? 12,000-40,000 range
3.	What was the utilization for the EAP for the past 2 years? FY 2014 thru 6/2014 (3rd qtr - 118 new & pre-existing;  FY 2013 - 72;   FY 2012 - 120
4.	Page 3 (Statement of Work, Location Where Services Will be Performed). We are a national EAP provider and use a network model. While we do not physically have an office in Tuscaloosa we have several providers in our network of master's and doctorate-level licensed mental health professionals with private practices in Tuscaloosa and surrounding areas that would provide face-to-face EAP counseling services. Also, because we use a network of providers in private practice, we do not have offices with class rooms or conferences rooms as mentioned in with SOW. When we  conduct trainings/seminars for our customers, we send a local trainer onsite to the workplace, which generally would be much more convenient for the VA than having employees go offsite. Is this acceptable? EAP facility must have classrooms, conference rooms and play areas for child services and multiple, secure, private offices to accommodate several clients at one time.  Also must be able to provide workshops for all shifts, day, evening and nights.  Contractor staff must be available 24/7 to provide onsite crisis management services.  

5.	Page 10 of the RFP (Scope of Work) mentions the Program Coordinator notifying the COR if drug testing is needed. Please clarify if and how the EAP is to be involved in the VAMC's alcohol and drug testing beyond an employee who tests positive being referred to the EAP for assessment, referral, counseling and case management. An employee who test positive for illegal drugs must be referred to an Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling and referral for treatment or rehabilitation.  EAP provides to the employee written verification of attendance, completion of counseling and if needed, referral to a treatment or rehabilitation center.  The employee should provide the verifications to his/her supervisor and the supervisor should forward a copy of the verification to the Drug Free Workplace Coordinator to ensure the employee's attendance and compliance with the program.  If EAP determines that the employee requires treatment or rehabilitation beyond counseling, the treating facility should provide verification to the employee to provide to his/her supervisor who should forward this information to the Drug Free Workplace Coordinator to ensure compliance with EAP's recommendation to seek further assistance from a treatment or rehabilitation center.  Once an employee completes an EAP and/or treatment/rehabilitation program, he/she is subject to unannounced follow-up testing for a period of one year at a frequency of at least six times per year or per an amount stipulated in any applicable abeyance agreement.  If there is an abeyance agreement the Drug Free Workplace Coordinator should be notified of the specifics.  Follow-up testing is completed through a separate random pool maintained by the agency's Drug Free Workplace Coordinator and is carried out in the same manner as any other random test of employees.  I do not know of any reason for the COR to be notified and EAP does not order any  drug testing.   

6.	Page 44 of the RFP, can you please clarify the evaluation criteria? There seems to be some information missing from section (a) under E.1 52.212-2.  PRICE , TECHNICAL AND PAST PERFORMANCE
7.	Can the deadline of 11/28 be extended,  given 11/27, is a federal holiday to ensure there is enough time to prepare proposals in accordance with any questions and answers that have not yet been posted?  I extended to 12.05.2014

Thank you,

<DESC><br />RFI:<br />1)The violet or purple color will be the final color for the whole surface?<br />2) I don't see Moisture Vapor transmission test.Vapor moisture is the principal factor for coating failure. A MVT membrane is highly recommended,but it also affects the price. For a long durable coating and warranty MVT should not be ignored.
<p>RFI Response:<br />1) The violet/purple color will be the final color for the whole/entire surface.<br />2) A moisture vapor transmission test and vapor barrier are not required.<br />3) Estimate approximately 150 linear feet of joints (unit price per linear foot)<br />4) Estimate approximately 100 linear feet of cracking (unit price per linear foot)<br />5) The expansion/control joints shall be cleaned of all sealant/compound, then the epoxy/paint will be laid. Once the paint/epoxy is laid and dried, the KTR will apply a rapid-cure, elastomeric sealant as per the manufacturer's directions to adhere to the paint/epoxy coating.</p>

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month

VACATION: 3 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service includes the whole span of
continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and
with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same
Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin
Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and
Christmas Day.  A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another
day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)
(See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.


                         ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **

Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage
and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage
rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies
as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of
the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc."  (The
relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties)
contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting
"arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a)
of the regulations.  This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage
rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

The following are changes to the Combined Synopsis Solicitation No. VA248-15-R-0098:

1.	Amendment #3 is hereby issued against VA248-15-R-0098Combined Synopsis/Solicitation to extend the offers proposal due date to this solicitation from November 28, 2014 to December 9, 2014 at 10:00am, local, Puerto Rico time.

2.	Item 9.0 of the attached Performance Work Statement(PWS) - Emergency Services is hereby replaced with the following :
9.0 EMERGENCY SERVICES. The Contractor shall perform emergency response to situations arising from project activities. The Contractor shall perform emergency repairs to facilities, systems, improvements, or utilities damaged in the course of executing the contract requirements. Emergency service calls consist of correcting failures that constitute an immediate danger to personnel; threaten to damage property, or threaten to disrupt activity operations. Urgent service call consist of providing services or correcting failures which do not immediately threaten personnel, property, or activity missions, but will soon inconvenience and/or affect the health or wellbeing of personnel, and lead to property damage. Routine service calls will be classified as routine when the work does not qualify as an emergency or urgent call.

The contractor shall respond accordingly for emergency and urgent calls. A log shall be maintained of all service calls received; a description of the problem or requested work, date and time received location name and number. The contractor shall plan and schedule work to assure material, labor, and equipment are available to complete work requirements with regard to established time limits and quality standards. 

Upon notification of an emergency, the contactor shall respond within one (1) hour to the government and initiate emergency services.


3.	Amendment is issued to include as part of the combined synopsis/solicitation the following technical responses to the Site Visit 
held on Wednesday, October 29,2014:

1) When is the site visit for the Tanks located in the Ponce Clinic and Mayaguez Clinic scheduled?  During the site visit, the visit to these tanks in my view were "glossed over."
The offeror had the opportunity to evaluate 95% of the storage facilities units under this PWS contract, this includes equipment located in the San Juan Main Center Hospital. In addition it was discussed and evaluated that Emergency Generator and Day tank unit located in Ponce Clinic was similar or equal In terms of storage capacity and construction materials to the layout of Emergency Generator No. 4, located in the San Juan Medical Center. However, it was presented to the offerors, that drawing and photographs will be provided if needed. As of today, none of this information has been requested. Refer to attached, pictures and drawings from Ponce Clinic.
AST PONCE CLINIC:
1)	200 gallons AST Day Tank Emergency Generator 1750KW Caterpillar
2)	1,000 gallons AST Auxiliary Tank (Diesel Supply to the Day Tank)
3)	Galvanized steel fuel distribution line (single walled) from Auxiliary AST to Day Tank.
AST MAYAGUEZ CLINIC:
1)	For Mayaguez Clinic the government is still in negotiation with the lessor on the tests and inspections required for the units installed at the site. The CO will notify contractor of negotiated costs related to MOPC during the period of performance of this contract.
2)	In order to provide a good proposal, we request a table that includes the main characteristics of each AST & UST tanks that are included on the RFP. There is not enough information about the manufacture and capacity of each tank to be inspected and tested.

This is a performance based statement contract; the offeror must be capable to evaluate the components and elements. Each capacity is listed on the attachments provided in the RFP contract package. Refer to the attached file with list of fuel storage facilities.
3) What is the protocol when repair parts for "Correction" as a result from the "inspection" & "cleaning"? What is the cost limit for a repair part? The title of the Contract is Testing and Inspection, However during the walk through the Government Representative implied if there is any repair to be done then that is part of the contract.  So if a tank leaks, does it require the contractor to dig up the existing tank and repair with a new tank?
There is no cost limit for a repair parts. However, Section 5.6.2 requires the offeror to conduct an Deficiency report to assess and evaluate the operational conditions of the equipment and if necessary report any needs for repairs and or replacement of parts to ensure adequate and continuous fuel operation. The contractor will prepare a quote in accordance with the deficiency report, submit this quote to the CO for approval if the quote is <$2,500 threshold for materials and labor. Approval of these repairs will be communicated through the CO and coordinated with COR. For cost of the repairs or replacement is exceeds or is higher than $2,500, then this requirement will be considered additional work and shall be accomplished via modification to the existing contract or separate contract action. The additional repair work is not included in the basic contract price and shall be negotiated separately between the contractor and CO. The Government and the contractor will perform a 100% joint inspection to ensure that the additional repair work was performed and accepted.
4) Scope of work is not clear on the dollar limit of repair or type of repair to be performed or type of parts to be replaced.  Also during an emergency call, if a piece of equipment is damaged, are we to replace the equipment (e.g. a pump)?  Again, emergency calls should be limited in scope in terms of time and materials.  Right now the "discretion of the CO" is too wide and it is difficult to put a price on the work for an emergency call with repairs.  
Emergency Services will only be requested by CO/COR when services are required of the Contractor to respond to unplanned/unscheduled event regarding the equipment. Upon arrival the Contractor is to assess the situation (e.g. inspection the equipment), diagnose the issue and provide a quote to the government outlining the cost (i.e. broken down by labor cost (e.g. number of hours and hourly rate), materials costs etc. to complete the repairs, prior to performing the work. The quote will be used to established fixed price for performance of the work. 
Emergency calls are defined in the Section 9.0 as correcting failures that constitute an immediate failure to personnel, threaten to damage property or threaten to disrupt activity operations.
Two (2) episodes occurred during this past FY 2014,   
1)	Failure to maintain pressure at the main fuel distribution line from Diesel Fuel Supply system to the ASTs located emergency generators 6-13. 
2)	Vapor accumulation at the USTs 6,7,8,9, and 10. Accumulation impacted the fuel transfer operations from tanker truck to the USTs. 
These two episodes affected fuel distribution operations, and impacted mission essential services such as maintaining continuous operations of standby power during electrical shutdowns.
This is too open ended and can lend to abuse by the contractor or the Government.  Most test and inspection contract set limits to Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) parts during annual or monthly maintenance.  If a control board is defective is the Contractor's responsibility to replace it at cost of the contract or is there a work order and PO procedure in place for follow on work? 
The Government does not have the intention to abuse the contractor nor misleading the contractor to estimate annual or monthly inspection requirements. The Government expects that the offeror will be able to meet government requirements under this PWS. The offeror must indicate if the company has the capabilities to meet the requirement for emergency calls.
5) How you determine the number of emergency calls in a calendar year? Can the Contracting Officer provide a historical data of emergency calls for the last two years? 
How you classify the emergency for this maintenance project?
 Refer response to question No. 4.
6) A what time of the day can tests and inspections be performed for the testing of the fuel lines or the tanks?  What is the protocol to test while insuring service in the event of a shutdown?  Will testing be allowed during regular hours or limited to "later" times in the day or weekend? Please specifies which tanks or lines will be tested after regular time? 
 As discussed under paragraph 15.3 Hours of operation, testing and inspections can be conducted during the operating hours from 700am to 4:30pm. The contractor must be aware that services must continue and disruptions must be prevented.  If shutdown of the utility is required, coordination with COR must be conducted in order to notify users and FMS. 
7) Can you please provide the warranty log of the AST & UST tanks and auxiliary equipment that needs to be tested?
The offeror must perform the required tests as per manufacturer recommendations. Refer to the attached list for fuel storage tanks manufacturers.
8) During the site visit it was mentioned that the boiler system cannot be stopped for testing of lines. All line testing equipment require a minimum of 6 hours between delivery and testing. In addition it requires a minimum of 30 minutes between dispensing and testing, this mean none product movement during testing are allow. Please clarify.
Fuel Delivery is scheduled twice (2) per month to the Boiler UST No.3 (20,000 gallons). Delivery is scheduled after 4:00 pm, therefore if 6 hours are needed prior to conduct the required tests, fuel delivery will not impacted the results of these tests. At least 12 hours will be sufficient prior to conduct these tests. There are no dispensing operations at the Boiler Steam Plant system. UST No.2 and UST No. 3 are alternating fuel supply storage which provides diesel fuel to the boiler system. If one of these tanks is scheduled for a tightness test, COR can coordinate which of these tanks can be tested based on the current use of fuel supply, after the test is completed, then contractor will proceed to test the alternate tank. This process will minimize the impact to boiler operations without impacting the scheduled tests of these units. AST Boiler tank feeds from the main USTs (either No. 2 or No. 3) every 8 hours/once per shift. Sufficient time is allowed to conduct the AST tightness test.
9) What kind of top has the vertical tank and a what pressure this tank will be testing?
 This is a performance base contract; the offeror must evaluate and determine the psi needed to conduct this test. The offeror must perform the required tests as per manufacturer recommendations Keep in mind, this AST is still non-operational and construction of Boiler Upgrade Project is still ongoing. 
10) The CP protection of steel line should have a dielectric union to provide the necessary isolation. Without a dielectric union to isolate the tank from the steel pipe or insulation to prevent bare copper tubing from touching, the tank through a metal dome, the current can collect on interconnected underground copper and steel pipe that connects.
The UST No. 2 has a galvanic CP protection with a sacrificial anode attached to the coated steel fuel line. During the walkthrough, offeror had the opportunity to observe the CP test port on which the tester will conduct the CP tests.
11) The Convault tanks manufacturer needs to approval the test according to the manufacturer operation manual, otherwise the 30 years warranty can be avoided. Please clarify.
Refer to Onsite Convault procedures to conduct tank tightness test and the recommended inspection checklist from STI-001 for monthly field inspections. In addition, please refer to the integrity test of convault tank letter dated 02/21/2014. Although tank tightness tests to the primary tank are not recommended by the manufacturer , if tests are needed Convault recommended to conduct test up to 3 psi, and tank  must be pressurized   using inert gas such as nitrogen. This requirement will apply to all convault tanks on San Juan facilities including the 10,000 gallons AST Gasoline Tank, 10,000 gallons AST Ethanol Tank, 1,000 gallons South Bed Tower AST, 1,000 gallons Community Living Center. Refer to the attached list for detail information.  However, monthly inspections are still needed as part of the scope of this PWS. Tank tightness tests on Convault ASTs be conducted as necessary( e.g repairs or during leaks), as recommended by the manufacturer, therefore Technical Exhibit No. 2 list a total of 21 AST tank tightness tests, only 17 are expected to be conducted.
12) What kind of inspection the UST and AST are required by the client, there are several inspection methods as per RP 900 and RP1200 according with PEI recommendation.
PEI RP 900 UST Inspection and Maintenance Checklist-Section 5.4 requires to offeror to conduct monthly and annual inspection. 
PEI RP 1200 Testing and Verification of Spill, Overfill, Leak Detector and Secondary Containment Equipment at UST Facilities.
PREQB-Tank Inspection Form. 
STI 001 Form as recommended by Convault manufacturer.
13) Will the Cathodic protection for the day- tanks of the generators be coating procedure ?  Have those tanks have any ground contact? If so, the ground contact only will be protected the bottom of the tanks.  Please clarify.
AST has a cathodic protection from coating paint. In order to maintain cathodic protection, coating must be evaluated to maintain corrosion protection barrier not only to the AST but to the fuel distribution lines as well. Cathodic protection can be evaluated by determine conditions of the coating protection at each day tank. These conditions must be documented in the monthly inspection required under this PWS.
14) In order to provide a valid certification for the tested lines, we require a list with the full capacity in gallons that can be hold all the single lines included on the RFP. Since the line tester equipment are certify for a limit of gallons, if the gallons are over the limit of what the national work group  approved this testing will be a diagnostic not a certification.
 
Offeror should have the knowledge of the Association and/or group for this type of question. This is a performance based work contract, the offeror must evaluated and calculated the amount of fuel at the fuel lines.
15) Who is responsible for the waste generate during the tank cleaning service? Is there any valid current permit approved by the PREQB that allow the contractor to dispose of any hazard material? Or the Department of Veterans Affairs will be responsible to dispose this material after the contractor storage the waste using a 55 gallon drum?  Please Clarify.
 The contractor shall remove the sludge and water from fuel storage tanks units and place it into 55 gallons drums for government waste disposal. Drums must meet DOT requirements for waste transportation and disposal, properly label, and characterized (Contaminated e.g. diesel fuel). The government will dispose waste in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency and PR Environmental Quality Board (PREQB) hazardous and no hazardous waste regulations. The contractor is required to coordinate with the government time and location of the tank cleaning operations, in order for the government to prepare temporary storage areas, and schedule for waste disposal. The offeror is encouraged to conduct cleaning methods such as filtration to minimize waste generation. The Contractor shall pump all usable gasoline and diesel fuel back into the tank. 
16) We understand that Suction Lines does not need any leak detections according with EPA. No leak detection is required if the suction piping has the following characteristics:
1.     The piping has enough slope so that the product in the pipe can drain back into the tank when suction is released,
2.     The piping has only one check valve, which is as close as possible beneath the pump in the dispensing unit.
 If a suction line is to be considered exempt based on the previous design elements, there must be some way to check that the line was actually installed accordingly. Please clarify.
If a suction line does not meet all of the design criteria noted above, one of the following leak detection methods must be used
"	 A line tightness test at least every 3 year, or
"	Monthly interstitial monitoring; or
"	Monthly vapor monitoring; or
"	Monthly groundwater monitoring; or
"	Monthly statistical inventory reconciliation
 Suction lines should have a ball valve to isolate the lines for the tank, this include supply and return lines as well. Do they have this? 
Please clarify what will be the correct procedure for testing suction lines?
The offeror must comply with the PREQB testing requirements. The USEPA has delegated the Underground Storage Program to the PREQB. Additional components or elements to comply with the tank or line tightness tests must be identified by the offeror.


4.	Amendment is issued to attach a List of Manufacturer. (Refer only to columns 1 through 6).

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Regional Specialist position was developed in response to a significant increase in USAID's portfolio of countries that face various forms of fragility or crisis as well as an increase in demand for OTI's experience and programming methodology. As USAID's lead operational unit for crisis intervention programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially-based technical advice and analysis, and explore countries that face possible political crises earlier in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.<br /> <br />As a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen, Europe &amp; Eurasia, and Asia (YEA) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will be based in Thailand and will report to the Washington-based OTI YEA Team Leader. As the senior OTI representative in the field, the Senior Regional Specialist will represent and serve as a liaison between OTI and a wide array of individuals and institutions including USAID Field Missions, other DCHA office representatives, regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad on political transition, conflict and post-conflict issues in the region. The Senior Regional Specialist will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs in the region as well as proposed and potential country program sites, serving as OTI's senior official in the region, and may be called upon to support other regions as needed. The Senior Regional Specialist will serve as the agent of the OTI Team Leader and, when designated, will have supervisory authority when working with OTI country teams. This position will include extensive travel, particularly within the Asia and Eurasia region.<br /> <br />The Senior Regional Specialist will train, mentor, backstop, and support OTI country teams, including Country Representatives, Deputy Country Representatives, and other staff on the OTI business model, procedures, minimum program requirements, and best practices. He or she will help to determine the learning and training needs of in-country staff, and contribute to broader office policy and process discussions to promote state-of-the-art transition programming. Through coordination with OTI's Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will stay abreast of current thinking, policy determinations, lessons learned and best practices from other regions, while at the same time cultivating and sharing best practices found in the field. Through on-the-ground knowledge of OTI country programs, the Senior Regional Specialist will contribute to the refinement of OTI's learning and training strategy, training regimes, and materials for staff in country programs as well as office surge staff known as the Bullpen.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Regional Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.

<p>ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC> <br>  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) in support of the Project Manager Mission Command (PM MC) is seeking information on how interested sources can provide Software Development services to support Army requirements.  PM MC is responsible for the design, development, integration, and maintenance of a cohesive software infrastructure and interoperability capability for the Army and other Joint Partners.    <br>  The Common Software family of products is a critical enabler of horizontal and vertical integration of the Mission Command Warfighting Function.  Common Software provides common functionality among non-common systems; it is a force multiplier in both the Common Operational Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environments (CPCE), and reflects elements of the ten (10) Mission Command Essential Capabilities (MCEC). Services are specifically targeting the completion of software development efforts which have previously started but not completed under an existing contract.  Effort was originally awarded under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) Contract Numbers W15P7T-09-D-N005 through 0010. The Government requires six (6) months of additional services as described above.  <br>  Interested sources should review the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and the attached Market Survey questions to assess their ability to perform the requested services.  Interested sources should submit responses to the questions and requested supporting documentation to Nina.M.Bushnell.civ@mail.mil and Nikeena.S.Brown.civ@mail.mil. Responses should also include 1.) Company Name and Point of Contact, to include address, fax number, email and website, 2.) DUNS Number and CAGE code. Responses and supporting documentation are due by 10 December 2014 at 1pm EST. Reference Common Software Development in all correspondence.  <br>

<p>Two keynote speakers will address the Army's future training efforts.</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Robert B. Brown, Commander of the Combined Arms Center, will talk about executing realistic training in support of the Human Dimension Concept.

McMaster, Director of the Army Capabilities and Integration Center, will discuss the Army of 2025 and Beyond. Force 2025 will require land power concepts and capabilities for the Joint Force as integrated and innovative solutions within Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF).<br /><br />Their speeches will be followed by two senior leader panels discussing:</p>
<p>&bull; The complex operational environment, Force 2025 and Beyond, and desired realistic training.</p>
<p>&bull; The evolution of training toward one live-synthetic training environment and the Army's modernization challenges in enabling realistic training today.</p>
<p>These topics were discussed at similar engagements at an Association of the United States Army convention and the Inter-Service/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
<p><br />PROJECT TITLE:  Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) Argo Floats</p>
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Supplies to be delivered to:<br />Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)<br />Seattle, Washington</p>
<p>NAICS CODE:  334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:  Argo (www.argo.net) is an international effort to measure the temperature and salinity fields in upper two km of the global ocean by populating it with an array of approximately 3500 profiling floats equipped with CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) instruments that telemeter their data to shore with minimal delay</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to provide a model of profiling floats as specified below:</p>
<p>Float Specifications/Requirements:<br />Provide profiling floats as specified below that are deployment-ready (calibrated, assembled, ballasted, weighed, and tested), equipped with conductivity-temperature-depths (CTD) capable of sampling temperature, salinity, and pressure continuously throughout their ascent, then reducing those data by bin averaging at specified pressure intervals as close as 1 or 2 dbar. Floats should determine position by global positioning system (GPS) before transmitting those data to shore via Iridium (in either Router-Based Unrestricted Digital Internetworking Connectivity Solutions (RUDICS) or Short Burst Data (SBD) format). Float must be capable of a gross fractional volume change of at least 1.15% and ballasted to allow profiling from 2000 dbar to the near-surface (4 to 1 dbar, shallower is better) in all regions of the ocean.</p>
<p>Float Specifications/Requirements: <br />(1) Floats must be capable of a minimum gross fractional volume change of 1.15% and ballasted to allow cycling between the surface and 2000-dbar pressure over the entire global (ice-free) ocean.<br />(2) Floats must be able to park for predetermined 1-20 day periods at a different predetermined subsurface pressure than their profiling pressure ("park and profile" capability).<br />(3) Floats must be capable of continuously sampling from 2000 dbar to the near surface (4 to 1 dbar, shallower is better) then reducing those data by bin averaging at specified pressure intervals as close as 1 or 2 dbar.<br />(4) Floats must have sufficient energy in their delivered configuration (or after retrofitting to lithium batteries by the Government) to perform the above functions for a minimum period of at least 6 years with a duty cycle of 10 days (219 or more cycles).  More cycles are better.<br />(5) Floats must have demonstrated performance, with examples of deployed instruments successfully performing the above functions for at least 80 cycles. More cycles and higher survival rates are better.<br />(6) Floats must be light enough (&lt;30 kg) to ensure that deployments from a variety of platforms including volunteer observing ships (VOS) are feasible.  Lighter is better. <br />(7) Floats must be delivered to the Government FBO Destination in boxes sufficiently sturdy to protect the floats prior to deployment, while in transit, and onboard ship or aircraft. <br />(8) Float boxes must be built to accommodate stacked loading and moveable with a forklift or pallet jack, and be suitable for export to most countries (e.g. all wood components of appropriately treated plywood). <br />(9) Float CTDs must have average initial measurement accuracies of +/-0.002 C in temperature, +/-0.005 PSS-78 in salinity, and +/-3 dbar in pressure. <br />(10) Float CTDs must report back data to a resolution of 0.001 C in temperature, 0.001 PSS-78 in salinity, and 1 dbar in pressure.<br />(11) Float CTDs must have demonstrated reliability and stability of +/-0.01 C in temperature, +/-0.02 PSS-78 in salinity, and +/-6 dbar in pressure over multi-year missions.<br />(12) Floats must send back sufficient data to determine their vertical ascent rate through any given measurement bin to within an accuracy of  +/-10%.<br />(13) Float CTDs must use a system that ensures temperature and conductivity measurements are made within the same controlled volume of water. <br />(14) Float CTDs must employ conductivity cells with antifouling protection by diffusion of tri-butyl tin in a controlled volume (no cell coatings). <br />(15) Floats (and accompanying instrumentation, including CTDs) must pass Government tests for performance to the satisfaction of Government personnel, or be replaced/repaired by the contractor at the contractor's expense (including shipping costs in both directions) and arrive at the specified Government delivery address within 2 months of notification to the contractor by the Government of a problem and availability of float for shipping from the specified Government address. <br />(16) Contractor must provide the Government any unusual or customized tools required for float modification, repair, and communication (e.g. special wrenches, vacuum fittings, communications interfaces, and so on), as well as initial training (Government personnel may travel to a Contactor's facility at Government expense for this purpose) and subsequent advice for Government personnel in float testing, repair, and communication as requested by the Government. <br />(17) Contractor must provide a manual or manuals (and any associated software) that include instructions on deployment, float self-tests, and data decoding specifics. <br />(18) Floats must be capable of self-activation upon deployment. <br />(19) Floats must be designed to withstand shipment including by land, sea, or air, prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Desirable But Not Essential Instrument Features:<br />(1)  Biodegradable packaging enabling deployment from a rapidly moving vessel <br />(2) Floats with sufficient energy in their standard configuration to perform the above functions for more than 6 years with a duty cycle of 10 days (more than 219 profiles).<br />(3) Iridium/GPS floats using Iridium SBD rather than Iridium RUDICS.<br />(4) Floats with tested ice detection and avoidance software.</p>
<p>TENTATIVE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  December 19, 2014</p>
<p>TENTATIVE PROPOSAL DUE DATE:  January 22, 2015</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) develops and supports a comprehensive integrated health information system of systems which supports a broad range of clinical and business functions at IHS, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) hospitals and clinics across the country. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is similar to the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) in use at the Veterans Administration, having been derived from the same legacy system and sharing many of the same infrastructure and business applications. The RPMS as currently deployed has a MUMPS (Intersystems Cache) database architecture and VA FileMan file structures. A number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications utilizing various languages ranging from Delphi to C# .NET have been developed to support certain business processes, while other applications retain legacy character-based interfaces. RPMS GUI applications principally use a two-tiered architecture utilizing broker-based remote procedure calls, although recent development has focused on a three-tier architecture using web services. For more information on the portfolio of supported applications, visit: http://www.ihs.gov/RPMS/ <br />Business functions supported by the RPMS include, but are not limited to, practice management (e.g. patient registration, scheduling, billing and accounts receivable, release of information), ancillary clinical applications (e.g. inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, image archiving, consults and referrals), and point of care clinical applications for behavioral health, inpatient and ambulatory care. The RPMS is certified as a Complete Electronic Health Record for inpatient and ambulatory settings according to the 2014 version certification criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. In recent years, the system has been extended to include a personal health record system, Direct secure messaging, a health information exchange (HIE) service, and supporting middleware services. In recent years the architecture and complexity of IHS health IT systems as well as their criticality to health care operations have become an impetus for IHS to re-evaluate its current approach to software development.<br />This Sources Sought Notice seeks to identify companies that have capability to provide full lifecycle software development, architecture, and operations support services to assist IHS with evolving the RPMS, as well as the software lifecycle programs and processes around the system, to align with current best practices in application architecture, design and management. The IHS strategy includes improvements in data modeling and mapping, transition to a true service-oriented architecture (SOA), and harmonization of disparate GUIs into a common interface framework compliant with accessibility and usability best practices in a platform-independent context (i.e. support for Web, mobile, machine, and other ancillary interfaces).

<DESC>The detection capability requiring the Superscript consumable is critical in the DoD's ability to detect the BW agent Ebola; a supply gap caused by the time it would take to prove equivalency of another consumable would otherwise cripple the Department of Defense's Ebola detection capability. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency the CRP requests an urgent contract action using other than full and open competition. The action is not available for a limited competition as only Thermo Scientific, Inc sells the proprietary product, SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase that has been approved for use by the FDA in the EZ-1 EUA Assay kit.
