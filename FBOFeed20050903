No zylon, spectra or shield type products will be accepted.  The general specifications are:  Body armor shall meet National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ) National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC) certification to provide protection against Type II threats (9mm and .357 magnum).  A letter of compliance issued by NLECTC and samples shall accompany the contractor’s proposal in response to this solicitation.  All units sold as being in compliance with NIJ standards shall be constructed identical to the model submitted to!  NLECTC for testing and which was found to comply with the requirements of NIJ Standard 0101.04 and 0115.00.  The label on each unit must be included on the protective panel and identify Type II protection and compliance with NIJ Standards 0101.04 and 0115.00.  Each unit of armor provided under the resultant contract shall be warranted for a minimum of five years to be free from all defects in materials and workmanship.  Each unit of armor provided under the resultant contract shall be warranted for a minimum of five years to meet the ballistic-resistant and deformation requirements of NIJ Standards 0101.04 and 0115.00.  Note – Body armor certified to either 0101.03 or 0101.04 is acceptable.  Body armor is concealable and worn as a protective undergarment under the normal uniform shirt, relatively comfortable, lightweight, and not unduly restrictive of movement.  Body armor (male and female) shall provide full front, side, and rear protection with the wrap-around portion goi! ng from front to back using a hook-and-pile tape fastening system.  Metal fasteners are prohibited since they can become secondary missiles.  Hook-and-pile tape fasteners shall be at least 1½ inch wide with 2 inches of adjustment.  Fasteners shall be anchored to good-quality elastic, approximately 3 inches long to facilitate proper adjustment and to compensate for body movement.  Body armor for female officers shall conform to the female anatomy.  It is critical that the joined pieces overlap each other a minimum of 1 inch.  Ballistic panels shall be contained in pouches in a polyester/cotton carrier.  Design elements shall meet the following requirements:  Shoulders, neck, and armholes shall be feathered to minimize bulk and maximum comfort at these areas, but still not reduce protection; shoulder straps shall be wide enough for comfort and to distribute the weight of the armor, but not so wide as to restrict movement; seam construction of the armor shall allow maximum flex! ibility and yet maintain protective coverage; the armor shall permit size adjustments while retaining protective integrity for the sides of the torso; the length of the armor should not be too long so that it will not be pushed up into the throat when the officer sits or bends; the armor shall be wide enough to allow the front panel to overlap the back panel; the carrier for the armor material shall have a tail that can be tucked into the pants to prevent the armor from riding up; body armor shall protect against 9mm full metal jacketed round nose (FMJ RN) bullets with nominal masses of 8.0g (124gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 358 m/s (1175 ft/s) or less and .357 Magnum jacketed soft point (JSP) bullets with nominal masses of 10.2g (158gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 427 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less.  Body armor also provides protection against Type I and Type IIA threats.  Type II body armor is required to prevent penetration from the impact of six bullets per pan! el at specified velocities and locations for two types of ammunition.  The deformation of the backing material for blunt trauma protection must not exceed 44mm (1.73in).  Body armor shall continue to provide NIJ standard Type II ballistic protection when wet.  Vests shall be manufactured using materials that are waterproof or are treated with water repellants or have a permanent water-repellant covering such as rip-stop nylon or both.  Body armor is required to resist the penetration of bullets striking at an angle to the surface.  Armor shall provide Type II protection regardless of the angle of impact.  Body armor shall meet the V50 ballistic limit where no penetration is expected or allowed.  Body armor shall meet NIJ Standard-0115.00 for stab-resistant body armor; shall stop engineered or high-quality blades such as kitchen knives or those purchased at sporting good stores and capable of defeating 24 joules of energy.  Delivery is FOB Destination to Sugar Grove, WV.  The!  NAICS is 315991.  The FSC is 8470.  Offerors are required to submit with their quotes a letter of compliance issued by NLECTC for the proposed body armor vest.

Type II body armor is required to prevent penetration from the impact of six bullets per pan! el at specified velocities and locations for two types of ammunition.  The deformation of the backing material for blunt trauma protection must not exceed 44mm (1.73in).  Body armor shall continue to provide NIJ standard Type II ballistic protection when wet.  Vests shall be manufactured using materials that are waterproof or are treated with water repellants or have a permanent water-repellant covering such as rip-stop nylon or both.  Body armor is required to resist the penetration of bullets striking at an angle to the surface.  Armor shall provide Type II protection regardless of the angle of impact.  Body armor shall meet the V50 ballistic limit where no penetration is expected or allowed.  Body armor shall meet NIJ Standard-0115.00 for stab-resistant body armor; shall stop engineered or high-quality blades such as kitchen knives or those purchased at sporting good stores and capable of defeating 24 joules of energy.
